"I'll call the person I'm interested in Jane [16 F]. She moved from another state in June, and is new to the school I go to. We met about 2 months ago, for which we've been pretty good friends for about a month. The only time I see her is during marching band practice after school and our band class during school. 
 When I got her number, I asked her to go to a performance with me, for which she declined, but asked for a rain check. Later I asked her to go to Sonic with me after band practice, but she flaked the morning of. I decided to stop pursuing her for awhile until about a week later I would give her one more chance. This time she did agree to go to lunch with me during school on Wednesday, and followed through. I found out a lot more about her and we shared a lot of interests and hobbies, and not to mention we talked extremely well together. 
 Over the next couple of weeks I continued to ask her to go to things with me. Continuing from the same week, I asked her to go to an event after school on Friday, which she declined.  The next week, I asked if she wanted to eat lunch with me the week after the first time (we only share lunches together on Wednesday), to which she said she had homework to catch up on. Then, she finally agreed to go to dinner with me during a band competition on Saturday. It went great and as usual, we talked extremely well together and found out more about each other. 
 We had another band competition on Monday, but we had a small rehearsal before and then a couple hours of rest until the competition later that night. I asked her the night before if she wanted to hang out a bit during that time, but she never responded, I never got a chance to talk to her about it during rehearsal. 
 Before I get on to the next part, let me tell you something about Jane. As I said, we talk extremely well together when we do, but the problem is she barely initiates conversation with me. It confuses me because it seems like she is interested in me but I don't know if she is shy or just not interested in me. 
 Tuesday, I decided to send her message saying how I really liked her, and how I looked forward to seeing and talking to her everyday, but it seems liked she wasn't interested/comfortable coming up and talking to me and asked her what she thought of me. She responded saying that I'm a great guy and said that she hopes it's not cliche if she says ""its not you, its me."" At the end of her message she said I was one of the only good friends she has made at this school and appreciates me reaching and talking to her. I'm not really sure if she friend zoned me here but I don't really believe in the friend zone and I can get out anyways. I asked if she wanted to go to lunch tomorrow, and agreed. Lunch went well, and I mentioned a performance that I suggested we go to. I texted her the time for it later that night and asked if she was available then, but got no response. Fast forward to today, the day that performance is, I sent her another message asking if she was available for tonight. Before I sent this text message, I knew that I would probably get declined and I was like inb4 she has too much homework. And I was right. She said that has a ton of homework and probably won't have enough time. I sent that 7 hours before it was supposed, so I'm starting to not believe it. 
 Anyways, here is what I need help on. Honestly, the only thing I don't like about Jane is how she still doesn't seem interested in talking to me, despite the things she has said. How can I get her to talk to me? Also, I'm kind of a noob when it comes to dating, so how I can I step it up to the next level with her? 
 Secondly, one pattern I've noticed about Jane is that we have only hung out if it coincided with one of out activities. The times we've have talked for a good half hour to an hour were two times during school lunch, and one time during at a band competition. Now the hypothesis that I want to make is that she is that doesn't want to tell her parents that she is hanging out with a guy, whether that's because her parents don't allow her or she is too shy to tell. How do I approach her and talk to her about this without sounding too weird? 
 Finally, if things don't work out with her, I'll gladly move on, but the thing is I can't seem to get her out of my mind. When I broke up with my ex-girlfriend, I did it at the end of school, so I wasn't going to see her for awhile, and that allowed me to clear my mind of her. The problem with Jane though is that we have class together, and there's no way to not see her. Any advice for moving on? 
 tl;dr : Me and a girl that I'm interested in talk together extremely well together, but it seems like she is not interested in initiating conversation with me. How do I get her to talk to me?";16;F;FALSE;0
"I worked with a guy for a little over 9 months, we really hit it off, we are very similar in both lives, backgrounds and humor styles. We talk about 3 times a week over skype, and share many hobbies like playing video games while creating interesting drinking games. 
 Last weekend I had plans to go to a different friend's party on Saturday night. I had a few drinks and ended up spending the night there. There is no cell service at his house so I had no idea that my 29M friend was hoping I'd get on skype with him to celebrate his birthday. His birthday was actually that Thursday, but he had waited for the weekend to really celebrate. I had not missed the actual day. 
 He had off hand mentioned that his wife had bought him a hotel room so he could get away from his very young kid for a night and just relax. He said he wanted to spend the day programming, and possibly party that night. I told him that I couldn't make any promises for that night. 
 Here is where I need advice. When I finally got home I get 3 text messeges from him asking where I was. and a fourth final one saying 
 ""wft guys i was counting on u tonight."" 
 After reading this my heart sank. I feel like I have betrayed someone on their birthday who I value as a close friend. I responded saying that I was at a different place with out cell service and that I messed up and that I'd try to make it up to him. 
 I feel especially bad because he has not responded in almost 48 hours now. He is usually a calm and rational person, but he is older than me, and I'd like some perspective on what he is going through so I can deal with this better. I've been included into his main friend group and he is in mine. I'd like to do something to resolve this to prove that I didn't mean to blow him off, especially because of the cost of the hotel room, I feel awful for doing this to someone I care about, who I also view as my ""adult"" friend. 
 tl;dr I missed a close friend's birthday party because I was at a different party after I basically forgot that he was doing anything. Is there anything I should be doing right now to right this situation so that our friendship can recover? What would you do to remedy this with someone eight years older?";29;M;FALSE;FALSE
"I (31m) travel frequently for work, trips that last either a few days or can last a few weeks. My fiance and I have gained quite a bit of experience in managing our relationship from a distance over the years, but I won't say that we ever get used to it or that it gets much easier. 
 I can relate to your SO, I'm not too into rehashing the entire day. Chances are I've had an exhausting day and I don't care to exhaust myself further by retelling it to her. So normally, Skype calls in the evening are brief 5-10min catch-up sessions. It's normally once in the early evening as we are settling in, then once before bed. Doesn't really sound like a lot, but we stay in contact most of the day with quick calls and texts. 
 I like to know she is missing me, it just makes me feel better. But If she's too bummed/sad/emotional about it, then it makes me feel shitty like I'm the cause of it. We've had this argument a few times. So normally now we just keep in touch a lot and try to include each other in our day to day activities with brief exchanges. Getting a quick text from her saying she's going for her run and that she loves me can really brighten up my morning. But normally the ""I miss you"" stuff is saved for a skype call in the evening, but isn't dwelled upon. We let each other know we miss each other by including each other in our day, which lets us know we are thinking about each other. (That was a lot of ""each others"" in one sentence) 
 Not sure if any of that helps, just thought I'd share what it's like for us.

"So I (22M) am  6 months into my first real,serious relationship with a girl (22F) I work with. We couldn’t be from more different backgrounds. She has had the roughest upbringing I’ve ever heard. She lives in poverty. I have the silver drawer growing out of my ass, comparatively. Her family poor, moved around all the time. Her father was verbally abusive. She never thrived in school or had a lot of friends. She had a period of good years where she had a surplus of money from her job, was in Crossfit, a dog, a nice low rent apartment, a good car and a boyfriend. Then very rapidly she totalled her car and got into debt with the hospital bills. Dropped out of Crossfit and had to out her beloved dog down. Became addicted to pain meds and got kicked out of her apartment. Lost her boyfriend too. Then I came in. The first time we went out we went back to her place to have sex. She did a line of coke in front of me right beforehand that she had no money for so she was mouthraped in a crack din for it. I should have run then. 
 She calls me the only good thing, the only ray of sunshine in her life now. I got her off cigarettes, coke and booze. She kept getting blackout drunk and driving around. I love her still, but sort of as I would love an injured puppy. I want to take care of her. I can’t fix all her problems, even though I yearn to. I can barely take care of mine. I am unready for a serious relationship until I can provide for myself and one other. And I make less than she does.  At the same time She is fiercely independent and at times will outright refuse my help with anything. She hates to let me pay for anything, urging me to save my money. She refuses to let my father's money help her out either. Sometimes she gets drunk and tries to pressure me to dump her because she is “trash” and is “holding me back”. How I am supposed to dump someone and leave her when I’m the only positive thing around her? I am afraid that if I leave her she will spiral out again and end up on the street. I feel I strong love for this girl and don’t know what to do. 
 
 tl;dr : I don't know exactly what to do. I know I don't want to marry her but I also don't want to leave her alone with her problems.";22;M;TRUE;FALSE
"The Cubs are currently rebuilding but have a promising future. The two cornerstones of the offense are Starlin Castro (24) and Anthony Rizzo (25). 
 Castro SS: .286/13 HR/.764 OPS 
 Rizzo 1B: .278/30 HR/.889 OPS 
 The rest of the Cubs lineup currently consists of Chris Coghlan, Luis Valbuena, Wellington Castillo, Arismendy Alcantara, and Javier Baez. The first three guys mentioned in the last sentence are not expected to be part of the Cubs long-term plans, although they are all 27-29 years old. Their stats are very mediocre and they are merely serving as placeholders for the farm prospects. 
 Baez and Alcantara were brought up from the minors this year. Their stats so far are: 
 Baez 2B: .198/7 HR/.698 OPS (Has been here about a month. Hits bombs but strikes out a ton.) 
 Alcantara CF: .228/5 HR/.659 OPS (Swings at low offspeed pitches, but is hitting .324 in his last 7 games and plays good CF. 
 Baez and Alcantara are young players who have lots to learn but who are expected to be part of the Cubs future plans. 
 Prospects 
 AAA: 
 Kris Bryant 3B (#2 overall pick) : .329/43 HR/1.113 OPS (2018 World Series MVP confirmed) 
 Jorge Soler RF (defected from Cuba, signed 9yr/30M deal in 2012. Called up, will debut tonight): .340/15 HR/1.132 OPS 
 AA: 
 Addison Russell (acquired in Samardzija deal from Oakland): .300/13 HR/.884 OPS 
 Albert Almora: .277/9 HR/.702 OPS

 Billy McKinney (aquired from Oakland in Samardzija deal): .305/1 HR/.845 OPS 
 Pitching 
 Kyle Hendricks (24) was called up this summer. In 8 starts he has posted a 1.78 ERA with a 1.01 WHIP. Jake Arrieta, acuired in the offseason from Baltimore, has also been impressive, posting a 2.53 ERA and 1.01 WHIP in 20 starts. All you need to know about Edwin Jackson is that he is the worst thing about this team. He makes a billion dollars and has an ERA of 6.09. Tsuyoshi Wada (33) was called up recently and has been solid, and Travis Wood, who was traded to the Cubs last year, has been pretty mediocre at best. 
 The Cubs pitching prospects are nothing compared to their hitting ones, but they still have a few promising arms nonetheless. 
 CJ Edwards AA has a 2.17 ERA and 1.01 WHIP in 11 stars with the AZL Cubs and AA. 
 Pierce Johnson AA has a 2.17 ERA and 1.17 WHIP in 18 starts with A Kane County and AA. 
 The Cubs have a very low payroll and will look to sign a big-name pitcher in the near future, such as Jon Lester, David Price, Max Scherzer, or Jonny Cueto. 
 TL;DR: Cubs are starting to bring up their hyped prospects. Offense will be very high-powered. Pitching has been surprisingly good, but Cubs will still look to sign an ace. Playoffs 2017?";30;M;FALSE;FALSE
"My (28M) new girlfriend (25F) is new to orgasming and also to communicating during sex. 
 She is only just learning how to really pleasure herself and struggles to tell me how to touch her because she isnt sure herself. 
 Shes made herself cum with really hard pressure on her clit and super fast side to side motions. I can get her close like this but not over the edge, im used to being soft and gentle with my fingers and tongue and struggle to know how to touch her. 
 Can any girls who like hard stimulation give me some tips/tricks/advice on techniques and things to try. Especially regarding oral because going down on her is my favourite part of sex.

"I [28M] just recently was diagnosed and have begun the process of taking medication [Vyvanse], but I'm finding that my blood circulation has declined. My hands and feet are typically cold, and sometimes my knees are affected too. I realize that's a potential side effect, but I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced this and how you have gone about it. Thank you in advance for your input and help. I can't help but feel that if my circulation is being affected, then I'm technically receiving less blood flow (and therefore oxygen) in my brain, which would cause loss of concentration and all that. 
 I do have a follow-up appointment with my doctor coming up next Monday so I'll obviously consult with him as well, but this subreddit has been invaluable to me thus far so I'd greatly respect your thoughts.

"I PUT [16 M] INSTEAD OF [16 F]. OH DEAR. THE GIRL IS [16 F]. 
 Oh boy. I really fucked up (I think). 
 I have had a crush on this girl since 8th grade and only recently mustered up the courage to ask her out, but the way I framed it, I didn't confirm it was a date, but I didn't deny it was a date. We went 2 days ago and here's a detailed account of what happened. 
 We met up at the theater a half hour early to buy tickets and get popcorn. I decided to be polite and pay for that stuff. There was a long line for both the box office and the concessions, so we talked a lot about our favorite movies and least favorite movies and generally got to know each other better. 
 We go into the theater and we pick seats in the middle of the theater (unimportant, I know) and we sit down in our seats. There's still another 15 minutes before the movie starts, so we joked around and such while we waited for the trailers to start. 
 We were going to a 9:45pm showing, and the movie started at around 9:55pm. 
 At about 10:45-11pm, she lays her head on my shoulder a bit. I (stupidly, looking back) just figured she was tired because it was late. 
 The movie ends at 11:30. We were waiting outside on the sidewalk to get picked up (neither of us drive) so we had more time to talk about the movie, etc. while we waited for our respective older siblings to pick us up. 
 Her older sister pulls up, and she says to me ""I had a really good time tonight. I guess I'll talk to you later."" And before I can get a word out in response she kisses me! 
 Right on the lips! 
 And me, being a kid with thick glasses and a weird face and an endless knowledge of random shit that doesn't matter, was totally caught off guard by this. I kind of just stood there for a minute like ""wait, what the fuck?"", until she giggled and said ""Bye!"" and got into her sister's car. 
 That was 3 days ago and we haven't talked since. I feel like my response was... well, my response was awful. I really don't know what to do now. Do I call her? Do I leave it be for a while? I think it's fairly obvious that I'm new to this whole relationship thing. Guidance is very much needed. 
 
 TL;DR : I went to a movie with a girl, she kissed me, I froze, we haven't talked since.";16;M;FALSE;FALSE
"I (23F) just ended things with a boyfriend (29M) of 9 months because there wasn't enough balance in our relationship. 
 I gave a lot in the beginning because I liked him and he had health issues in the first 2 months of us dating. 
 This developed into me constantly thinking about him/his needs at the expense of my own and him not reciprocating. 
 Few months later, I couldn't break the pattern of give and take and he also I think has issues with being self-absorbed, guilt, and emotional unavailability. 
 In past relationships, I've erased myself because of internal insecurity and because of outside pressure. I don't know how to break this pattern. 
 Please advise. 
 tl;dr: how do I not fall into the pattern of feeling uncared for and express my emotional, intellectual, personal needs in a healthy way and not just as a fall out from fighting";23;F;TRUE;FALSE
"I have been in a relationship with ""Chris"" for two years. It's been perfect in a lot of ways, and rough in others. Chris and I are extremely compatible in our interests, our morals/values, worldview, sexually, and mentally, and in terms of finances, goals, reliability, and maturity. Chris is a very good person who I trust probably more than anyone I've ever met. We love each other, and, I'll say it again, because it's important to me - we're also very compatible sexually. 
 But we've struggled with different energy levels (he has way more than average and literally runs up mountains daily, I have chronic illnesses sapping mine) and different disagreement styles (he wants to have epic 3-5 hour intensely precise logical ""debate tournament"" style disagreements where every point is disputed and devil's advocated, and every inconsistency is picked over with a microscope.) I'm also an extremely logical person but I don't have as much stamina as he does to fight my end as intensely, so I end up sobbing a lot of the time out of pure frustration that he thinks he's ""winning the debate"" because I'm giving up, when I just don't have the energy to keep going. He also holds himself to unbelievably high standards in many areas, and, while he's nowhere near as judgmental about me as he is about himself, he's more judgmental about me than I want him to be. I would say my biggest problem with our relationship is nothing more than being EXHAUSTED by it sometimes. 
 We've talked over all these things a million times. 
 Although we've been together, we've still never lived together. We have decided to live together to decide if we are compatible or not. If we find that we're happy living together, then we might like to move to the next level in our relationship, and possibly get engaged or have a child down the line. We want to see if we'll be compatible living together. 
 As it happens, he has a job opportunity on another continent, in a country where he lived as a child. I'm in a place in life right now where I could make a move like that, so we've decided to do it and see what happens. I've already made a few long-distance moves as an adult, so I'm ok with that aspect of it. 
 So, this is an experiment for us. We've got some things we need to fix, and some thing we need to find out about our compatibility. We'll see how it goes. 
 So this is the flip side of the situation. 
 I am secretly in love with a friend, Danny, who is 20 years old than me. I have been in love with him for several years. I'm NOT going to cheat on Chris with Danny, not physically and not even by being personally or emotionally intimate with Danny. I don't flirt with Danny, tell Danny I love him, or give him extra attention. I don't have communications with him that are private, or that Chris doesn't see. I don't call him my ""best"" friend. I treat him as just an ordinary friend, just another one of my friends. But I am in love with him. 
 Danny and I would not be compatible with each other and even if I were single I would not get in a relationship with him. Danny has a crazy case of commitment-phobia and typically ends relationships after a year or less. The ""realer"" it is, the more he freaks out and runs. 
 Danny grew up with a very loving, but extremely mentally ill parent who he was forced to care for as a child. So, he has a plethora of issues from that which prevent him from being able to have a relationship or fulfill himself in several others ways in life. But the flip side is it made him a really beautiful human being. He's extremely gentle, sweet, sensitive, kind, thoughtful, caring and loving with the humans around him. Whether they're neighbors, friends, people he's having disputes with, or even political opponents in our city. His gentleness is so magnetic to me. 
 I'm in love with him and nobody knows. We don't do any special activities together. We see each other along with our many mutual friends. But the ordinary activities we do together are special to me, because he's there. 
 I do feel like Danny cares about me and loves me as a human being. He's never said or done anything inappropriate or romantic and even if he did I wouldn't allow it. I just feel it. 
 I feel so fucked up about moving far away and leaving Danny, and not seeing Danny anymore. Even though Danny is not someone I would date even if I were single, I would never date him and I know that we aren't compatible for a million reasons. And even though Danny and I don't do anything inappropriate, romantic, or ""special"" and haven't created any kind of secret intimacy between us. 
 I know that some people will think I'm awful for having this feeling, but I don't. I think that while I can control my behavior 100%, feelings don't work the same way. 
 Has anyone else been in this situation? What did you do? How did it turn out? 
 tl;dr : I'm in a good relationship [28f, 32m], and we're about to move far away together. I'm grieving moving away from the person I'm secretly in love with [46m]. Not sure how to cope with that.";28;f;TRUE;FALSE
"So about a year ago, I fell in love for the first time- with an alcoholic [30 M]. 
 His name will be Ted. It was a very one-sided relationship and as much as he said he cared for me and wanted and needed me, (and I believed he did for a long time), it was a very unhealthy relationship. 
I was in love with him when I met this other guy. Let's call him John [24 M]. John and I started hanging out a lot, while I was involved with Ted, and so John quickly became my confidant, or my saviour. Many nights, he picked me up late at night and would comfort me, make me happy, make sure I was feeling alright. Needless to say, John was wonderful to me.
He told me that he was in love with me shortly after we started hanging out. He said he knew he couldn't act on it because I was still involved with Ted. But he needed me to know. 
 Now I guess, I should also say here that I have since apologized many a time to John for using him as I did. And by using him, I mean calling him at 3am, having him drive out and pick me up, then wanting him to hold me and kiss me to make me feel loved. 
 Regardless of how unhealthy my relationship with Ted was, I never felt empty because I was receiving so much love from John. 
 But John wanted me to end things with Ted. He knew that our relationship was unhealthy and he wanted the best for me; he wanted to be with me. John was always my support, and then one night- he snapped. He yelled at me for being involved still with Ted, for crawling back to him every time, for being in love with someone who was so clearly not good for me. He called me names and just lost it. 
He felt horrible after that, but I got very upset. Yes, I selfishly used him- over and over. But I didn't think he would ever do that. 
 So I then don't talk to John for a long time. Things fizzle out with Ted. It takes me a long time to get over him, but eventually I move on and haven't seen him since. Months go by and then casually, John and I start talking again. We hung out once or twice, but nothing more than drinks or coffee. 
 He drops me off one day and I kiss him. He quickly asks me why because he told me he loved me months before and I chose Ted. (John is an overthinker..) I tell John that I simply wanted to kiss him- I enjoyed the time we had spent together, seeing him made me happy and I wanted to kiss him. 
Then we start seeing each other. I don't think it is that serious, as I have never seriously pursued anything with anyone before. But it quickly becomes more serious. 
 We go on a date, where he gets all dressed up and brings me flowers and we talk all about his childhood, and he tells me that I am pulling down his walls and that terrifies him. He tells me things that he says he hasn't told anyone else, but that he feels comfortable with me.
He meets my family, several times, once spending 4 hours with them simply to help my mom put up Christmas lights; I spend just about every night at his place and he drives me home or to work every morning. 
And he tells me over and over how he wants to know me and learn more about my past. He tells me that he wants to date me, to be a big part of my life. 
It has been less than a month, things are going great and I am so happy. 
 And then he ends things. He texts me one day, a couple weeks ago. He says that he isn't ready to be in a relationship. He tells me that he has really tried to pull down his walls, but he is terrified and unprepared to do so. He says he needs to continue to work on himself so he doesn't have another failed relationship. 
(Note: his past 2 relationships ended because of the other party either cheating or leaving him. He has some serious self-esteem issues and insecurities)
John tells me that this has nothing to do with me and that I am amazing. He says I deserve someone who is ready to commit and he is sorry he can't be that guy. 
 I become very upset and ask him if we can talk about it. We do, later at his place. But it was a one-sided conversation where he has made up his mind and wasn't listening to anything I had to say. 
 I told him I would take the relationship label off the table. I said we could work through this together. But he told me that things couldn't work because his feelings for me were ""tainted"" because he fell in love with me when I was involved with Ted and so John locked away his feelings and is unsure if he can ever let them out again. 
He refuses to listen to my pleads to work on us, to work through this, to talk it out, to take things slow; literally anything that means we wouldn't be over. 
 We have a long conversation where he cries, I cry, he yells, I yell, and then we both leave upset. 
 He tells me we both need space, so he can work on himself and I can move on. 
 I guess my confusion here just comes from him doing a 180 flip on me because 4 days before he ended it, he had spent those 4 hours with my family, helping my mom set up Christmas lights and meeting my grandparents. 
 He won't see me anymore, not until the New Year, and has stopped talking to me. And he won't explain where any of it came from other than- ""It just won't work. I can't. I'm sorry"" 
 I've had a couple of really shitty weeks without him- just from him not being in my life, and from other shit that has recently happened in my personal life. He told me he would always be my friend and my support and that he would never leave. But he hasn't been that support that I need, when I need it most. 
 Then why did he leave? 
 TLDR: I was in love and in an unhealthy relationship with a man, when another man became my support and fell in love with me. 
I selfishly used him, and then we had a falling out. 
Reconnected, and started seriously seeing each other. He tells me he wants to be with me, over and over, and that he is loving the time we spend together- all that jazz. Then he ends things. 
Says his feelings for me are tainted because of our history and doesn't think he can ever fall back in love with me. 
Then why make things so serious and bring me so close to him, only to push me away later?";30;M;FALSE;FALSE
"Don't worry about endurance right now. Technique is most important! 
I did some high school and club swimming, I was always the last one in my lane. I would stop to get some rest in the middle of a set (mainly in the beginning of the season) but when it came to a swim meet, I was able to get very decent times. (50yr Free - 24.05 sec, 100yr breast - 1:09 min, freshman yr) Many of my swim mates would not understand how I was terrible during practice and never finished the 5 mile runs on Sundays, some even said I was wasting my ""talent""! Well, I understood the technique and made sure to keep a tight core during practice. 
Watch some technique videos: (  ) look how the kick is flawless and Alexander's legs seem made out of rubber! 
With great technique your endurance will improve drastically and you will become a much faster swimmer. 
By my senior year I swam a 50m long course in 24.90 sec , 50 yr short course 21.6 sec. Dropped my 100 yr breastroke to a 1:01 and was able to swim the 500 yr in 5:05 min (I hate long distance!). I was still struggling to finish the Sunday runs, but I never forgot my technique when it came down to it. Work hard during practice, but focus on technique not being the first to finish the set. And of course this applies to ALL strokes, with time you will find you niche and while you may like fly you could develop some serious talent in a different stroke overtime.

 I was recently diagnosed with stage 2 lymphoma. The cancer is pretty localized and hasn't spread below my neck, which is great news. I start chemotherapy this week. I'll only need 4 months of chemo. James and I talked about it, and he said that he wants to continue dating me, and he'd be right by my side for every step of the way. I think the hardest part so far has been attending to the emotional reactions of my loved ones. James has been the exception. He's been thoughtful and kind, and I haven't felt like I've needed to take care of him at all. 
 We'd been treating this weekend as sort of a ""last hurrah"" before chemo. My parents gave us money to go up to the city and have a nice dinner. I bought a cocktail dress, my sister took me to Sephora to get my makeup done, and my mom lent me a pair of gorgeous diamond earrings. I even got my hair done. James and I have been talking about this for weeks. He asked for my advice on what suit and cologne I'd like him to wear. He offered to pay for a hotel. It was all very sweet and it was fun to plan it all. 
 We originally planned to leave at three, but Sephora took more time than I was expecting. I texted him at 2:40 asking to push it till four, and he said that was totally fine. He said he was all ready, and would just play video games until I was ready to pick him up. (He doesn't drive) 
 I get to his door at 4 and his dog immediately jumps on me. I get the dog off, and she tore a hole in my nylons, but the dress covers it so that's okay. He comes out in jeans and a hoodie. I thought maybe he just hasn't gotten ready yet. He says that I look gorgeous, and that he's going to be a little underdressed because his dress shirt shrunk in the wash. I think I said something like ""oh no!"" And then he asked if I could drive him to the store, because his dad's house is out of toilet paper and he forgot to buy more. I said okay, and sat in the parking lot while he shopped. I felt stupid, overdressed and very sad. I had no idea what to say. Retrospectively, I should have asked him to buy a new shirt at the store. Or asked him to borrow one of his dad's while we were there. 
 When he gets back in the car, I realize that he's under the dress code for the restaurant we have reservations to. I decided to drive back to my apartment and change into jeans. I felt like the 5 year old whose parents let her wear her princess dress to the grocery store because she thinks it looks good. 
 He was going to look up the train schedule and didn't, so I looked up the times and started driving us to the nearest station. He insisted we go to another station because it would be less crowded, and when I got on the freeway, I realized that the station he was directing me to was about 40 miles away vs. the 8 miles I was originally planning on driving. At this point, I was far enough that driving back would have been dumb. We get there and buy our tickets, and he finds our train and we run to catch it. Two stops in I look at the map and realize we're on the wrong train. He's playing a game on his phone and insists that its the right train. It's not. By the time it's all figured out and we're back on track, our night has been set back another 45 min. I'm livid, but determined to have a nice evening, so I don't say anything. 
 We get to the city, and we've picked another restaurant. He starts to direct us from the station and I pull out my phone to find it. He says ""you don't trust me?"" and I briefly consider abandoning him in the city. I order whiskey with my dinner. A lot of whiskey. So I'm feeling tipsy and much more agreeable. 
 We hold hands at dinner and he starts to talk about chemo. I tell him I don't want to talk about it, and he says that I have to start talking about it sometime, and ignoring it won't make it go away. I say fine, we get the check and walk around the city. I'm feeling disappointed and upset, but I also feel like the time to talk about how sad he made me has passed, because it's not like he can fix it now. We sit on a bench and he tells me that my hair looks so beautiful curled like that. I'm vulnerable and inebriated, and I break down and cry, which is a pretty rare occurrence. He holds me for a few minutes and tells me that he could see the worry in my face all night, and that everything would be okay. 
 I posted to reddit because I feel like my emotions are compromised and I'm not looking at this logically. I thought he knew how important this night was to me, but we've only been together for four months, so maybe my expectations were unfair. I don't know what to do next. 
 TL;DR. I have cancer, and it sucks. I think my boyfriend may have just proved that he's not someone I can depend on.";22;F;TRUE;FALSE
"The other day was the 2-year dating anniversary for me (26F,HL) and my boyfriend (31M,LL) and it really made me realize how upsetting our relationship is to me. 
 See, even before we started dating, we were having sex all the time. I was cheating on my ridiculously abusive boyfriend/fiancee, who I then moved out of state with for two years, basically breaking my now-bf's heart. But we broke up, I moved back home, and we've been dating ever since. I knew from the beginning that he had chronic, untreated depression, but back in the day, he was trying to improve himself. Working out, trying to gain weight, etc., and he was an overall happy and loving person. He wanted to hold my hand and kiss me all the time, our sex was creative, we loved each other from the start. 
 When we started officially dating, things had changed, which was to be expected. He was in school full-time, and therefore more busy than he ever had been before. But we still had frequent, if less creative, sex. We enjoyed being around each other and had a great 1st anniversary. Then last fall we moved in together, with a roommate, and everything has gone downhill from there. 
 First, he does NOTHING around the house. Yesterday was the first time in the 10 months we've been living here that he washed dishes he wasn't going to be immediately using. He vacuumed for the first time last week. He leaves his dirty clothes all over the area we live on. He's aware that it's not okay either; I've told him that I need him to help more, that he feels like a shitty roommate, etc., and he's told our friends (when hanging out as a group) that yes, he really needs to be helping out more. Too bad it rarely happens, and only after I make a comment like, ""well, start doing it rather than just talking about it."" 
 Second, our sex life is pretty much gone. I always had the higher desire between the two of us, but now his desire (at least for me) has vanished. We've had sex once a month and only once a month for all of 2016. The intimacy is gone as well. He shows no interest in my day, cuts me off when I'm trying to tell a story, he doesn't kiss me or hug me or hold my hand, and he gets annoyed when I touch him. The closest we get to real physical contact is when he's bugging me in what he thinks is a playful way: patting my butt, tickling me, poking me. It used to be cute, but as I know it's not going to lead to anything, it's just obnoxious now. 
 Third, he's got a porn addiction. I know he'd object to calling it that, but I feel like when you're having sex with your willing partner once a month but looking at porn daily, it's a problem. As soon as I go to bed, he's trolling Reddit for porn. When he gets home from work, he locks himself in our bedroom to ""relax"" or ""nap,"" and afterwards I find wet spots on the sheet. I know what he's into, and I always have, and it's not a look I can obtain temporarily or without shelling out a lot of money. Now, I support watching porn, even when in a relationship. My ex and I used to watch porn together and fool around. But I feel like that'd be off the table for my current man, and I really think it would just make me self-conscious since there is a very specific ""type"" he's into, rather than just into porn in general. Given my generally low self-esteem and my history of disordered eating behaviors, this is really hitting me hard. 
 Lastly, we get to the other day, our 2 year anniversary. He had to work all morning and had class all night, while it was my day off, but whatever, we don't control our schedules. So while he's at work, I run my errands and go to the mall to get him an anniversary present. I picked out a Lego set he'd been drooling over for months, but he can never justify spending money on himself. So I did! I left it on his desk chair upstairs and greeted him when he got home from work. I told him he had something waiting for him upstairs, assured him it wasn't anything bad, and he went upstairs. Then he came back down to use the bathroom, saying nothing to me, then returned upstairs. A long while later he comes and sits in the living room with me (though not next to me on the couch) and watches TV with me. Eventually he notices that I'm upset and asks me what's wrong. 
 ""Did you see the thing?""
""Yeah. But I feel bad because I didn't get you anything (he's literally never gotten me anything, not for birthdays, anniversarys, Christmas, etc. NEVER) and because I'm bad at getting presents.""
Long pause, then I say, ""Well you could say 'thank you.'""
""Thanks."" 
 He did skip out of class early to hang out with me and our friends at a local bar, but once again, even on our anniversary, I went to bed alone and without romance, intimacy, or sex. I'm a very lovey-dovey person, and he acts like it pains him to touch me. He always has some excuse (libido goes down in winter, too hot in summer, tired, needs time alone) even though he gets like 22 hours apart from me a day, and then in our last fight he had the nerve to say I wasn't ""supportive"" enough. 
 I feel like I'm just rambling at this point, so I'll wrap it up. I just really needed a place to vent.

"I live with my girlfriend [27f] and I'm realizing that after 7 years together we share all the same friends (mostly female). The guys who are in our circle are kinda shitty and I have a hard time hanging out with them. They cancel plans with me unless the girls are there and so on... Not to mention we have almost nothing in common. I feel weird saying it, but I'm having a hard time making friends. I work from home and the things I'm into tend to be kind of geeky. I've found many guys who I meet who are into the same things as me are anti social and couldn't mix with my girl and our other friends. 
 It feels weird posting this because it sounds silly but I'm starting to get really lonely. Online gaming and virtual friends aren't enough to survive on.

"Purchased my first gun a few months back at a local gun show. It's a Beretta 92F that I just found out was a whole lot older than I thought. This was made in 1989 and is still in great shape, save for a few scratches.

 I've always loved the Beretta, and I saw this for a steal. Looking around the gun show, I saw tons of others that were the same price but were in terrible shape. (Probably old police issue)

 I also have an Ithica lever-action (breach loading) 12ga that was passed down from my dad that I use for quail. Now that I've been bitten by the bug, I'm looking for a rifle. Possibly a 30-06, .308, or 7.62.

"So my SO ""ben"" and I are having some issues right now with a few coworkers. I've been with my SO for over two and a half years, we've lived together for one year in our college town, a few hours away from our home town. 
 We applied to work at the same store, but the manager told us she would not hire us if we were dating, so we decided to keep it on the down low. At this job we met a guy ""Jordan"" [20M]. Jordan shared many similar interests and seemed like a nice guy, so we started seeing him outside of work. However, he began trying to drive a wedge between my bf and I and openly admitted to my bf that it was because he liked me. He tries to put my bf down by calling him names and generally trying to act better than him. He also condemns my bf and tries to get me to see that ""he's just childish and not ready to be an adult"" which isn't true. Jordan also made several attempts to share pornography with Ben, as we were all sitting in the couch, to which ben kindly asked he stopped and he didn't. He also had to make perverted comments about every girl that went near him. 
 As a result ben and I decided to cut contact but remain friendly as he was still our coworker. Jordan took it upon himself to tell a few people about me and my SO and to spread a few more lies, he's made me cry more times than I've hung out with him which upset my SO. Recently Jordan got fired, because many girls went to management about his perverted behaviour. 
 My SO and I have four supervisors who rotate watching over the department. Josh [29M] and Andy [26M]. Andy has a wild past, and has now found a gf he loves and would like to settle down with him. Josh is dating Andy's ex gf who has cheated on all of her bfs and is a generally poisonous person to be around. Andy has recently begun hanging out with me and my SO upon finding out about relationship. We love Andy and he's a really great guy, he and his gf come over to play games and we go on double dates and such. Andy and my SO had a bromance from the start. 
 Recently our other supervisor josh has started hanging out with Jordan. Josh and Andy aren't huge fans of each other having shared a gf. Josh began hanging out with Jordan since Jordan got fired and they as well have hit it off in a bromance. 
 Last night I go into work and josh is there waiting for me. He asks to speak to me and reveals that Jordan has informed him of my relationship. I say OK no problem. Over my shift josh begins opening up to me and telling me details of his life. I called my SO to tell him that Jordan has told people that were dating. Due to our history with Jordan, we saw this as a malicious attempt to have us fired as well, which would not be out of character for him. So it was the straw that broke the camels back and my SO proceeded to say a few choice words to Jordan. Jordan got hostile and started calling my SO names. I should add that Jordan is a very selfish and narcissistic person, which we learned about the hard way. He believes his beliefs and life is superior to our despite the fact that were engaged, have an apartment, and are second year university students, he is superior because he drinks scotch, has 3000 debt and goes clubbing apparently. 
 I didn't know about these events and agreed to get coffee after my shift with with my SO, josh, and Josh's SO and a couple other people. After finishing coffee, Jordan got wind of who josh was with and got upset with josh ""for telling me that it was Jordan who told him about the relationship"" so I'm thinking we'll maybe you shouldn't be blabbing secrets that aren't yours to blab. So to diffuse the situation I tell my SO to apologize, so he does. Then josh tells him he needs to go call Jordan, so he does to appease josh, but Jordan ignores both calls and shut his phone off. I saw this is rather childish ironically. 
 Josh drove us home and was freaking out the whole time and making threats to make our lives at work horrible if we ruined his friendship. Jordan then messages josh that he's not mad at him and will talk about it in the morning. I didn't feel this was an issue that needed to be dragged out. My SO said sorry, Jordan should accept it and move on seeing as we never planned to hang out with him again anyway. 
 That night I called Andy to tell him of the nights happenings and he agreed that although (and my SO knows this) my SO acted rash because he thought his job was in danger, he came around and apologized which should be good enough. Josh wanted my SO to apologized at least four times and for me to apologize on his behalf as well. I think that's a little over the top for someone who has tries to split us up since day one and admits to it. My SO knew he shouldn't have but he based his actions on Jordan's past behaviour, then realised he should not have done it and apologized. Andy said my SO did all he could in apologising and we should not apologize again. 
 My SO decides he would not be apologising again, but if Jordan calls him or sees him in person on the streets he would apologize again out of courtesy. Andy also told us we should distance ourselves from josh and his crowd, because he was one of them once and know they are very toxic. Which I can tell because we hung out with them for 20 minutes and look what happens. 
 I'm just not sure how to proceed with this situation, Andy has become very close to us and as our superior at work will try to protect us as much as possible, but I feel like Jordan is being very immature about a situation and neither me or my SO want to feed into that drama. My SO simply wanted him to know we were done with him because of his own actions. Are we doing to the right things here?? How do we go about salvaging this enough for everyone to calm down? 
 Tl;Dr my SO and I are having trouble with coworkers, one is threatening to ruin our work experience if his friendship fails after my SO told off this mutual friend, mutual friend is acting very dramatic and has stopped talking to many people just for having coffee with my so and i and we both want nothing to do with this situation.";20;M;FALSE;FALSE
"My girlfriend, Emily and I have only been together about 5 months, been having mind blowing sex for 2 of those months. My problem is she leaves the bed immediately after we have sex. And I mean IMMEDIATELY after. No cuddling, no pat on the back, nothing. At this point, I would happily take a high five. She simply rolls off and hits the shower, and then she’s off doing a million things I wish would wait until a more appropriate time. It makes me feel like shit. 
 I should mention that she either has insomnia or weird sleep habits. She only sleeps about four hours a night so while I’m ready to hit the sack; her night is nowhere close to over. Usually she stays up till 2/3am watching TV, lots of documentaries while she Skype's with her best friend (27f in a different country), Whatsapp, reading, doing her nails, video games, yoga... She ends up crashing on the couch. I'm trying and failing to be cool with it since it hasn't affected her life or her job as far as I can tell. She's up at 7am every single day. 
 My last relationship (Claire, 6 years) ended badly. Nobody cheated but it got very ugly at the end. She accused me of being needy, clingy, spineless, less than a man, blah blah you get the gist. I admit that I became really codependent in that relationship and I’m worried about being that person with this new girl. So I’m constantly torn between asking for what I want and giving her space. I am crazy about her and I absolutely do not want to break up over this. How do I bring this up to her without becoming overly emotional, paranoid or taking this to ultimatum territory?

"So I have this ex, from a few years ago. We dated for about 2 years, ending 4ish years ago. We ended on...neutral-to-bad terms. We were both career driven, she wasn't comfortable with my living situation, didn't like my dog, etc, etc. 
 I've since been married (and am mid-divorce) and I woke up to an email a few days ago saying ""26F is now following you on Pinterest!"". Now, I don't use the site much, but I have an account. It piqued my curiosity, and it turns out she unblocked me from a lot of other social networkin sites - facebook, linkedin, etc. 
 I've always told people that I bear her no ill will - we are just not meant to be together. I like to joke she's one of the few ""winners"" I've dated, and she's showing it - last I heard, nice job as an analyst of some sort in D.C. I'm just finishing up my Ph.D. - I think academia and our goals afterwards kind of got in the way of ""us"". 
 Anyway, my question is this - there are two possible reasons I would have gotten that email - A), she imported her contacts list and it auto-followed me. Not likely, since I browsed her profile and she's been a member for 3ish years. B), she's sending out some feelers, and maybe wants to re-establish contact, and using Pinterest instead of re-adding me on facebook gives her the plausible deniability of something like A)? 
 Anyway, I've been sitting on this a few days, and I want to know what reddit thinks I should do. I've dated a few girls in my time, and being older and wiser now, I wish I hadn't dated her - but out of all of them, she's the one I wish had truly ended with the stereotypical ""we'll be friends"". I still remember her phone number (assuming she hasn't changed it). Do I reach out? Do I let the suspense kill me? I don't even know!

 So here's what happened: I texted her. The transcript follows. 
 Me: Hey 9:08 PM 
 Her: Nate? 9:08 PM 
 Me: Ha. No you added me on pinterest so I thought I'd say ""hi"" on the off chance it wasn't an auto add from importing your Gmail contacts or something. 9:10 PM 
 Her: Who is this? 9:14 PM 
 Me: /u/duodan. And if I misjudged (or misremembered this number), then no harm, no foul. Have a good night! 9:15 PM

"How do I confront her? 
 The long story: 
My girlfriend and I life together for half an year. Because of my work, I always life three month with her and then three months in a city around 200 miles away from her. We are currently living together. 
 I know that the maestro of her orchestra (~55M) had been making photos of her prior to our relationship, which she shew to me. She was dressed on all of them. 
 Today I occasionally found some nudes of my girlfriend in our apartment. The order date suggest that these have been made around one week after I moved once again away for three months in February. They have been in the same place as the old photos from her, so I conclude the photograph is the same. 
 Here is one more complicating aspect: My girlfriend has been raped when she was 12 until she was 17. She won't tell me who it was, because I ""shall be able to look him into the eyes when I meet him"" and he ""is a nice guy normally"". But she said he was a lot older than her. While she is a lot better than before, she has still some panic attacks at night. 
 What makes this interesting is that I always thought she looked scared on the pictures he made of her. Thus I always wondered if he is the one who assaulted her and forced her to be his model. She doesn't looked as much frightened on the new ones, and she still is going to diner with him once a while (I don't know what to think of that). 
 She is coming home tomorrow and I do want to confront her. She is the type of person that will tell me the truth, but I am not sure how to deal with the possible outcomes. Please give me some suggestions how to discuss the topic with her? 
 Thanks 
 Edit: Would I be right to demand no-contact to her maestro? That would mean she had to give up her orchestra which means a lot to her.

 Fast forward a couple of days to today: my friend (20 F) looked at her Facebook (I don't use FB anymore; we normally chat using Hangouts) and told me she was in Malaysia and had posted a bunch of pictures to Facebook and whatnot. I feel really disrespected because she obviously had lots of time to use Facebook but apparently didn't have 3 minutes to tell me where she was.

We were each other's best friends and were with each other every day. I was close with her family and she was close with mine. We broke up because I had an addiction to porn that she wasn't comfortable with. I became depressed, unmotivated, and took the relationship for granted. 
 So she wound up dating a new guy almost right after we broke up. I was heartbroken to see the only girl I loved with a new guy so fast after a break up. I was crushed. So she's been with him for 4 months now and it seems like they are out having a good time all the time because of the shit she posts on instagram. 
 I went and apologized to her father last week face to face for hurting his daughter. I told him if I have a daughter some day that I don't want to see her hurt. 
 A week after that she randomly calls me out of the blue. She thanks me and says it was a ""manly"" thing to do to go and speak to her father. She then starts talking about how I'm doing and tells me she drives by my house frequently. When I brought up anything about how her and her new man were doing she quickly changed the topic or seem uninterested in talking about it. I told her how hard it is to live with regret and seeing someone you love love somebody else. She sounded like she wanted to see I know how you feel but hesitated and held back. She really sounded genuinely interested in me and we had a real good conversation. My battery almost died so I told her id call he later and she said she would call me tomorrow not from her phone. I'm thinking maybe her new boyfriend is one of those control freaks that checks her phone. 
 Anyway. What do any of you think of this? My gut tells me she misses me. She told me that she thinks about me a lot. I don't know what to make of all this. Do I play it cool if she doesn't call me back? I know I shouldn't act desperate which I am not. I do still love the girl. We have this emotional and sexual attraction I can't explain

"My best friend [17m] seems to be having girlfriend [16f] troubles. They've been together for almost a year (their anniversary is at the end of May), but seem to have no intimacy whatsoever. 
 It's my friend's first relationship with a girl he met through school. A year apart, went on a couple of movie dates, then he asked her out. Yay for him, right? 
 They seemed to be going okay at first, like they took it slow and maybe held hands a little. He'd message me telling me about all the fun they'd had just spending time together doing whatever they ended up doing. 
 By the time they were together for 4 months, he seemed to get a little frustrated at her lack of intimacy. He's the kind of guy that would just love to sit there with his arm around you, but she seemed to be against it completely, to the point where she'd just push him away. 
 At this point, I tended to just tell him it would be okay over time. I presumed that maybe she was just a little nervous, or just that she wasn't used to anything physical within a relationship. 
 They had their first kiss 8 months in to the relationship. He seemed aggravated that it took so long, yet relieved that it had finally occurred. I was happy for them both, believing that maybe that bit of awkwardness had worn away now. 
 However, I think I judged wrongly. In the 4-ish months since this, they seem to have slightly grown apart. She rarely plans to meet him, and when they do they tend to either get bored or annoyed at each other. He tries to cuddle her while she refuses to let him. 
 My friend is rather upset about it all. He feels that he loves her, that he wants to spend the time with her and get to know her, but she's never wanting to. He blames himself, claiming that his initial awkwardness is to blame for their current lack of physical affection. 
 Now, I don't know what to say to help him. I've never spoken to his girlfriend, so I've never been able to mention it briefly to her. I tend to tell him that it'll all be okay, but that it's going to take time to figure it all out. 
 I mean I understand that he's only 17 and has his whole life ahead of him to find another girl, and I've said this, but he's all hung up on her. First relationships are always a pain, I guess. 
 TL;DR; I need help helping my friend in his relationship problems. Should I reassure him? Tell him to grow up and get over it? Any advice would be great.";17;m;FALSE;FALSE
"Hey Reddit, 
 Me [19M], my girlfriend [18F], have been dating almost two months LDR. This whole relationship has been a LDR. She's about an hour and half away from me. Everything has been great since yesterday, I may just be over analyzing the situation, but I need some your advice. 
 My gf is out of town right now with her cousins, chilling on thanksgiving break. We text pretty much all day from good morning till good night and even some fb chat during the day and maybe a phone call once a week. Lately, I've been have feeling that my gf may be losing interesting in me just based on her text message responses. She'll take a while to respond to me (I understand its thankgiving and she's enjoying it with her family) but that's usually not like her and most of her texts are short sometimes. I feel like I've been keeping the conversations going for the most part. She'll make an excuse up to why shes short. She's also not very intimate as I am and that makes me feel sometimes we're not even bf/gf. I feel like sometimes she doesn't even care about our relationship. 
 I think a part of it has to do with my insecurity, my last ""girl"" ditched me for her ex about 3 months into the relationship. My current gf broke up with her ex in may but the last time they had sex was july. He's a complete douchebag that hit her and everything but they dated for 4 years and I just feel like she'll lose interest in me and move on. I'm afraid that I'm more emotionally invested into this relationship than her. I understand its only two months but I really really like this girl and I don't know what to do. 
 This is my first ever post on reddit, I've lurked this subreddit before and noticed the great advice you guys give out, I just hope you guys can do that same for me. I just don't know where to go. Am I just over-analyzing everything and need to calm down?

 I am 100% sure I am doing something wrong, I feel like I am doing aerials in too safe approach (too slow boost-stop-boost-stop) and I go for aerial only when I am 100% confident I'll hit the ball then I don't hit the most easiest ball in the world.

On the other hand, when I've roomed with girls for volleyball trips, I've always found it annoying because they keep talking and bitching all the time lol.

"I am a 22F who's just graduating from college. I spent the last four years living at home and dating an abusive piece of shit who broke up with me (thank god) at the beginning of the year. I just started a new full-time job and I'm already anxious about not making friends there either. 
 I went to therapy after my breakup and since then I've realized that my relationship really suffocated and alienated me. My ex (24M) isolated me from my friends, used jealousy to control who I could see, talked shit about my friends and family and tried to turn me against them and I gradually become more lonely as our 4 years together dragged out. It was very toxic and therapy has helped me see this, but I don't know how to cope as I'm unable to see my wonderful therapist anymore because of my new full-time job. 
 My ex also had no friends, and constantly complained about it and I feel like he dragged me down with him. I feel terrible. I drifted away from the very few friends I did make in university, as they all made new friend groups of their own and now we rarely see each other or talk. 
 On the surface, it may look like I have friends to those who don't really know me, considering people interact with me on social media platforms through likes and comments... But beyond that, I get the occasional catch up text from friends but we never see each other. 
 I have this feeling that no one likes me, and I never want to bother anyone so it's really hard for me to initiate hanging out with people due to previous experiences. At my last job, I invited two of my co-workers out to sushi when they mentioned loving it, and they completely ignored me and then went together. 
 More than anything, I find it extremely difficult to befriend girls. I've met two girls in my program at school that I had major girl-friend crushes on, but they never made an effort to hang out outside of school. I tried, but they just seemed so uninterested even though we seemingly had a lot in common and got along great. One of them took my number and never texted me. 
 I have befriended guys in the past and we got along and I actually had a social life for a bit, but my ex made me stop talking to them and made me feel like all men are out to use me for sex, that they don't just want to be friends. This made me feel like I'm not worth being friends with as a person. 
 There are so many issues and I feel EXTREMELY insecure about my lack of friends. I'm currently dating a wonderful, sweet guy (26M) who treats me like gold. He has a very active social life and wonderful friends that clearly love and care about him. I've met them a few times now and I can't believe how great they are, but I also can't help but feel anxious and sad, because I've never had friends like that and it's like they're the type of people I've always wanted as friends. 
 To put things in perspective, I made 2 close friends in middle school that I still keep in touch with. One of them lives 10 hours away but we text often and we visit each other when we can. I consider her my best friend, but I never see her so I'm always alone. My other friend, who I also consider my best friend, is on/off and she goes MIA a lot. I haven't seen her in over a year and she's very unpredictable/unstable. I love her but I also feel unappreciated by her sometimes. I invited her to my graduation and I haven't heard from her in 2 weeks. Safe to say she's not coming. 
 That's pretty much it. I have a couple of other online friends that I talk to regularly but again, they live far away and we never hang out. 
 I just feel so isolated and it's gotten to the point where I only leave the house for work, errands, with my mom or to see my new boyfriend. There are so many cool events going on around the city that I feel like I can't attend because of my lack of friends, and to make matters worse I know for a fact that people I'm acquainted with are attending those events (through FB) so I feel even more awkward going alone, since they'll see me by myself and wonder why I'm ALWAYS alone (this has actually happened before, someone I thought I was friends with asked me: ""How come you always come alone?"" and it made me feel extremely insecure.

"I [22F] saw a guy [22M] I knew in high school last weekend. We and all of our friends were drunk. After lots of talking and hours of hanging out, we ended up making out and sleeping in the same bed. I was worried that he would not feel the same way in the morning, but things were fine and dandy. We text each other a couple times a day and have talked on the phone twice (he lives an hour away so we haven't seen each other). We both decided it was unfair to let one drunken night declare how we felt, but we should get to know each other better. So, things have been going pretty well. But he has an ex that is still in the picture. I have asked about her but he brushes it off and says it's not anything to worry about and that their relationship is stale. I say ok, but still keep a little distance about that subject. He said he was going out of town this weekend and names all of the friends he's going with. Haven't talked to him because I'm trying to give him his space (super hard because I'm super impatient). Saw on Facebook that he was tagged somewhere and in a picture with the ex. Am I validated in being a little mad that he didn't mention that she would be there? I'm just kind of upset with myself for being 1. impatient 2. selfish and 3. crushing too hard too soon.

 I am interested in a girl (19F) that went with my attractive female friend (19F, we have been friends for about 2 years. No sex, just friends) and I to a country club on saturday. We danced together and had a good time, but she had to leave early. She is friends with my attractive female friend and I am asking my friend to take her to lunch or dinner or Starbucks or whatever to sort of probe her for her interest in me, as I do not have her phone number myself. 
 This, however, seems to be extremely difficult to arrange between them and I honestly don't expect it to happen anytime soon. I don't like this situation I have where I can't talk to her myself, but I feel like if I found her on facebook or hit her up on twitter it would be 'creepy' or 'too much too fast.' 
 I am torn on what to do. If I let my friend suggest that we get together, then I have the friend's seal of approval and she might trust me more or be more eager to see me, but I am impatient and if I find her online I risk coming off as creepy.

Our relationships with each others' families are very healthy and our friends are all cool (those here in the bay that is).

"So, about a month ago I (35F) was prescribed a medication by my doctor for a heart condition I was having. During the same time my doctor prescribed an anti-depressant as well because I had had a rough summer and was exhibiting some signs of depression. No big deal. I did not mention this to my SO (33M, 6 mo) because it just didn't seem that important; I figured I'd take the medicine for awhile and get better. 
 I started developing some anxiety. Slowly at first with symptoms like not sleeping well, shakiness, sweating. Over the course of a couple weeks it increased to the point that I was becoming worrisome constantly and eventually throwing up from the anxiety. I was having feelings of insecurity, fear of abandonment, loneliness (which are highly unlike me - people know me to be confident, outgoing, secure, etc). I was holding things down ok, though, and figured it was just from the stress I was dealing with and it would pass. 
 Then by SO and I were at an event with our group of friends, including my closest female friend. At this party she told me that she was uncomfortable with the way I had been acting and was not sure she could continue being friends with me. Because I was so sensitive because of the anxiety, this put me over the edge. The next interaction I had with my SO I completely misinterpreted because of my fragile state and I went off the deep end. Not yelling, but being accusatory, short, rude, generally not cool and at one point I even tried to hit him (never something I would normally do) I was that crazy girlfriend that nobody wants to deal with. We got in a huge blow out argument at home and he told me he wanted me out of his life. 
 I immediately went to the hospital because I knew there was something wrong- this behavior was not like me AT ALL. I was treated there, my heart monitored and put on different medications. I'm pretty much back to myself now (I left the hospital a week ago). 
 It's only since changing the medication that I can, in retrospect, understand what was happening. I feel absolutely horrible about my behavior, but I didn't realize at the time the effects of the meds or the intensity of the anxiety. I don't expect him to not be angry about what happened, but if he understood the circumstances, he might be more forgiving. However, he feels that my behavior was so inexcusable that he won't even let me give him an explanation (which, honestly, I think is kind of understandable given the way I acted). I even sent him a message that he refuses to read. 
 The situation is driving me nuts. I feel guilty, sad that we haven't spoken, but also angry that he won't at least hear me out. What's your advice?

 Now that summer is here we have to live with long distance, living about 6 hours from each other. I start working full time at an internship next week, and she will be doing the same at her home, plus working weekends at a second job.

 I'm constantly debating ending the relationship because I get so upset over these thing. I really like this guy, he's so solid and says just the right things to calm me down. But every time he cancels or says no when I ask him to hang out, I start wondering if he even wants to be with me. 
 Does anyone have any suggestions to how I can calm down and be less needy and over reactive?

"I'm pretty sure I'm in an abusive relationship but I don't know what to do. I [30F] have been in a relationship with my husband [31M] for 15 years and have been married for 2 years. We have a 7 mo old son. I am too ashamed of myself for putting myself in this situation to talk with anyone so my apologies if it's a bit long; this is definitely me venting. 
 My husband has issues with anger management and depression. He has always been quick to anger but after the death of his father 7 years ago he has gotten increasingly depressed and anti-social. I am a fairly patient person and in the past I have been able to deal with these issues and ""take care of him"" but now that we have a baby, my husband is no longer the centre my attention and things have gotten really bad. 
 On a daily basis I am told that am lazy, stupid and incompetent. I am not allowed to defend myself because whether my excuse is valid or not he just doesn't want to hear it. He has a terrible time maintaining relationships and has pretty much cut his entire family out of his life. He also hates my family because he feels they don't show him enough respect. He wants me to cut them out of my life as well though I have refused. 
 I can't talk to him about any serious issues because his response is to get angry and either to storm out of the room or tear me apart so I'm reduced to a snivelling mess that can barely form a coherent sentence. The only tactic which does not result in anger is to keep my mouth shut except to agree with whatever he's saying. He also expects me to be constantly paying attention to him because if he speaks and I'm not listening, he gets angry. Sometimes I am paying attention to him but I can't make out what he said (he needs to speak up or annunciate better) and he gets really angry saying I don't listen. He hates repeating himself so I try to piece together the gist of the sentence based on the words I did hear but I  often get this wrong too and he gets really angry. He doesn't hit me but he does say things like ""you deserve to be hit/beaten for that"". 
 He either has amazing hearing or is paranoid. I can't confirm or refute a lot of what he thinks but here are some examples: he thinks the upstairs tenant is listening to all our conversations and occasionally follows him from room to room; he thinks the neighbors in the next block are yelling at him and occasionally drive by our house to watch us; he thinks the construction workers behind my parents house must be friends with our neighbors because they are yelling obscenities at him; he thinks our neighbors are trying to look in our windows and are making fun of mundane details of our life (laundry not done, etc.). While we do not have a good relationship with these neighbors but I sometimes wonder how much of this is true. 
 I know the reason why we have lasted so long is because I am so meek and have generally gone along with whatever he wanted. I have also played the role as his therapist since he refuses to seek any sort of counseling. I know he needs help but he's a grown man and a father and needs to be able to take care of himself. Most days he barely even eats a meal unless I make it for him. 
 The thing that is stopping me from heading straight out the door is his obvious love for our son. When they are together I see my old husband I fell in love with before all the anger and depression took hold. I would feel terrible separating them. I am also worried about the effects a divorce would have on our son. Many of the anger and trust issues I see in my husband I can identify as being the result of a bad divorce between his parents when he was very young. Lastly I did vow to stay with him through sickness and health. I don't take that lightly especially since these problems seem to be the result of a mental health issue and are not representative of the husband I fell in love with so many years ago.
I am also the only source of income at this time so to separate would be essentially kicking him out on the street. I can't afford to support him if we had a divorce and had to make an income disparity payment. We've both graduated college but while I got a job in my field immediately after graduating, he never even submitted a resume for fear of being rejected. He was offered tutoring work but that has petered off and he currently has no work. He has gotten a menial job since graduation but got in a fight with the management and quit. I recognize my husband's actions as a cry for help from a lonely, depressed man but I don't know how to help him. 
 I cry almost every day and I don't feel any love for him anymore. I do my best to stay under his radar and keep things relatively civil for our son. Some days are better than others. I am trying my best not to debase myself to his level and only treat him the way I want him to treat me but sometimes my anger and resentment break through. 
 If he were to verbally attack my son the way he attacks me I would most certainly leave. If he were to physically harm me I would leave and if he would verbally attack my sister to ""reduce her to a sniveling mess"" as he dearly wants to do I would likely leave him as well. Really what I want is to save our relationship and keep our family together but it I don't know how to do that. Please Reddit, if you have any advice I really need it. 
 TL;DR Husband's mental health issues are causing him to be increasingly abusive. Moral, financial and family reasons are making it difficult for me to just leave. 
 Edit:  I have decide I need to reframe my thresholds. If  I have one more ""bad"" day I'm leaving. I intend to talk to a lawyer and prepare a suitcase in case I need to skedaddle. I can talk to my mom about staying at my parents house during the transition. I also have a good friend who has schizophrenia and it's ironic because he is a model dad with a good relationship with his wife. I intend to talk with him and the wife about addressing his mental health situation. Maybe hearing it coming from someone who already has schizophrenia won't seem like such an attack. A lot of you have jumped on his paranoia a being based on made up scenarios but our neighbors really are quite bad. We have forced our landlord to enforce the upstairs tenant [18F] picking up her dog poop which she most definitely resents. She is also sisters with the neighbor beside us which is talking badly about us. I still suspect he is overhearing bits of conversation and jumping to the conclusion that they are talking about him. This is still paranoia though and I'm putting it in the category of not up to me but a medical professional to decide.  Your responses have also made me realize how much I am enabling my husband's behavior, leading him on with the delusion that he is doing nothing wrong. I feel more able to defend myself with the surety that regardless of my actions, this abuse is unacceptable. I do not deserve it. If his demeanor does not change I must leave for my son's sake. I have beat cancer, graduated at the top of my class in college, trekked through marshes, portaged for many kilometers and done many other ""hard"" things but make no mistake, if I do leave, it will be the hardest thing I have ever done since I am still afraid of his anger and it will be going against my very nature of avoiding conflict. I intend to seek counseling for myself to better deal with addressing conflicts. Things may not change over night but I am now charged with the certainty that the current circumstances are in no way healthy for my son. I want to thank you for all your responses and I must say, this is why I love Reddit.

 Or he improves greatly and we don't have to tag him or go through extensive negotiations to lock him up for next year. 
 This is a win/win. If this 16m cost us something, then fine. But it doesn't. It's costing us someone who was too old or too not good enough to make a different team's roster.

"I've been on Reddit for a while, but this is my first post, so I'll try and do everything right. 
 Me 22 M, her 21 F (7.5 years). Not talking about if we broke up. But if we weren't dating, would she be a person I would still be friends with? The 'appropriate' answer is OF COURSE I would. But I'm not sure that's the truth, and I don't know if that's a bad thing. The kind of relationship I have with her is a different kind of relationship than any other relationship I have. But we ARE really good friends. We just decide to do things together & take interest in each other's lives and hobbies instead of already having identical interests. To clarify, I think some friends hang out simply BECAUSE they have similar interests and build a friendship on that. I think we build our interests around each other, instead of building our friends around our interests. What does Reddit think?

"I didn't really fear the reaction of my friends and family when I outed myself a month ago - I live in a moderately progressive city with a significant LGBT populace, and I only know people with fairly lax attitudes about it. My best friend Derek [30M] outed himself as bisexual about two years ago, and there wasn't much issue. We had a family barbecue back in August, and I decided to finally tell everyone that I was gay. Everyone said things like ""we're so proud,"" or ""it's okay to be gay,"" etc, etc. I did make me happy that there were accepting, and I hoped I could move on with their support. 
 Nope. It seems that my family and friends thinks that being gay means I'm supposed too be a big spectacle. All they talk about is how I'm gay. Nothing else I do matters. My cousin is asking me weird questions like if I've ever thought of wearing lipstick. Everyone is offering to set me up with men. My father [64M] even suggested that I wasn't really interested in mountain biking (I've been biking since I was eight and it is a favorite hobby of mine) and didn't need to ""fake it"" anymore now that I wasn't in the closet. Female friends are inviting me to fashion shows even though I hate shopping and they have known that for years. And worst of all, on Labor Day they threw a massive over-the-top ""coming out"" party - complete with a rainbow flag cake and a banner saying ""GAY PRIDE!"" - even though they all know I'm fairly introverted. 
 Only Derek and my sister [25F] have been reacting sensibly to my outing. They tried to get everyone to back off after the party, but they were accused of shaming my sexuality. My mother [62F] even told me that Derek didn't understand what he was talking about because he was ""half-straight."" 
 I'm very disappointed at learning how stereotypical my loved ones views of homosexuality are. I used to admire these people, but they clearly no longer think highly of me. I'm just ""the gay one"" now. It's very emasculating and embarrassing. I think they would still respect me if I were straight. I am starting to hate my sexuality. 
 tl:dr: I outed myself. Wish I hadn't. Wish I wasn't gay.";30;M;FALSE;FALSE
"We have been together for a year. Our relationship started at the last semester of university, we are loving each other a lot that time. After our university finished we wanted to study for an exam like USMLE in our country. But we couldn't win that exam. So we had to start to work in september because it is compulsory, but we had to start at different cities. We can see each other once a month or sometimes two. We always talked on the phone. 
 By the time i am still studying for the exam again, and she quited her job to study exam in January. She moved into her parents home, still we are in different cities but it takes 2 hours to go. We couldn't meet for 2 months because she wanted to study and dont want interruption. We cant meet at 14th february, because of the lessons, she said dont come. I went with her some lessons together but after the lesson finished she wanted to go home and study. 
 Our problem is when our mutual friends get married or engaged, she is very upset and tells she wants too. I said i want that too, but first we need to live in same city and for that we need to win that exam. This happened 4-5 times. 
 We entered the exam and she got a good degree(point), but i couldn't. Last month she talked very cold to me, i tought she is very stressful because of the exam. After exam i wanted to meet and enjoy time together, she said she is tired but we met. We have spent 3 days together and i had to go back to my job after that. We talked about marriage i said i want that, she said she wants to spend some time with her family first, after that we can marry. 
 And another mutual friend get married too, we want that wedding together. She said me if i don't want to marry her she don't want to be in this relationship anymore. I said i really want to, but waiting to be live in same city first and i am working for that. 
 Now our mutual friends our getting engaged and they are living in different cities and one of them didn't win that exam. I think my gf felt really upset.  I wanted to meet her but she said she don't have time, she have work to do. I said we can make a plan but she said she can't. After that she met with her friends living in her city. I got upset and angry, told her that and said i miss her and want to see her. She said we are living in different cities and it's not easy. But it takes only 2 hours. 
 I thought she don't want to be with me anymore. She is talking a little on the phone and not talking lovely. I asked her is there any problem between us, she said yes. She thinks i dont want to marry her, she didn't want to force me to marry her, she feels awful and humiliating herself. When she thinks about me she didn't feel the love, the happiness she felt before, she feels bad now. She thinks i am not ready for marriage, if i feel myself ready for marriage and if she is still in here maybe we can be together she said. She said she didn't want to say that on the phone, wanted to talk face to face, i said we should. I said i am ready and i want to. I really want to marry her not because like she thinks she is forcing me. I always wanted to. She tells i only say i want to marry her when she behave colder to me. Now she says she don't want anymore, she isn't ready. 
 I have already bought her a ring months ago, but didn't give her. I took a photo of the ring and sent her. I said i am serious about marriage. I want to wait for the true time. She didn't sent me any reply. I called her and she didn't feel good for that. She said why i think if i sent her a ring photo she will feel good and make everything ok. But i wanted to. I said i will always try to fix our relationship because you are my life, the women i wanted to marry and want to be with her forever. She said don't try anymore, its over. 
 Now i am not talking with her for 2 days. Last time we talk she said she will come to talk face to face, i hope she will come to meet in 2 days. I love her and really want to marry her, i don't know what to do now. How can i get her want to be with me again? Should i propose her when she come? But if she says no. Can you give me some advice? Thanks 
 tl;dr : My girlfriend [24F] is breaking out with me [25M] because she think i don't want to marry her and she feels very awfull and humiliating herself. Because of this while she is thinking about me she doest feel love, happiness she felt before, she feels bad. I really love her and want to marry her. I need to fix our relationship.

"A little backstory, my husband (32m) and I have been together 6+ years. Shortly before we moved in together, my stepson ""Jake""'s bio mom (BM from here on out) got deep into heroin, crack and prostitution and left my husband to be a single father. When we moved in together (right after Jake's first birthday), I took on the mother role towards him and eventually, after coming to terms with the fact that BM was not going to improve (she has Fetal Alcohol Syndrome on top of drug addiction which played a role in her inability to bond with jake or keep him out of dangerous situations), we let Jake start calling me ""Mom"". We don't use ""step"" in this home, and for all intents and purposes I have adopted him, but no legal adoption or guardianship has taken place, just to clarify. I do refer to him as my son, though. 
 Until the age of 5 1/2ish, jake had no idea i hadn't given birth to him. We had planned to tell him in a few years, but didn't think it was the right time to introduce the notion to him,and hadn't mentioned BM for years because she was absent, so that's just kind of how it played out. That was until BM's mom (BG) took us to court for visitation. Now when BM first left, BG still had the occasional visit, for about 6mos (maybe 2-3 visits) until she, too, dissappeared without a trace. However,when she took us to court she lied and said we moved, changed our phone number and effectively hid Jake. None of which is true, but you'd be amazed at the discrimination against men in family court. Even men who have had sole custody since the child was 2 (which BM happily signed over, and has never paid a dime, we've never asked her for any support). 
 We did fight BG on visitation because we felt she was not consistent enough or safe for Jake to be around, with her enabling BM constantly and thinking she can do no wrong. Did I mention BG has custody of BM's 4 year old son that was born with crack and heroin in his system and thus has developmental delays? And this poor child has to deal with BM being in and out of his life. BG told me last christmas that BM was supposed to show up and never did. Finally showed up a few weeks later. BG also stopped coming to see Jake for about 6weeks this past spring, and then took us to court claiming.. Again.. That we had moved and changed our phone numbers. Even though we still had the phone numbers and were still living at the same address when we went to the court date this time, they brushed her blatant lies aside and continued visits. 
 Now BG has groomed Jake into believing her lies. She told Jake the reason BM hasnt been around is because my husband is mad at her for not taking care of Jake.. Which is not true, and also we have never spoken ill of her to him, only that she was sick and couldn't take care of him. She has told Jake anecdotes, showed him smiley pictures of BM and Jake as an infant or of BM and her other child, and romanticized BM to the point where he's expressed to her he wants to see BM. BG told Jake she'll have to take us to court because we are mad at BM. 
 Now, we have seen BM multiple times throughout the court process with BG. Not only has she confided in us that BG is thretening to withold visits with her other child if BM doesn't agree to BG visits (somehow because she hasnt had her rights terminated she still gets a say despite having not seen him since he was 1), but also at first expressed she was not interested in seeing Jake, then changed her mind and her, my husband, and I talked and felt that we could have them meet, but not introduce her as BM yet, just a friend of ours (because all 3 of us know she won't be consistent or healthy). She never brought it up again (it's been a year). That's just what she does. If visitation is allowed, it's what she'll do again. 
 I've explained to Jake again that BM is sick and had to explain the truth, that his father and I are not the reason BM is absent (and that neithet is he). But he is young, and of course doesn't conprehend fully. How can I explain drug addiction to a 7 year old in a way that he can understand? How can I make him understand that she is not going to get better any time in the conceivable future? My husband and I think that Jake should be older when he meets BM. But we may be forced into a less than ideal situation, and I don't want Jake getting hurt. Please help me out, Reddit. 
 TL:DR: Stepsons grandmother has romaticized her drag addicted, mentally unstable and absent parent daughter (his bio mom) to the point where he was to visit her. She is nowhere near healthy enough to do anything besides hurt him. How do I explain drugs and drug addiction to a 7year old? 
 Edit: For clarification. 1. We told him about him having a BM after court ordered visits with BG were assigned, before the first visit. 
 
 We're in NYS, which is a state which is difficult to get grandparents rights, this is purely due to her lies and court discrimination (as well as the law guardian being swayed by her lies). We are and always have been, legally and morally, fit parents. We have a 3yo son together as well and both our children are happy, healthy, smart, and polite. We pay our own bills, rent a nice big house with a backyard and animals, my disabled father in law moved in and helps with the kids (he can't work) when we have to work, we have a healthy marriage (2 years married), a stable and loving home. Nobody has accused us of being unfit, so we (or at least my husband) should have had a signifigant say in the court case. Yet he doesn't and I've never been able to say a word. 
 
 I would love nothing more than to terminate BM's rights and adopt my ""stepson"", but we don't have money forna lawyer and didn't qualify for a public defender. I also don't know if the law guardian would help or hinder us (probably hinder as he's swayed towards them). 
 
 I did explain, as well as I could, that we didn't keep jake from his BM or BG, and that honestly, BG was lying. i gave him the example of her not showing up for 6 weeks and claiming we moved. He knows we didn't move between when she stopped coming and when she resumed, and he is now PISSED. He doesn't want to see her at all now (and had expressed not wanting to see her for the past few visits before she sold him on the idea of BM). I wasn't trying to turn him against anyone, but was trying to be honest too.i don't know if that was the right thing to do.";32;m;FALSE;FALSE
"Okay, so my SO (21 f CAN) and I (20 m US) met online about a year and a half ago. We knew there was something between us, so we decided to go for the LDR last October. I immediately told my parents about the situation and how I was going to meet her over my winter break, since I still live with them while I finish school. They are (for the most part) completely supportive of our relationship. However, she has still not told her parents. She lives on her own for school about two hours away, and she doesn't drive, so it would be difficult for her to get to them. Obviously this is something she'd want to tell them in person. 
 At first, she thought about telling them before our first visit, but that would be during Christmas and she didn't want to cause that big of a commotion during the holidays - and that is completely understandable. 
 So our first visit came and went (amazingly, by the way), and she planned on telling them the next time she went home, which would be her spring break. I was getting excited for her to finally tell them, but then all of a sudden she decided she'd rather stay home for the break. I was a little disappointed, but that was okay. When she is with her family, it's almost as if I don't exist because she is still trying to hide our relationship until she finds a good time to tell them - meaning I get one or two messages a day opposed to our constant all day normal talking. So being able to talk to her for the whole week was a good enough reason to not care at the time. 
 Fast forward until the day before her spring break. She decides she wants to go home now. I was fine with that, thinking she'd tell them finally. Wrong. After the whole week of barely talking she gets home, and I asked if she told them. She said she wanted to wait until after her exams to tell them now. Again, I'm disappointed, but I can understand the reasoning. 
 So last night I brought it up (I never do because I don't want to seem like I'm pushing her to do anything. I know she wants to tell them, but I just get curious). Her exams are next week, so I asked when the next time she'd be going to her parents'. She told me it would be for her mother's birthday, and she really wasn't sure she'd want to tell them on her birthday. Which is understandable. 
 But I'm just getting tired of all these things coming up that are pushing it off. I hate having to not exist every time she's with her family. I don't like being hung up on while on Skype mid-sentence once every few hours when her parents call to talk. I get annoyed with all of the privacy settings I have to go through on Facebook so her family doesn't see me. All the little things like that, which add up... as you can see. 
 I know this is not her fault, but am I wrong for feeling this way? I just feel like it's bothering me more than it should.

"I [23m] was in a terrible mood last night and then we got to talking, and long story short, I called my woman [21f] fat (she's actually pretty hot). I apologized and told her that I had just lashed out at her because I was in a bad mood from work. (We have been dating for 2 years now) 
 About an hour later, things were back to normal and I told her very seriously that I thought she was beautiful. Her response was, ""Sometimes one bad statements can out-weigh 100 good ones."" 
 So, now to be awesome, I want to think of 100 + 1 = 101 ways to say that she is beautiful. I don't care if you guys say that she's more beautiful than a summers day or a truck, let's just get to 101!!

"I was camping over Memorial Day Weekend in upstate New York.  Woke up early that morning (it was raining and chilly from the weather) to go outside my tent and take a post drinking pee.  I got out of the sleeping bag only wearing boxers and went outside. 
 My eyes were slightly crusted over and I was off balance but walked over to this hill to urinate off the edge.  As I walked up my bare foot slipped and I tumbled head over heals down this 8 foot (2.42m) hill landing on rocks and cold mud.  The side of my face somehow got smashed and I lay there on the ground bleeding from my nose and mouth, freezing, and covered in mud. 
 Took a few seconds to realize that I had already started to pee, in my boxers.  Shortly after I had completed my mission I got back up, slightly discombobulated from hitting my face and walked back towards the tent. 
 Best part:  I go to unzip the tent and catch inbetween my toes on the tent anchor and fall forward onto (not into) the tent.  Two people start screaming from the inside and I get up and now run away.  Turns out, I went into another couples tent that was the same color as mine (Eureka Copper Canyon 1312). 
 Eventually I got back to my tent, covered in blood and mud, answered a bunch of questions for my GF about what the hell happened, got dressed, and snuggled back into my sleeping bag.

"Hi, everyone, thanks in advance for reading this! 
 My boyfriend Adam [22M] and I [18F] have been dating for two years. He lives an hour away, so our LDR isn't very long distance, but it still affects us as he's a student working his way through college, and I can't quite drive yet due to financial issues in my home (can't afford a car or insurance for myself). 
As my last year of high school is coming to a close, and I've applied to colleges, I've been starting to think about what our relationship would come to. I'm a firm believer and understand...er of the whole ""don't go to a school for your SO"" and that factor is not hindering my college decision in any way. However, my top and dream school happens to be within 10-20 minutes from him. It's also one of the nation's most ridiculously selective schools. 
Realistically, I will not be getting in that school, and I'll most likely be attending a college about 3 hours away from my hometown, so about 4 hours from him. We have discussed this, and came to the decision that it would be up to me at that point whether I wanted to continue the relationship or not. 
 The problem? I'm extremely curious, sexual, and I love people. 
This sounds pretty easy. I shouldn't have to sacrifice having a good time and experience in college for a boyfriend so far away, essentially putting my life on hold for him. 
However, I'm extremely attached to Adam. I love him dearly, and though we have our problems as in any other relationship, I can see myself being with him in the future/ living together because we work very practically as a couple (financially, lifestyle wise etc.). 
 We both discussed tonight that we'd like to explore other relationships. We both want to see what being with someone else is like (as each other's first relationship, we've been pretty limited), both to see more of what we need and like in people and so we can grow to appreciate each other more (e. g. maybe someone else I date wouldn't love me in the language that he does). We also both agreed that we'd like to ""come back"" to each other, as in live together in the future. 
 I have an extremely high libido and just an oversexual nature that requires a lot of attention and stimulation to be satisfied (a manifestation of some issues I faced as a child, I have seen counseling about this and it is largely not unhealthy). I know 100% that if I am far from my boyfriend in college and cannot see him regularly, I will have diverting thoughts and feel compelled to date/hook up with/explore other people. As I am also questioning my sexuality, I know for sure that with the freedom I have in college and without the distinct presence of my boyfriend, I will have a very difficult time staying loyal. 
 A friend (well, ex-friend in a way, we are no longer in contact) of mine introduced me to polyamory a while back, which I, out of curiosity, subsequently researched and explored as an idea. The concept actually came up in tonight's talk with Adam, and he seemed to share the curiosity that I feel towards it -- there was no indication that either of us would for sure be polyamorous. 
 I think something like polyamory would be a relatively good solution to my dilemma. Adam has expressed openness to this idea, and I'd like to bring some other possible solutions to the table for us to discuss. Whether you suggest an open relationship or that we just break up, I am receptive to any possibilities! 
 Thanks so much! 
 edit: to clarify, our discussion about exploring other relationships was not us saying that we no longer want to be together. we are both perfectly content with the way our relationship is at this present moment. 
 tl;dr  bf and I together two years, live an hour apart. I'm going to college soon, probably further away from him, feel like I'm gonna ""party"" it up bc I'm overly sexual and questioning my orientation. bf and I agree that we'd like to have a future together, but also agree that we'd like to try other people, have discussed polyamory. any other possible solutions?";22;M;FALSE;FALSE
"As the title says, on paper Courtney is perfect. We've been together for over 2 years although I had a crush on her throughout high school, even though we dated other people. I once even helped a guy I knew ask her out and they dated for a year or so.
One night a few years ago as I was just fresh out of a 2yr relationship(fresh as in a week prior), she passed by me at my [then] place of work and did a double take. That night I got a Facebook message, and we just went with it. Let me describe her a bit. 
 She's easily the type of girl who could become a Victoria's Secret model. Tall, blonde bombshell with incredibly long legs and a face that makes most of my friends jaws drop. She's a half inch or so taller than me, at 6'. In fact, many people I meet for the first time with her believe me when I say she's a model until I tell them otherwise. She's outgoing, goes to a great school and is about to graduate with the highest honors. She's very driven, and she's going to have no problem landing a high paying job. Basically, her sole focus in life is graduating from college and getting hired, working, a nice house with a picket fence and NOT having kids. Courtney loves to talk and gossip, hates drinking and drugs and I believe her to be a very loyal person due to the horror stories she's told me of discovering the affairs her dad had. She also always needs to be in control, including attempting to control our relationship from time to time. 
 A little about me, I'm not very attractive. I'm a web developer for a small start up company, and it took me 6.5 years to get a 4 year degree. I wouldn't say I'm lazy, rather, I make sure I live every day as if I may not be around tomorrow. I'm a patient yet outgoing person who stops and appreciates the scenery of life and I make sure to keep my adrenaline pumping by means of riding my motorcycles, snowboarding and adventuring.
Basically Courtney and I have 2 things in common, we both love to cuddle, yes just cuddle. And we both have to be right about everything. This causes a lot of arguments that escalate to unreasonable fighting. 
 In terms of the sex, at first it was great and frequent. However it was always initiated by me, and as the relationship continued on over the past 2 years I became less attracted to her because she would not come on to me. Thus, the sex became infrequent unless she was so horny she absolutely had to do something. And believe me, we've talked about it numerous times and she has not changed it. It has come to the point where I will see her 15-20 days out of the month and we will have sex once or twice. The rest of the time she'll tell me we don't have sex enough and the argument ends in silence when I say ""you need to come on to me more"". 
 Pretty much the only things we do when we are together are hang out with her friends, cuddle and watch movies, eat dinner and argue. I try to encourage her to do spontaneous things with me but she will have no part in them, she has almost zero sense of humor.
One of the main things that really bugs me is she does not enjoy doing any of the activities or hobbies I like and flat out refuses to try them. I have no problems doing what she likes to do, like go shopping, help her pick out clothes/ make up, and watch chick flicks(I actually love chick flicks). Most importantly I do these things with her because it makes her happy. 
 So basically I'm 2 years in with Courtney who always needs her life planned out, meanwhile I want to live one day at a time. I want to be active and take long motorcycle rides and go rock climbing/hiking and such, she wants to be working or gossiping on her phone in hopes that she will have a ""good life"". I always tell her that she doesn't need to have everything planned out in her twenties but she doesn't agree. The way she talks about her plans I feel pressured to keep up just to please her and it honestly stresses me out. I'm not saying her mindset is bad, I'm just saying I'm not sure if she's the type of person I should plan to be with for the rest of my life. She's 22, and says she never wants kids. I'm 24, and say I want kids when I'm a little older than 30. My family always tells me ""she's a keeper"" ""don't ever give her up"" ""anyone other than her is a downgrade"" ""we don't know how you got so lucky to have a girl like that"" 
 If I'm being honest, I think I want a girl who wants to go out to a bar every Friday night with just me, have a few beers and then give me a sexy look before she drags me back home to have her way with me. I think I want a girl who wants to get up on Sunday morning, get on my motorcycle and take a long ride up to the mountains with me. I feel like I want a girl who listens to the same music I do, who will enthusiastically hang out with my friends and I and not complain when we're going to bed. I want a girl who occasionally just wants to do whatever I'm doing. A girl that doesn't yell at me for being goofy in public. 
 You may think that's a far fetched idea that only happens in a movie, yet I just met a girl[20F] like that the other day, which is what inspired me to post this. Bumped into her in the building my company has their office, we looked at each other and I could swear there was a connection like they talk about in movies. Sure enough, later that day a note had been left on my car with her number. She had seen me getting out of it earlier that morning and made it a point to approach me. We got to talking, I told her I'm currently with someone but not before I realized we have a lot in common. Much more in common then Courtney and I. However, she's not as driven and definitely not as much of a looker, she's also 4 years younger. My parents would certainly not give her as much approval. But it got me thinking, am I really happy with the person I'm with? I have one life to live, do I go with the road I know will be comfortable, maybe not as enjoyable but most likely comfortable? Or do I go with the road that seems to fit my personality and may make my adventurous side more enjoyable, but probably less comfortable? 
 Do hold out for Courtney? Is it a possibility she may change as she gets older? Is it a possibility I'll change into someone with Courtney's mindset as I get older? Is this whole thing just the rush of meeting someone new who's interested in me(it doesn't happen often, if ever)?
I'm going to speculate that most of you will say ""you made this post, you already know how to answer your own questions"" but I'm still looking for advice anyway. 
 I'm sorry this post is so disorganized, I'm just spilling everything I'm thinking about and I'm sure I left out some important details. I'm also not the best writer. I realize there's people out there with much worse problems than this one, but I still want to ask for the opinions of the reddit relationship gurus.

"My best friend in college for the past year has some severe depression/anxiety issues. I try very hard to make her life easier because I see the pain she goes through everyday. She also has an online best-friend [18F] for the past 6 months of which does an even better job than me in keeping her stable. I have no connection to this girl. They are virtually connected at the hip, texting night and day. 
 Yes, I realize it is nobodies job to keep someone happy, but I decided I wanted to help her out, and I don't take the responsibility lightly. She tried therapy and it ended terribly, and she is deathly afraid of going back (not to say I don't try and talk her into going back). 
 For the past month, online best friend has not been talking to her, thus making my friend very unstable. She barely sleeps and is starting to struggle in school. So this is where I might have messed up. 
 I decide to look up her friend on facebook, and ask her, in confidence, why she would do that, and that she should at least tell her why she is no longer talking. It was said about as polite and concise as just stated, no drama. 
 The next day, my best friend messages me that she knows what I did, that she isn't mad because I only did it to help, and not to worry about it. And then proceeded to ignore me. 
 I'm starting to get this sinking feeling that I should have just stayed out of it. Was I wrong trying to play mediator? She means the world to me, as I don't have a lot, and losing her trust would be crushing. I only wanted to help. She claims to not be mad, but I can feel an underlying tone of insincerity. 
 
 tl;dr : Was it wrong to help my deteriorating and depressed friend by playing mediator, going behind her back to try to talk to her friend that began ignoring her?";18;F;TRUE;FALSE
"I [22F] am in a relationship with a depressed man [33M].
He knows that I'm submissive and has agreed to tie me up and spank me and give me some forced orgasms and due to his depression we didn't get the chance yet to try it out.
But I'm worried that this won't be enough for me, that I need to be dominated most of the time in the relationship. Not exactly being told what to do all the time, but being grabbed and touched whenever he feels like, in general things that make me feel desired and like he is the leader. He is very nice to me but his day to day behavior doesn't give me the impression that he could be that forceful. It looks more like I'm in charge most of the time and I say what we do and he doesn't mind, unless he says otherwise. 
I already told him, that I need this kind of intimacy and that I'm afraid I might have to leave if I can't get it. 
 When I fantasize and when I cum, I always think about dominant men who take control of me and my body. I can't come thinking of him. And I'm afraid he doesn't turn me on in general 
 So I was wondering, and also desperately hoping, that maybe he could be more dominant, but that his depression has buried this side of him. And I thought that maybe his self-esteem could be increased when he starts working out, since he always says he was so much more fit when he was younger. 
 If that's not possible and he's simply too vanilla for me I have decided to wait until he gets therapy, until we can have sex again and then leave him when he can't make me happy, which will be really hard for me, so much even that I wondered if I could just try to ignore my kinky side. But that would be so hard since it feels like we are soulmates, just not sexually.
I love him and this topic has made me highly desperate and frustrated over the last few month.
But I don't want to have to leave him after marrying him and realizing it doesn't work.
It feels really bad, to be so connected to someone but having to fear that my sexual desires ruin this relationship. 
 tl;dr  Depressive bf, not dominant, don't want to leave him, could he secretly be dominant or do I have to give up and have a very painful break up?";22;F;TRUE;FALSE
"Note: WON'T stop, i know that i CAN i just don't know how. 
 I (23F) have been with my boyfriend, Jay(20M), for about a year and we live together. I am incredibly insecure, and tend to act incredibly ridiculous. I cannot trust my boyfriend, though he's really done nothing to deserve it, I feel like it all stems from my own insecurities. 
 Jay is younger than me, and in my opinion, out of my league looks wise. We are two peas in a pod , and love each other deeply; but I can't seem to stop myself from prying and trying to find him doing something wrong. I feel insane. When he's on his phone, I find myself watching,  wondering who he's typing to. When he leaves the room I grab his phone and look, when he sleeps I check his facebook, my life is revolved around catching him out, and I never find anything. 
 Jay is aware that I go through his phone, not how often I do it though. I check deleted messages on Facebook and theres nothing, check activity logs and there's nothing. A normal person would take the signs that have been consistent for about 3 or 4 months (at first i would see messages from girls that I didn't approve of, nothing bad on his part just my jealousy and inability to allow him to have female friends), and deduce that he just isn't doing anything wrong. Not me, I'm convinced he's just really good at hiding it. We're together most of the time when not working and I find myself watching the way his fingers move to see if he Is doing a ""long push"" and possibly deleting something. Its absolutely ridiculous and I know it. And let me reiterate,  I never find anything, or signs of him deleting anything. 
 Jay for the most part just ignores what I do because as he says he has nothing to hide. But now I find myself scared when he leaves, I can't help but think he'll be flirting or enjoying the company of a more attractive woman. This really pisses him off, he takes my accusations as a shot at his character. He says that he can't understand why I think he's just this guy that goes around fucking any girl he sees because he's not that guy at all. He loves me, he wants to be with me, no one's ever made him feel like I do etc etc. Plus the fact that he's still with me while I do all these crazy things probably means he loves me. 
 I know that what I'm doing is wrong, and Jay doesn't deserve this. I just feel like it's too good to be true. I'm overweight and Jay is very attractive. He does music and is often being looked at by many women. And then there's the age, he's not even 21...and instead of feeling happy about the future we plan to have together, I dread his next birthday and the inevitable trips to the bar with his boys. I feel like soon enough I'll be old and boring and he'll move on. He says by me thinking this way I am going to make that happen, not in a threatening way, just that negative thinking brings negative results. 
 I guess what I want advice on is how to stop acting this way, how to feel more comfortable in my own skin, and how to accept the love my boyfriend wants to give me. I don't want to be the crazy bitch who gets mad at her boyfriend for going out, I don't want to sit and wonder what he's doing and fight myself not to call.  I don't want to go through his phone, I don't want to fight about me thinking he finds some girl attractive. I don't want to feel inferior. But i really just want to stop acting like a psycho girlfriend, because I don't want my boyfriend to leave me. 
 Tl; dr My constant accusations with no proof are hurting my boyfriend, how can I stop being a nutter?";23;F;TRUE;FALSE
"For clarification, BPD stands for borderline personality disorder and is a mental illness characterized by self harm and threats of suicide, a need for attention, black and white thinking, aggression, ""splitting"" (going from extreme love to extreme hate, usually for the person closest to them), and overall unstable mood and relationships. 
 I'll try to make this as quick as I can. I'm not sure if this is the right sub to post to. My friend is not undergoing any sort of treatment for her BPD, and has an extremely antagonistic relationship towards any sort of mental health services. After a breakup last week with another friend of mine [17M, 2 year relationship] (a breakup largely due to the symptoms of untreated BPD), she is threatening suicide on the daily on a social media platform (not facebook). Not ""I want to die"", but ""I'm going to kill myself Sunday"". She last attempted after a breakup as well. 
 I've already felt like I had to talk her out of it a month ago after an argument with her then boyfriend, and she's talked about writing suicide notes. I'm going to consult with her ex/my buddy tomorrow on what to do, but for many justified reasons he wants nothing to do with her. Contacting the family is absolutely 100% out of the question, believe me. She hates the psychiatric system, so if she's not literally on the verge of dying, she would hate me for calling 911 on her. That would only isolate her further, as she has no other close friends she can talk to. What exactly do I do here? I'm really worried for her, but I feel powerless on what I can do besides tell her I care and don't want her to die :( 
 TL;DR: Friend with Borderline Personality Disorder says she's going to kill herself tomorrow, do I call emergency services and risk her hating me if she isn't actually serious?";17;M;FALSE;FALSE
"My dad, Dan, is a really cool guy, a great dad, I love him, but he is unfortunately kind of known for being insensitive. 
 Frankly his comments are an embarrassment to all of us. Almost every time my family goes out to eat or does something fun he make some sort of comment to the waiter, or person working in the retail store etc: ""I need to find the transgender bathroom. I'm  confused "" and 100% of the time the waiter or other person just ignores the comment or gives this awkward giggle. 
 In public especially with family friends he'll loudly say ""I'M TRANSGENDER"" and we all just scoff and roll our eyes, tell him to shut up, etc. We don't entertain his comments at all, and anytime we try to tell him to stop he tells us to just ""get over it"" ""It's just a joke"" and that we're ""politically correct hippies"". 
 We were at an art event the other day and there was a drag queen there. My dad sees the queen, then turns and starts to shout ""THE BATHROOM IS--"" before my sister [22F] literally took her hand and covered his mouth. He kept trying to say things and my sister and I yelled at him to stop, physically grabbing his arms and trying to make him walk away from the situation. Thankfully we distracted him too much for him to get anything else out. 
 It gets worse when he's around his buddy Bruce. Bruce is very homophobic and racist, despite that his daughter identifies as bisexual and my dad, Dan, is Mexican. Bruce's comments about ""lazy Mexicans"" seem to roll right off my dad's back (he never joins in but he also never says anything), despite that his own father came here from Mexico, but my dad joins right in on any other racist comments ""I've never seen a black man working hard"" etc etc. He also gossips about two of my friends who are white women dating black men, saying they're ""ruining their lives"" and that they're ""gonna be baby mommas"" etc. 
 What's more is that my sister is dating a guy from Chile, who is currently living here on a work visa  that my dad is providing him through his own business , I've already heard the ""he just wants his green card"" comments from Bruce and more of my dad's buddies. 
 This happens nearly every time I am out in public with my dad, but he only seems to do it when we're in a large group of people. It rarely happens when it's just me, my mom, and my sister, I think because he knows we do not tolerate that behavior. 
 I realize at this point I've neglected to mention my mom's reaction--she hates this as much as everyone else and has even snapped at him a few times. He basically just gives her a smirk, but he does stop for the time being. 
 I'm actually worried that someone is going to overhear my dad and take legit offense and hurt my dad. People already look at us in public like we're ""those people"". Some of his comments, especially around Bruce, make me want to cringe right under the table. Just to reiterate, we've tried saying things to him and Bruce, telling them it's not okay, and they just brush it off like ""it's just a joke, you guys are too politically correct"" 
 I personally don't think it's ""just a joke"" to them because it's CONSTANT. 
 I don't know what to say to him or Bruce to make them cut it out. 
 tl;dr Dad makes loud offensive comments in public, we've tried saying stuff to him and he won't stop. What do I do next time it happens?";22;F;FALSE;FALSE
"I am not sure which flair to assign. This is a past relationship and I wanted perspective on the issues we had. Sorry about the long post.... 
 We are both students. She [30F] is an exchange student from Argentina who studied in Paris before moving to our current school in North America. She was in a 3 year relationship with an abusive boyfriend with mental issues, and suffers from depression herself. I [28M] am have strong introvert tendencies when it comes to personal matters, but project an extrovert personality in the work environment. I know it sounds contradictory but I essentially joke and make conversation but never talk about myself with my co-workers. I suffered from depression in highschool because I had no close friends, I have about 3 now. 
 My exGF is a beautiful woman, very intelligent (PhD student), speaks 4 languages, and is very introverted. We work together in the same department at our school, and were in classes together during our relationship. Due to the small size of our cohort, she wanted to keep our relationship private, at least until it developed into something more serious. 
 So my exGF broke up with her abusive BF 4 months before we got together. She was still in contact with him and his continued his abusive behaviour towards her (more on this later). 
 We started dating at the beginning of November, things got very intimate quickly (she went down on me on the first date but turned down my reciprocation). Every single date we had the first month ended up with us in heavy make outs and her going down on me in parking lots, campus washrooms, my office, and her office. She was very cautious I used a condom every time, and refused to let me do anything else until we were both tested. The results came back a week before Christmas. Things were going well in the relationship and I asked her to come spend Christmas with my family. We are both studying in my hometown so it seemed appropriate. She declined, she wasn't ready to meet my family. Come Christmas day, we exchange gifts, watched a movie, she cooked at her place, I spend the morning and afternoon with her and we have sex for the first time. Come dinner time I leave to go have dinner with my mother and siblings (the dinner I invited her to). I knew that we were likely going to have sex that day, so I prep my A game because she had been so amazing with her generosity. I make sure she climaxes several times, I climax once and it takes 45 minutes - I swear this is relevant. 
 Quick interjection: She is self conscious about her body image and her abilities as a GF. She had only one BF before me and it was the abusive ex. He was her first and only, and during their relationship they had made several sex tapes (digital). I have been with a number of women and this was an issue for her. 
 A few days later, I go to see her and she looks exhausted. We talk a bit and she brings up that she is still in contact with her exBF. Standard ""I don't feel comfortable with that"" conversation occurs, she informs me her ex has threatened suicide if she cuts contact with him. She is a clinical therapist, I point out the abusive tactic and tell her she knows allowing the his behaviour to continue was not healthy. Ultimately, I could not convince her to end contact. 
 My birthday is about a week after Christmas so I tell her how I plan to celebrate. I want her to be there, but mutual friends from the school will be there so she is hesitant to attend. I press the subject because I am infatuated with this woman and I want to spend my birthday with her. I decide to spend the my actual birthday with her and move the party to a different day.  Fast forward to the my birthday, we spend the entire day in bed only breaking for food and water and a shared shower at one point. Everything was perfect in my mind - intelligent, sophisticated, and beautiful woman likes me and we have amazing sex. 
 I have size issues with my equipment, due to past experiences, as a result try very hard to make sure I am doing a good job. I kept a mental count of orgasms and at one point I verbalize it. She chuckles and we continue.My asinine mistake was that instead of staying over that night I went home afterwards. 
 cue fight that night 
She was completely justified. At the time I had thought I was not welcome to stay over, because in the past she had sent me home since her parents skype her all the time and she lives in a bachelor suite. I worked the next day so my instinct is to go home. Fight ensues, she says I want her only for sex, that I don't even like her, and that any one would have satisfied me. So that thing about me taking 45 minutes to climax? Regular occurrence even when she goes down on me. Her insecurities come into play, says that I can't come because she isn't good at sex - etc etc. 2 hours into the argument and I lose my cool say ""You aren't that pretty that I would only want you for sex"" and swear ""fuck why can't you listen to me"". She hangs up. I call back, no answer, I call again and she picks up. We continue - 230am rolls around and she tells me to come over so we can talk in person. I drive over - takes about 40 minutes. Knock, go in, she fell asleep, tells me shes tired, and wants to sleep and talk about it in the morning. We cuddle a bit and fall asleep. She knows I have to work at 9 so she wakes me up at 8 with a BJ. I wake up thinking OMG this is amazing, but realize that we need to talk. I tell her to stop and that we need to talk. Afterwards she seems less upset, I go to work. 
 A few weeks later, she calls me up crying uncontrollably. Her ex had found out she was seeing me and threatened suicide AND to send around her sex tapes to friends and family. I try and talk her through it, she calms down and tells me she will call me later. The next day she ends things with me. I am in tears - so I go drinking because alcohol. 
 A two weeks later, we're hanging out with mutual friends, I am driving, drop the friends off, she and I are in the car. We jump each other, finds I am freshly shaved (I was only trimmed when I was with her), storms off. I have size issues, I shaved because it looked lost in the forest and I don't like that. I chase her to her door and she refuses to talk. I leave and call her from the car. She picks up, I try to explain but she doesn't believe me. Next day she calls me during work hours and tells me to come see her. I go almost immediately, we make out, she goes down on me. Afterwards I ask her what this means - she says FWB. I was hesitant but I didn't want to lose her again and I was grasping at straws. 
 A month later. FWB doesn't work. She calls me crying saying she couldn't handle it that her feelings were too strong. I tell her I still have the feels for her, but we can stop. She says she doesn't know. We end up hanging out a few more times, and poof we are back together- sort of. She begins playing this hot and cold game. We hang out, she acts like a GF, I get confused, we hang out I act like a BF and try to stay over, she tells me that I shouldn't do that, we hang out and she tells me I am being too cold. Rinse and repeat. We are still having sex throughout this period. Up to this point (about 4 months in) she still hasn't agreed to meet my friends or any of my family. 
 The finale...
Fast forward end of March, she seems stressed, tired, and tells me she hasn't been sleeping. I ask if it is because of school work, she says it is because of her ex. He is still harassing her, I offer to try and intervene, and she refuses. This conversation occurs twice more, and I tell her something has to be done because this is starting to destroy her. She has lost weight, doesn't eat, doesn't sleep. I insist she get help, and call her exBFs mother and have her intervene. We argue for days. She drops a bomb on me - she doesn't have feelings for me anymore and the last few times we had sex, she didn't want to, and she cried after wards because she felt dirty. I feel like I raped her and I sit there in shock. We talk for a little bit. I felt like throwing up because I feel like I forced myself on her. She tells me she was never sure about us, and it was my fault that she felt that way. I tell her we should end things and left. She never explained why she felt that way about me. 
 I still work with her, still have feelings for her, we do not speak to each other. Every time I see her it frustrates me that I don't fully understand how ended up quite as badly as they did. 
 I don't know if this helps- she said ""I love you"" right before Christmas. I told her I wasn't ready to say it. She said it wasn't meant as the ""I want to marry you I love you"" but the Argentinian version of ""I care deeply for you"". I take the words very seriously- in the I can't stop thinking about you kind of way and not seeing you ruins my day. 
 This shit sounds crazier than I remember it being. 
 
 tl;dr : Mandatory summary - Past relationship, crazy shit happened, relationship ended, she blamed me - I have no idea why. Why do you think things ended so poorly?";30;F;FALSE;FALSE
"I am the 40F and we've dated for over a year.   I am very frustrated over what I feel was a ""bait and switch"".  He was really attentive and sexy and flirty at first ( ""can't wait to get you in my bed""  type of thing), but once he felt secure in our relationship and that I was going to be there, he put me on a back burner and turned his attention to hobbies and work. 
 
 I am not high maintenance, but I have been feeling so lonely.  We often will go weeks without sex.  It can be difficult to make it happen (I have a roommate, he has his kids part-time), but I'm seeing that even when we are able to be totally alone, sex seems far down on the list of things he wants to be doing with me.  If anything, it is relegated for late at night after he's done whatever he's working on, but by that time I'm both tired and sad (sad that he isn't turned on enough apparently by the thought of sex with me that he leaves it for the very last thing). 
 
 
 The thing is, he  seems  to be interested in sex, in the way that he notices beautiful women a lot, he pays for porn, he's had many sexual partners in the past. So I don't get it.  I get hurt when I'm there with him ALONE and hoping he'll put down his work to give me some attention, but instead he just keeps working and will make a passing comment about some actresses breasts.  ???  My breasts are right over here waiting yet he's more immersed in television. 
 
 
 What could cause this?  We have only been having sex (infrequently) for a year, so how could he be bored?  There is so so much we haven't tried yet.  I am very into him, so I just don't get why he would be bored with our sex life  already .  I really really want this relationship to work (I've invested so much already, but also at my age I just want to finally settle down).  He also wants very much to settle down with me. 
 
 
 I've tried openly communicating many times.  I've asked him if he's attracted to me (he says he is), why he doesn't seem interested in sex (he claims he is, but he is just busy or distracted or doesn't think about it.....how can a healthy man not think about sex after 6 weeks without it??).  I've asked him if he feels he has low libido and he says he doesn't think so (it seems very low with me -- maybe other women have been able to get more of a rise out of him). 
 
 
 Over the past month, my frustration has grown.  There have been too many weeks when I have really been looking forward to sex but it never happens for various reasons, and he seems to not even notice.  I have been making remarks here and there, and finally last week I blew up at him.  I told him I feel unattractive with him and that I think he's just not very into me.  I told him that I'm lonely and he's so distracted all the time with work and I get zero physical contact with him.   He just told me he is attracted to me, that yes he does get very distracted and if I want sex so bad I should come and  __  him. 
 
 
 Agreed, but I also want him to show me he wants it because I've become very insecure about that.  I feel like he doesn't want me.   After I said all that (and felt rather humiliated about admitting some of that stuff to him), he never brought it up again.  He didn't ever tell me that he heard me and suggest changes or anything.  If the tables were turned and my partner told me how hurt they are thinking I'm not turned on by them, I would sure make it a priority to show them I am (or at least talk about it -- I wouldn't just disagree and forget about it). 
 
 
 Now I'm thinking we need to break up.  Is it possible that at 40 he just isn't really into sex?  I know sex drive diminishes with age, but does it seem likely that someone who was very into sex previously would now be cool with sex every 6 weeks??   My main question:  I can deal with low sex (ex: I'll buy a vibrator!) to keep my relationship if I feel that this is just who he is but that he's still very into me.  I'm trying hard to understand if it's just low testosterone / age, or if the truth is he isn't into me.   Any help? 
 
 tl;dr:  BF just doesn't seem to care that much about sex with me after only 1 year.  In fact, he never really seemed to care about it after the first time he got me in bed.  But he claims to want a long-term, stable relationship with me.";40;F;TRUE;FALSE
"My (20f) ex-boyfriend and best friend (23m) seems to fall for women that are bad for him. About 8 months before we started dating, he had finally broken up with his girlfriend of five years. From what I've heard, she was not at all nice to him. They did not get along in any way for the last two years of their relationship. She never wanted to have sex and constantly made him feel bad for things that he liked that seemed pretty normal to me. 
 Then we met and started dating (long distance) and he was really happy and pretty much fell in love with me instantly. A few months after we started dating, he told me that he didn't think he was ready to have a girlfriend, he didn't know what he wanted, he was confused about his feelings, and a bunch of other stuff like that. Well I was really in love with him and wanted to do anything to help him with what he was going through. I didn't realize that he essentially broke up with me. We started dating in February and broke up around April. 
 From April until July, I had a strong feeling that something was going on between him and a coworker (26f) of his that was married. During a visit to see him in May, he finally confessed that they kissed once. Don't forget that I'm still under the impression that we are still together. This upset me a lot, but I was still completely in love with him and wanted to do anything to help him. 
 In July, he came to visit me and that's when I found out the whole truth. While he was taking a shower, I looked at his Skype messages between him and his coworker. There were some messages about the sex they had recently as well as a few ""I love you's."" They started seeing each other in March. Any time I had asked him in the past if anything was going on between the two of them, he always denied it. As he was getting out of the shower, I went up to ask him again and even though it was pretty obvious that I knew something, he denied it again. Then he finally admitted it when I showed him the Skype messages. 
 He went back home and we continued to try to maintain a friendship. We also tried to be friends with benefits because the sex we had was awesome. He would always tell me that he really cared about me and possibly had feelings for me, but wasn't sure. He always wanted to be best friends with me. He told me that he is most comfortable around me. That he can be himself in every way. That I am caring and understanding. We had amazing sex together. Everything between us was pretty much perfect, yet he still didn't love me anymore. 
 A few months after he went home after that July visit, the married coworker moved a few hours away for school and they stopped talking. A few weeks ago, they saw each other at a wedding and they started talking again. He drove two hours to go visit her three times within one week. Then one day he told me that he thinks he wants something with this girl and that we need to stop having sex. This girl is the complete opposite of me in every way, from looks, to interests, to morals. She encouraged my friend to lie to me and do things that he wouldn't typically do. She is separated from her husband, but apparently they are still involved sometimes. She is extremely manipulative and made me out to be the bad guy when I told my friend that I disapprove of their friendship. 
 One night that he spent the night at her house, after confessing his feelings about her to both me and her, she went through his phone and found some messages between me and him. They were sent a few days before he said he wanted to stop and after he said that, we didn't do anything. She got really mad at him because he had said nothing was going on between the two of us. Which was true at the time. They got into a huge fight and they've been keeping their distance. 
 They are getting together to talk in a few days and he tells me that he is in love with her and will always love her but he doesn't think they should be together right now. I don't think they should ever be together because she will always lie and cheat. She never admits to her own faults, like lying to her husband about sleeping with another man and then lying to my friend about still sleeping with her husband after they were separated. I just do not trust her at all. And I wonder how he could love someone like her. 
 I still have feelings for him sometimes, but I am getting over them and moving on finally. But I also wonder why he loves everything about me but he is not in love with me. It doesn't make any sense to me. I feel so much better since I've looked at our relationship as just friends. I still care about him a lot and I want him to be happy. He deserves a great girl who will treat him right, but he falls for the girls who hurt him. 
 So why did he love his ex-girlfriend for five years even though she treated him horribly? Why does he love this other girl who lies and cheats all the time and is ready to give her so many chances? And why does he not love me, when he said that I was the best girlfriend he ever had, he is comfortable around me, and cares about me.

"Alright, crash course for background material: 
 I am not completely sure if my mom is a N or not. She was raised by an abusive Ndad, so she has fleas at the very least. I know she loves me, and everything she says is coming from a place of fear. She is terrified of me making the same ""mistakes"" she did, and is determined that I be better. That being said, she is very Catholic. 
 I (22F) have been in a LDR with my boyfriend (25M) for the past four years. I am graduating college this year and plan on moving out with him this summer ~2,000 miles away from my family. This news obviously puts my mom into panic/distress, saying things like, ""You're abandoning your family!"" , ""It feels like you're running away from us!"" , ""What did we do to deserve this?"" , & ""Why didn't (boyfriend) find a job here? Does he not care about you? The man needs to move to the woman! Anybody will tell you that!"" And other questions about his masculinity in this situation. 
 Well, I let that smoke settle for a few weeks while I was at college, and when I visited over a weekend a few weeks later, she began to question me after I made a comment about just wanting a simple courthouse wedding one day and a background BBQ. (My older brother's big wedding drama talk triggered my comment) 
 Well, mom says, ""A courthouse is not a MASS."" I just respond, ""I know."" and move on. (Side note: I have not told her that I am an Athiest. She believes that I am still going to Mass at school. It is not a discussion I want to have with her at the moment, because I don't need her crying herself to sleep and worrying herself sick more than she already is right now. But I think she is slowly realizing that something is not right.) 
 So out of nowhere my mom asks me if I will be living with my boyfriend ""platonically or as husband and wife"". (Her way of asking if we'll be having sex, not actually getting married). I responded, telling her ""that is a very inappropriate question and I will not answer that."" 
 She of course disagrees that is it inappropriate. She says she needs to know, and asks again. I laugh and tell her that No, you don't need to know and you shouldn't even be asking. It. Is. Inappropriate. 
 Side note again. (Sorry) She has worked her butt off to raise us as good Catholics. My brothers are doing everything right so far, and I am the black sheep. She feels that she messed up her life really badly, and she doesn't want her children to go through what she did. So being good Catholics was a foolproof way to ensure our future happiness, in my mother's eyes. End side note. 
 Mom then goes on to ask if (boyfriend) ""respects who we raised you to be"" in regards to physical things, and I kept having to repeat myself, saying, ""I do not have to discuss this with you"". 
 She went on to say that my brothers tell her everything that they do or have done with their girlfriends, and that she wasn't mad at them, and that they all cried together and moved forward. (Some sort of weird confession thing? Idk). I told her that I don't agree that that is normal, and that I am not my brothers. Just because my brothers tell her things, doesn't make it okay or normal. 
 She also asked if (boyfriend's) mom knew that I never wanted children. (Boyfriend is an only child, and we are both childfree. I have been sterilized already, unbeknownst to my mother). I responded, "" Does she know the state of my uterus? No."" Apparently ""uterus"" is a dirty word because mom didn't like that I said it. She then went on to say that (boyfriend's mom) ""needed to know soon"". I laughed and said that she absolutely did not, and that was entirely between (boyfriend) and I to discuss whether we will ever tell her and when if at all. It's like she wanted a reason for (boyfriend's mom) to dislike me and drive us apart. She didn't agree (of course) that it wasn't her business to know, seeing that she (mom) feels that our sex life should be her business. Goodness gracious. 
 I could go on and on, but that is the long and short of it. Welcome to having an adult child, mother. 
 TL;DR: I set boundaries on my sex life information with my MOTHER and she acts like I'm the only one in the world doing this and I am rejecting the ""mother-daughter bond"" and keeping her at arms length.";22;F;TRUE;FALSE
"I'm 27m, she's 23f. 
 Relationship backstory... 
 Basically, about 2 months after I moved overseas we met and ended up seeing each other for about 4-5 months, non-exclusively. We both hooked up with other people, it all quite casual. Even had the ""are you sure you're cool with this?"" chat with no problems at all. Eventually I realised we weren't ever going to be together properly and told her we had to stop. We had a really intense night talking about it, and just having honest chats with each other, and a part of me was like ""I haven't seen this side of her before, it feels like we've just clicked"". We drunkenly slept together that night and made the decision in the morning to give it at least a week of no contact to collect our recently changed thoughts and then meet up. So we met up a week or so later and start seeing each other with the intent to see how it goes. 
 Fast forward 5 months and we've been in a relationship for about 3-4 of those (started non-exclusive, but quickly turned into exclusive, relationship). I was happy, but slowly the thought that I wouldn't ever fall properly in love with her came back with a vengeance and it reached a point where I knew I had to break it off. I ended up panicking one night soon after that and breaking it off in the heat of the moment. I think it was a fight or flight response - I'd previously been in a 3.5 year relationship where the last year was spent with me knowing I didn't want to spend the rest of my life with her, but trying to change my mind and my heart. So I think this panic was caused by me not wanting to repeat that, to not waste her time like my last gf, or find myself trapped in a relationship where the love had gone again. 
 She never saw it coming, and was completely torn apart. She told me she'd just fallen in love with me - I had no idea, things had actually been a little off somehow for the past 2 weeks. She quickly turned into intense hate, before I got a chance to explain myself and talk about it. After a few days of nastiness through text messages, with her rejecting any efforts to meet up or talk, or any explanation I'd try to offer, she starts the proper no contact. This was 5 weeks ago. I honoured her intentions of no contact, but when the opportunity came to reply to an email of hers I took it and tried to explain the break up and how horrible I feel about it all. This happened a few times. It's still quite volatile, and probably will be for a long time.. Even still, up until now I never once regretted the decision to break up with her. 
 Fast forward through the horrible guilt and all of that, and I'm about to fly back to my home country to visit family. I get a txt from her saying to have a safe flight, and tells me to say hi to the family dog for her (she's never met him, but always wanted to). This got me thinking about her again, instead of the breakup guilt that has been all I could think about until now, and I spend the flight basically realising how strong my feelings for her are, how much I miss her, and how right we are for each other. We literally never had a problem, fight, incompatibility or anything that would normally cause a break up. We've got such similar taste in music, humour, art, all things really but with differences that weren't incompatible at all but rather curious and interesting. Literally the only problem was this feeling that I wouldn't fall in love with her, but I don't know where that comes from. My best female friend says that she got the impression that it was just a comfort thing, and that we're compatible enough to work but not compatible enough for a more serious relationship. But right now I don't know what to think. 
 I think I broke things off before I gave it a chance to turn into something, and at the same time a part of me never wanted it to turn into anything. I was firmly in a place of fun when I moved and a relationship was the last thing I wanted (her too, she'd just split with her 2 year ex at the time). But right now I'm feeling otherwise, quite strongly, and I'm really unsure what to do. How do I know that what I'm feeling now is true, and not just me missing her or wanting female companionship, or wanting to just fix things somehow? At what stage do I go ""right, that's it"" and try and dismiss these thoughts and move on? And the worst thing, if this is genuine, how can I turn around and try and get back together with her after totally devastating her like this?

"This is not an argument over what is a fair trade for Love. 
 I've just heard over and over again it is impossible to sign Love without the Wolves help. 
 I'm looking strictly at the numbers IF the Cavs mainly wanted to sign Love in the offseason and kept Wiggins provided Love wants to join. 
 I'm not great with the salary cap stuff so please let me know where I am going wrong. 
 Cavs salary for 2016: 
 Lebron- 21.6M [link for Lebron and Wiggins]( 
 Wiggins- 5.75M 
 Irving- (90M/5 Year) = 18M? Hoopshype doesn't have the data out so not sure about this one. I just took the 90 Million max number divided by number of years. I think the 90M only happens if he wins MVP or something? So the number could be lower than this potentially. 
 Kevin Love- 18.98M [link if he opts out re-signs outside Minny]( 
 The only other guy on the roster is Joe Harris for 800k 
 Projected Salary Cap for 2016 is 66.5M [link]( 
 66.5 (Salary Cap) -21.6 (Lebron)-5.75(Wiggins)- 18 (Irving) - 18.98 (Love) -.8 (Harris) = 1.37 Million left over after Lebron, Wiggins, Love, Irving, Harris. 
 
 EDIT: With only 4 players signed. There would be 8 cap holds equivalent to the rookie scale ($473,604). With this in mind 
 So for instance taking Love out of the equation and assuming no team options are picked up.
So let's take the scenario without Love.
66.5 (salary cap) - 21.6 (Lebron) -5.75 (Wiggins) - 18 (Irving) -.8 (Harris) = 20.35 Million left before Love.
I found a quote about cap holds  link . This charge is equal to the rookie minimum salary for each player fewer than 12."" 
 12- 4 players = 8 X 473,604 (rookie minimum salary cap holds) = 3.31M 
 20.35 -3.31M = 17.04 M left for Love. That is under his 18.98 max but I also kind of guessed high on Kyrie.
So under this scenario Love would get about 1M less than his max for his first year 
 
 EDIT2: This may be the dealbreaker. Team options have to be picked up by October 31 (Bennett, Waiters). So basically the Cavs have to take a huge leap of faith and not pick up the team options on Bennett and Waiters if they wanted to try to get Love in the off-season. Credit for u/TomothyWTF for this bit of knowledge. Waiters and Bennett are too valuable to not pick up their team options without anything guaranteed. 
 
 EDIT3: Forgot Mike Miller who will make 2.7M next year and 2.8M the following. 
 So 17.04M - 2.8M + .473k = 14.97M for Love assuming Waiters and Bennett's team options aren't picked up. 
 
 EDIT4: So before I was approximating Kyrie to be 18M year just dividing his 90M/5 years. Now that the numbers are so close to the limit I wanted to see if I could find something more realistic than 90M divided evenly by 5. 
 Using Paul George's 5 year/90M contract as a template. That Kyrie's 1st year could look something like 15.8M in the first year (what PG is getting in year 1). [link]( 
 Previously I had Kyrie down for 18M. 18-15.8=2.2M extra from my previous calculations. 14.97+2.2= 17.17M left over for Love adjusting for salary cap holds. Also this is assuming Bennett and Waiters team options are picked up and can be moved via trade (Similar to what the Rockets did with Asik and Lin this offseason). 
 TL;DR - My final best guest scenario (adjusting for cap holds, readjusted for Mike Miller's contract, assuming Waiters and Bennett can be moved ala Asik and Lin last year, assuming Kyrie's first year of his 5/90M looks similar to Paul George's). Cavs can keep Lebron, Irving, Wiggins, Miller and sign Love with about  17.17M  the first year which is less than his  18.98M max 
 Conclusion: I think it is possible for the Cavs to sign Love. They 17.17M is close to the max. If the Cavs can move Joe Harris's contract it could open up another 400k for Love. 
 This is not to say this is the best team the Cavs can field. Trading with Minnesota is probably the much better option. This was just an exercise in learning about the CBA for me. Thanks everyone for the feedback and critique.";75;M;FALSE;FALSE
"Me and Matt were together for nearly 2 years and I was completely in love with him. We broke up nearly 2 years ago after I found out he had cheated on me with a friend. A month or so after we broke up he was in a relationship with the girl he cheated on me with. This new relationship of his only lasted 6 months or so since then he has been single. 
 Since then I entered a new relationship with Rich [23 M] and I am now 25 weeks pregnant with Rich's child, however that relationship broke down, but we are still friends and Rich is stepping up to his responsibilities. 
 Then a couple of days ago Matt confessed to me that he made a massive mistake by cheating on me and he still loves me and wants to get back with me. He actually showed genuine remorse for what he did. So I told him I'd have to think about it because I don't know what to do because yes I do still love him but he cheated on me and hurt me and because he's cheated once there is always the possibility that he will do so again and I also have my pregnancy to think about. 
 He said he understands that I come as two people now and that he will be there for me and my baby. But I just don't know why it has taken him this long to admit these feelings because he's had well over a year to do it. 
 Idk whether I should forgive him for what he did or not because I will soon have responsibilities as a parent and idk if he will actually accept me and the baby even tho he says he will. Its just difficult because I do have strong feelings for him but I just don't want to be hurt again. 
 Should I forgive him or not??????

"It's the second situation. Apparently, on average it should take about 50m worth of ships and fits (not much) to blow up an Industrial class ship. If the industrial drops less than 50m, the attackers lost money on the deal and so it wouldn't be worth it. Since you typically drop 50% of your carried cargo (though the loot fairy is PMSing sometimes), anything over 100m  should  be profitable for them, maybe even a little lower if they somehow know you've got an expensive fit. 
 This same rule goes for Freighter class ships, but the line for them is 1b ISK because their shell is so much thicker. This is why Red Frog Freight has a 1b ISK hard limit on their shipping services for a single load: too risky otherwise.

"So I'm 32m near a major city in the US. Me and my wife of nearly a decade have moved into a poly relationship. This was a mutual decision after we experienced first hand the obvious difficulties of creating a triad from nothing. 
 We both have profiles on OKC and as expected she is getting hit up constantly. Both guys and girls are taking her out and she is having a great time. I'm honestly happy that she is enjoying this experience, but I'm far from it. 
 Everyone I've contacted has either not written me back or flat out refuses this type of relationship. I'll point out that I'm only contacting women who have some indication on their profile that they are open to the idea of poly. I will also say and will probably be told on here that it is wayyyyy too early to begin being depressed about the lack of options. We've officially been looking for two weeks. I just feel like I've expended my potential options on OKC without driving some unreasonable distance to meet someone. 
 We've both agreed that either of us can pull the plug at anytime. But doing so now will mean that she is hurt and I can't say that will make me feel any better. 
 I'm definitely envious of the attention she has received. I don't know how to cope with it. For whatever reason this has impacted my work, school, and home life with my family. The only person I can talk to about it is my wife. She is very supportive. 
 Any advice to help get over the near constant depression that seems to plague me at the moment?

"Me (26F) him, (27m)- throwaway account since we are both redditors. We have been going out since August 2010. We did break up once for 8 weeks in February 2011 and then got back together, due to the same fighting pattern - I will describe below. 
 Basically, my boyfriend and I keep having the same fight over and over and I need to know whether or not it is worth it to keep going or if I should just cut my losses. I love him so much but all of our fights usually end with him and I not speaking for a few days, I get so angry that he won't speak to me, give in first and communicate/call - and then we resolve things with him saying he will try to work on things. Here is the thing- its not really improving. Also, I have told him how hurt it makes me when he cuts all communication after a fight and refuses to talk to me. It hurts like crazy and it makes me feel like he doesn't care at all about me. He agrees it wasn't the best approach, but he does it over and over again. I love this person with all my heart but, at the end of the day - if its wrong to expect someone to change- should I just cut my losses and move on? 
 For a long time now, I have had issues with my boyfriend refusing to do social things with me, whether its going out to a movie, going to socialize with my friends or family, etc. Because of this, and despite the rest of our relationship being great imo, my friends and family still don't know him very well and I get more and more resentful that my boyfriend won't be ""normal"" and do social things with me. 
 Keep in mind, I am a homebody and am more often than not satisfied with staying in, watching him play games, watching a show, etc. 
 He also has social anxiety (physical signs of which I've seen including sweaty palms, nervousness), and I know that this is part of the problem - but I also thing that if he gets to know my friends and family, they will no longer feel like strangers and he will therefore be more comfortable around them - maybe even making some new friends. 
 My boyfriend and I got in a big fight the other day because I suggested wanting to go see a movie on a Saturday night. He told me he had too much studying to do- which was funny, since we had had plans to go to a movie with his friend before - but it was cancelled, and he was totally willing to spend his time/money with his friend but not just with me. 
 His excuses range from school work, getting up early for work, not having money (although I offer to cover him enough), or just being too tired. In my opinion, he is making up excuses to avoid having to go out anywhere with me. 
 When I ask him why he is okay to go out drinking with his friends during the week, he gets angry and says that he sacrifices so much of his social time to be with me instead - but always avoids my point that his social anxiety is not stopping him from going out other times. 
 Then there is the way our fights always go- I wait for him to call or text me - for 48 hours or longer he doesn't - then when I finally give in, contact him - extremely angry and hurt- he goes on the defensive - making me feel like I am overreacting. 
 Eventually - I wonder why- I let things go when he promises to work on this. But, its like pulling teeth every.single.time I don't want to sit on a couch. 
 Reddit- what do I do? I truly believe that he loves me, and we have a great relationship and I love being with him when we don't have this problem, but I am a 26 year old woman who wants to start thinking about marriage and kids by the time I am 30. Another thing is he recently told me he's not sure he wants kids, but he will let me know when he's sure so I don't ""Waste my childbearing years"". 
 I am so torn. It seems like an easy decision but its not. How can I get him to understand that 
a) his fighting etiquette is unacceptable and it needs to stop
b) hanging out with my friends and family is necessary if he wants to be in a relationship with me, and also that it is necessary for MOST people. 
 Thank you for any insight or advice, 
 TL; DR  *I love my boyfriend and we have a great relationship, except when I suggest going out and being social, then he comes up with bullshit excuses and then ignores me and gives me the silent treatment until I give in and try to resolve things like adults. What do I do to get through to him or am I wasting my time?** 
 EDIT -  UPDATE :  Spoke to my boyfriend last night, after leaving him 2 calls and a text. He told me that he texted me 3 hours after our fight on Sat - therefore trying NOT to give me the silent treatment. I never received this text. He re-sent it right away. Since I haven't seen his phone, I can't check when the text was originally sent- but I am compelled to believe him that he did send me one. Second, I told him what I needed. I need for him to go out with me when I ask him to, whether its myself, or friends and family. He explained that the problem is twofold: He does not enjoy going out and being social. He doesn't see the value/need of this. However, he has told me in the past that for me, he is  willing* to do it, because he knows it is important to me. Second, since we have dated he has had limited income, as a student living on his own and working a retail job part time. He explained that this strain further adds to the desire to stay home. I never understood this because I also worked and went to university and still made time for friends. That being said, I am more extroverted than he is. He graduates in three weeks, and feels like he would be more open to going out when he is working full time and has more expendible income. I argued that if it's not school/money, it will be something else- like being ""too tired"" after work. He says this isn't the case (I am very skeptical). We ended the conversation with him saying that he is also tired of this fight, and of me ""nagging"", and maybe it is time we thought about moving on. We are both going to take time to think about whether we should continue the relationship. For me, it is also a major fact that he's decided he doesn't want to have kids, and if we do end up breaking up, it would be more this issue than anything, but as others have said, him refusing to do these things with me consistently throughout the relationship has left me very resentful. We both expressed the desire to not break up, but, I am at least relieved that he is taking this seriously. Thank you all for your comments/help.**";26;F;TRUE;FALSE
"First of all sorry for my English. it is not my first language.

 This start like one month ago when I went to a shop to to have some work done, I had never previously enter that shop because they do a very specific kind of job and I din't need it and really I don't have any more excuses to go inside. Also this shop is really small its only her and her boss. I went 3 or 4 times because of the work I needed, once she was alone, other they were both and other the boss was alone. 
 There I met this girl that is doing an internship and I really kinda like her (also i don't event know her name), it's like I have a crush on her and I have been thinking on her for this month. I don't want to go inside and be like: Hi sorry to come to your work place and can I have your number to maybe go drink something. there also the possibility that if I go inside I'll met her boss an be like: Hi, ho shes not here. and ask her boss about her name and maybe her phone number? 
 I know this shop is going to close soon, like before next week maybe, and more likely she will end her internship at this date. I have been trying to met her casually on the street but it seems that I have never been in the good place at the good moment. Monday I saw her went Went inside a store near her work place. I was waiting in the cashier line ans comes, ask the person before me and grab something from the shelf. , she was leaving and I froze. I saw her fade away. Later I was like: you moron, you should have said something.  I think this week might be my last chance.

"alright here's the rundown. I'm 16 [M] and about 3 weeks ago I broke up with my girl friend of 3 months[16 F]. I have posted about her before. At first, I thought that we could just be friends and then I realized that I couldn't even stand her personality anymore. She was annoying and immature and I definitely didn't see that relationship going anywhere in the future. Another reason is because I kind of started talking to someone else. One of my best bro's (Which is a year older than me, a senior in high school. Not that that matters.) Has a sister that is 14 in 9th grade. She goes to a different school than I do but she goes to my school after 3:00 everyday. Anyways, after talking to her for the past three weeks like NON STOP I finally asked her out and one of her friends told me before hand that she knew she would say yes because she had been liking me since the beginning of the summer. So now is 2 days after I have asked her out. My first girlfriend still isn't over me and I see her crying at band practice sometimes (Highschool marching band. And so is my new girlfriend which actually plays the same instrument as me). Another issue is the age difference might not seem like a big deal to most people but her dad (which is my bestfriends dad so I already know him) is extremely strict and frankly quite scary. And from all the previous times I have hung out with my friend I kind of have the feeling that he thinks I'm a dumbass. The bottom line is I don't know if he would be ok with us dating. My new girlfriend has never done anything before and I'm her first real 'boyfriend'. Me, her, and my previous girlfriend have ALLOT of friend connections (I live in a pretty small town). I know this post is kind of vague but I'm just gonna ask... what now? 
 We have only told my friend (her brother), and he's ok with it, and we've also told her best friend but she can keep a secret which is okay. So what should I do? I don't really want her parents to know that we're dating unless I know they would be okay with us dating. And I'm afraid if news got back to my old girlfriend it would completely destroy her, also making me seem like an insensitive prick that moved on way to fast. which... I don't know... I might have. and also, I don't really know how I can hang out with my girlfriend that easily. We used to just hang out at band practice all the time (she's in the band with us... the school system is weird) but now that football season is coming to a close, there is no more of that. How can I hang out with her without giving it away that we're dating to her parents? and also... How fast is too fast. She said she's ok with moving as fast as I want to. I don't really know what a regular speed is though... With my ex girlfriend we kissed the first week we started dating. Which actually seems kind of fast to me. But I want to do what will be best for both of us. It might not seem like I'm asking a specific question in this giant clusterfuck of information. But my main question  is... What now? 
 TLDR; I have a new girlfriend, and I just broke up with my previous one 3 weeks ago. Should I wait to tell? And, How fast should my new relationship be going?";16;F;FALSE;FALSE

Christianity is stress and emotional abuse disguised as comfort and happiness. It preaches freedom when in reality it's servitude. 
 I ""struggled"" with masturbation. I died inside every time. I became numb as I got older but the guilt was still there. I was given the impression that girls were never going to be interested in me. 
 Throughout my teen years, I was resigned to a life of no sexual contact, and denying my emotions towards girls, and my sexual urges. 
 To paraphrase something I read on another post to this subreddit... Under the tyranny of stupidianity, Making any kind of sexual advance to an otherwise consenting partner means that both partners should break up. Because a good partner will wait until marriage.

 I've lived nearby to my cousins and aunt [23m, 27f, 60f], but have become more distant with the cousins in the recent years. My cousins have changed quite a bit to fit in the 'popular scene' whereas me and brothers do not quite feel so comfortable as they have been subjected to racial slurs, and we all have moved away to larger cities and experienced different cultures for work/university (since moved back). 
 My cousin [27f] has slowly been developing a superior complex and I've heard from other family members of her using discriminatory words to define people (""Indian people are dirty/smelly). Her brother [23m] is somewhat 'chavvy' (drugs, cheating, fights) and is in the forces. Ever since he joined I get the feeling he has become racist. Such as liking anti-muslim things and first Britain stuff on facebook. They both go on about how much they love their family, the male cousin gives lots of hugs (might be a dominance thing), they are nice to us, but I know they are racists. They have no non-white friends, or know any non-white people. I know they see me and my brothers as white rather than mixed race. With the elections coming up, I know they are voting for UKIP (a known 'covert' racist party), they seem very vocal on muslim-related incidents (more the most) and say that immigrants stealing benefits/jobs is a major problem (Its much smaller than they think it is). 
 I don't really know how I should think of them when they haven't openly 'wronged me'. But I feel very betrayed and offended, I know they hate muslims, and are not fond of black or asians. Should I just accept them for their beliefs? Should I completely avoid them? Should I wait until they make a racist comment then avoid them? I feel like I'm waiting for them to say something discriminatory so I can cut them them out of my lives but I feel like its over the top. 
 tl;dr: My cousins are covertly bigoted and racist but have not wronged me - yet. How should I handle them";23;m;FALSE;FALSE
"This is going to be long and venty, but bear with me. 
 Just over 3 years ago, I (24f) moved out of my parents' place and to the other side of the country for school. I grew up in the bay area in California, and now I live in a completely wonderful midwestern city. I graduated last year and failed to find a job in my field, however, I've fallen into a managerial role in a completely wonderful independent coffee roaster and I love my job so much! I love my customers and my coworkers and my superiors, I love the culture and the camaraderie, and the pay isn't bad either. All of these things were missing from my last job. I've recently learned that my boss is planning on grooming me for his position, which would mean further possible growth within the company, and I've talked to the owners about possibly redoing the training material for the whole company, which would be a boost for my ultimate goal of a career in technical writing. All in all, for what it is, my job is really great and I can see myself sticking around for a long time. 
 In addition to this wonderful job, I have a wonderful fiance (32m) that I have been living with for over two years. He is literally as perfect for me as a guy could be; we have great sexual chemistry, similar goals and interests and ideologies. He's smart and sexy and fun as hell, he's my rock and my best friend and this post is not about our relationship, it's about his job. 
 A year ago when I was stuck in a job I hated, he was approached by Amazon for an interview. When we talked about relocating then, I was all for it. I've already done it once and I know how I reacted in that situation. It seemed like an incredible opportunity for adventure and we'd be closer to my family (albeit still 1500 miles away), we have friends in Seattle, and we've visited it together and already know we like it. He didn't end up getting the offer because of his school situation, but he did just get a big promotion and upgrade from contractor to employee at a different but lower tier major company earlier this week. But now one year later, the opportunity to work for Amazon has arisen again, and they are flying him out next week for an interview. 
 I am SO excited for him, and I think there is more than a chance that things will go this direction. He's charming and charismatic and good at his job, I have no doubt he will make a great impression. This is a really game changing opportunity for him and for us, but it's terrible timing for ME, and I feel really selfish for feeling that way. I am excited about every part of this except finding a new job. There is no question of this breaking us up, as realistically my job is not a career as such, and his could probably support a frugal lifestyle for the two of us until I got established. However, I've got about $600 in various loan payments each month to think of, and the thought of him supporting me until I find what may very well be a much worse job than I have here is completely unappealing. He has been completely supportive of my fears, and we're trying not to get ahead of ourselves, but how can I come to terms with essentially housewifing it until I can find a job? I have a Bachelor's in English and a lot of retail and managerial experience, but I'm afraid I'll be stuck working another job I absolutely can't stand because I need to pay my bills. 
 Has anyone been in this situation that can offer any advice? I'm worried about the resentment that could come from this from both sides. I don't want to end up hating him because I missed out, and I don't want him to resent having to pay my way if it comes to that, but on the flip side, it's not as if Seattle isn't known for its coffee scene. It is possible that I could leverage my current position at my actually pretty influential company to find me something new. Other possibilities include my going back to school and deferring my loans while I get my Master's, which has always been on my mind anyway, but this is only sustainable if I can find a program that will fund me. I can also let him move first and follow him when I find something, but finding jobs that I'm qualified for without being about to interview in person will be incredibly difficult. We will find out if he gets the offer in December, I'd like to be out of my own head by then and just be able to get excited about whichever way this goes. 
 TL;DR: My fiance has an amazing job offer and I'm super excited for him, but I love my job. How do I feel better about leaving a job I love for an opportunity that will be wonderful for us in the long-term? If he gets this offer, we are moving. This is not a move/don't move situation.";24;f;TRUE;FALSE
"I (21M) know a couple of people in my university course and I believe their behaviour is borderline creepy and stalker-ish ( that's subjective I suppose) and I can't understand how they seem to successfully be so close to some girls. 
 I'll explain: The most successful one, who we'll call Paul, is quite a nice and funny guy but also quite the stereotypical nerd... asthma, never had a gf, really smart skinny guy etc. etc. (I apologise for stepping on anyone's toes I just think it's important to build the picture!). 
 So Paul is after two girls, one is my ex and the other is just another classmate, this is some of what he does: 
 
 He messages both girls every day, without fail... and never ever let's the conversation die, or then just starts a new one. 
 
 He waits behind classes sometimes hours just to walk one of them to the train station 
 
 He's asked both out multiple times each and got rejected every time, but still persists on being there all the time for both of them 
 
 Goes above and beyond helping them with their assignments, including doing coursework that he didn't need to do (and doesn't even slightly tell the other guys any answers) 
 
 Follows them (mostly the ex these days) about literally everywhere every day... or texts her asking where she is often. 
 
 
 Also I feel like it's somewhat relevant to mention the ex has a new bf and yet he still continues... and she's also told me she found him creepy at one point. 
 Now maybe I'm just being very ignorant about something here idk... but both girls still seem like they like to be around Paul, they laugh  a lot  (He is pretty funny after all), and from what I've heard and seen they answer all his text messages and seem to like being 'semi-stalked' (imo). 
 Seeing this daily has started to wear down my beliefs that relationships and friendships should be built on ~ 50/50! I see him with one of them giggling away all the time and it feels like I'm somehow the one in the wrong! 
 So: 
 Is Pauls kind of behaviour normal or a good way at getting closer to girls?  He's very close to both of them with his persistence, and despite being rejected by both that could just be down to more... physical appearances... 
 Thanks for reading! 
 tl;dr : I don't understand why some girls seem to like behaviour that I, themselves, and some other people have deemed weird and/or creepy... and yet the guy in question still seems to be closer to them than any other. 
 And this has me questioning if this persistence is normal/good.

"We started being intimate a few months after we began dating three years ago, and it was fantastic. We were intimate often, and both of us enjoyed it, and it was a healthy addition to our relationship. But as of recently, I've experienced some strange things. I enjoy thinking about us being intimate, I enjoy stimulation, but when it comes to him being intimate with me, I clam up and begin to have a panic attack. I don't know what's wrong with me.

"Hello again, and welcome to part 3. This one should be short and sweet. The album where all my relevant battery historian stats are is available [here]( 
 Here's what I did:  Turned LTE On, Turned WiFi Off, Turned ""Always on"" ""Ok Google"" detection Off, Synced all accounts (in addition to the changes I made in previous posts, ie. Google Now Launcher/Google Now/Now Cards/Now on Tap off). I said I would turn off Google Location History but I didn't do it! I couldn't convince myself that I could live without it. Phone went from 100% Full to 9% over the period of 25 hours. 
 What I noticed: 
 
 my phone Doze-d well overnight on LTE (lost ~4%, see graph)  
 it attempted to Doze throughout the day (see graph) 
 screen off discharge rate was higher but not drastically so (1.42 vs 1.80) 
 screen on time was a comparable ~3h (3h39m last test) 
 screen off uptime  decreased significantly  from  5h24m to 2h7m ! (lower is better) 
 userspace wakelock time  decreased significantly  from  2h24m to 1h24m ! (lower is better) 
 kernel overhead time  decreased significantly  from  3h to 43m ! (lower is better) 
 wakeup reason summary saw no significant differences 
 CPU Usage per App saw no significant changes 
 userspace wakelocks saw no significant changes (stopped using pomodoro) 
 HUGE!  Kernel Wakesources saw a  huge difference. look at this [previous one]( and look at this [new one]( 
 HUGE!  CPURunning  decreased  from  8h46m  [(see Row 3 ""CPURunning"", Table 2 here)]( to **[4h55m]( 
 
 Kernel Wakesources 
 The difference is just incredible. No more wlan_rx_wake ( because WiFi is off ) and everything else also went way down. The longest duration is bluesleep and that's because I streamed music to my car from my phone for a total of ~1 hour. 
 CPURunning stats 
 While CPU Usage per App did not change significantly. What did change is CPU System Time by apps. ANDROID_SYSTEM used a total of ~27m compared to the previous ~1h. ROOT used ~1h compared to the previous ~1.5h. 
 Lastly,  phone and wifi signal strength:  wifi was off for 25h15m and I relied solely on LTE for the test. 11h49m of moderate signal, 9h33m of good signal, 3h37m of great signal and so on. The signal isn't great at my house (it's moderate). I didn't use WiFi on my phone for 25h15m and that's just not possible for some (especially ones with low or no data plans, I used 0.34 GB of data during this test) users. 
 In conclusion , I turned off a lot of shit. Some of it I didn't need or use often enough to care (like Google Now/Now Cards/Google Now Launcher/Now on Tap/""Always ON"" ""Ok Google"" detection)... but WiFi I need . Therefore, while turning off WiFi (and actually unnecessary things) seems to have drastically helped with my battery life, I don't recommend it unless you're on some grandfathered unlimited data plan, have great signal coverage, and don't need WiFi. 
 I'm curious as to whether other people running their devices on WiFi are also noticing the same wakelocks. If so, I'd say there's some room for Google to look into them and figure out why they exist and how they can be better handled. In the end, my Nexus 6P is still my favourite phone and will hopefully stay by my side for the next 2-3 years (at least). 
 If  you're into tinkering around with your Nexus (isn't that why we're Android users?), rooting your device and disabling wlan_rx_wake and other WiFi related wakelocks should help a lot! I might look into this! 
 TL;DR: 
 
 Turned off a lot of shit  
 Turning off WiFi seems to have gotten rid of a lot of wakelocks  
 Not ideal unless you don't need WiFi on your 6P

"I feel your pain OP.  I've been a GM/Officer/Raid Leader off and on for the better part of the last two years in various states of progression.  Most weeks its not so bad, as people at least start to understand that progressing means wiping over and over as long as you're at least making  some  progress towards that next goal. 
 And then there are those  special  weeks where you get that sense of dread that nothing's going to go right.  We just had one this week.  The raid group had been wanting to push more HM content but had been basically incapable of sustaining the DPS required.  Myself and the other officers had set up two possible options for the raid group:  a)  Keep the 25 man roster and make a 10 man HC progression team (with the 10 man's alts filling in the empty spots in the 25 man..so basically no alt geared enough for 1/7 7/7 or no spot) or b)  Do 25m hard modes. 
 Personally I was in favor of option c) just farm out what we have on farm til Dragon Soul so I can get my raid leading duties set up and taken care of so come patch day we don't have our pants around our ankles. 
 The people who would've made up the 10 man HC group were fine with option A but enough people raised a stink about option B that the officers (myself included) decided to give them exactly what they wanted on the grounds that for us to go back to any bosses we had on farm that they had to kill at least one new boss. 
 Tuesday was HM Rhyolith and we had 3 hours of attempts that were so far from even being  close  that its hard to call them attempts.  Hitting the 5 minute mark with Rhyo still at ~60%; people dying to the magma lines from downed volcanos; liquid obsidum not being slowed.  Just a general fuckfest.   3 healers and 2 dps gquit citing that they didn't want to do ""hardcore progression."" 
 Wednesday- Since Rhyolith was such an  AMAZING  success, we decided to give the raid some more rope to hang itself with by going to HM Aly.  3 hours, and only one attempt did we get to the 2nd air phase.  Had tanks dying to lava spew, dps dying to lava spew, tanks and dps dying to the meteors, people not getting behind the meteors we did kill to avoid firestorm. 
 Thursday- Thankfully no more gquits but we did have a few ""cat is on fire"" dps for normal mode clear + hm shannox (supposedly).  Killed Beth no problems (well, minimal problems); killed Alysrazor on the first ground phase; Killed Rhyolith in like 3 minutes; spawned Shannox & 2-shot Baleroc (first wipe was because people got a case of the full-blown retard wrt shard soaking and tank healing).   And then there came HM Shannox.  4 wipes of incomprehensible levels of failure later we kill him on normal and move on to Staghelm (who's also on long-time farm)....or should have been.  Apparently ""Stack up"" and ""Spread out"" are exceptionally difficult concepts to grasp, and even harder when the stack/spread times are dictated before the pull and then counted down during the fight.  ""The specials order is going to be 11-7-5-5"" and ""Spread in 3 slashes...Spread in 2 slashes....spread after this slash.....Spread now"" (similar instructions for cat phase).  Somehow, in spite of ourselves we managed to clear out the rest of the instance (we got over our derps on domo and the  THREE  wipes to rag trash) to 3 shot rag. 
 Basically the TL;DR of my story is rough weeks happen, but you have to just power through 'em no matter how rough.  The harder things get, depending on how quickly you plowed through the previous tier, the more resistance your raid group is going to put up if they're relatively new to raiding.  And sometimes, you have to just give the raid group enough rope to hang themselves and be amused when they fuck it up so badly that they've managed to wind up hanging by a rib they've miraculously managed to get outside their skin.";25;m;FALSE;FALSE
"Little backstory here, I (18M) am absolutely horrific with the opposite gender. I have never been good reading hints from women and have a low self esteem. 
 Anyways me and one of my buddy's were hanging out in my car yesterday at the local meet-up spot. And this girl; one of my cousins friends,  (16F) who I have known for about 2 months now and gotten to know pretty well, walks over to my car and gets in the backseat. 
 We were just chatting when my buddy got out of my car to grab something from his car. She climbs over the seat and into the passenger seat. It seemed like she was flirting with me. She then grabs my phone and starts to take about 40 selfies on it. 
 Fast forward about an hour of chatting and potential flirting when she asks me if I have a ""babe"". I replied no and she kept on prying, and even asking my buddy. I mean like really prying. She then asks if she is my ""babe"" (somewhat jokingly, I think). I got all red faced and embarrassed and quickly replied no.

"So, I am still struggling with the same issue I posted about a week ago (tried to hyperlink it, but was told this was violating rules...if you want to read the full post just click my name. It's titled ""Me [24 F] with my BF [24 M], having trouble dealing with his relationship with EX""). 
 My [24f] boyfriend [24m] of 5 months, has a close relationship with his ex [24f] that bothers me after seeing some ""intimate"" texts between the two. Texts about missing each other and passion and other things you SHOULD NOT be sharing with an ex while you're in a relationship. He has been defending that they were perceived incorrectly and that he only wants to be with me, and has no interest in being with her outside of friendship. 
 We have had many conversations since. He has cut down contact with her to about once a day, sometimes skipping days. She usually messages him some unimportant stuff about her life (related to her cats, mutual acquaintances, memes, video games). He replies to her message, and then their conversation ends there. 
 This is not enough and I wish he would just see how much their contact is hurting our relationship, and stop. It makes me question whether or not I should stay. I have told him this, and he seemed very upset. He told me if i was going to make him choose between her and me, he would choose me. I do not want to MAKE him do anything. I just wish he would choose to stop his contact with her voluntarily. 
 I have considered an ultimatum. End contact with her, or I'm done, because I do not feel respected and valued if he continues a relationship with her platonic or not. I feel like he is choosing his/her feelings over mine. If the situation were reversed, it would suck, but I would cut contact. It's not worth losing someone who I really like being with. 
 Please share your stories with ultimatums. Have you had a boyfriend/girlfriend issue one to you? What did you do?

"I (17F) know that if I am ever going to be able to get over him, that I would have to cut off all contact. We have tried hanging out together but it is much too uncomfortable for me to do that. I am just not ready to develop any sort of friendship with him at this very moment. Eventhough I was trying to be as nice as possible to him, we ended up bashing one another over our mistakes and stupidities we did while we were together. Obviously I felt like an ass but in the end, this just made me realize that this was one of the reasons as to why we need some time apart. 
 I feel like I hurt him by doing this but to be fair, he hurt me first. In my opinion, it seems like something like this will end up benefiting the both of us as it will help the both of us heal. I made sure to assure him that, when I do feel better, I will be more than happy for us to be friends. 
 I realize that too many things were bothering me thus further preventing me from focusing on forgetting about him. For example, it has only been two months but he has already been asked out multiple times and eventhough he has said no and claims that he does not want a relationship, it still hurts me. It's silly to worry as to why people have approached him and not me but well, that's just the way it is. 
 In conclusion fellow redditors, have I done the right thing by cutting off all contact? How do I stop myself from worrying about future relationships?

"OK! Obviously a throw away here. But I really just want to hear some opinions here. Me (24M) and my SO (20F) have been dating a little less than three months. The last month have been totally sex free. I've tried talking to her, but she states that it is all her and that there's nothing she can do about her loss of libido. The first 2 months have been pretty amazing, she was willing to do anything. Lingerie, toys, everything. But then one day it just went off a cliff. 
 She has no car, and barley any money. I take her everywhere, school, work, the grocery store, everything. She even likes to plan day trips to local cities so we can do stuff together. Fine, but after 3 months of being her taxi driver I am getting annoyed. Not once has she offered any gas money or anything. Not that I am that type, but there is no consideration whatsoever. 
 She is just now being more loving and appreciative, but most of the time I feel unloved and insignificant. I've also explained this to her, and she still claims she doesn't know why. I'm not in this relationship for the sex, nor do I need it every day, but there is no passion. I try massaging her, playing with her hair, take her out to nice dinners and surprise her with things she likes, and alas! Nothing. I feel that she just lured me in so I can be her personal taxi, a trophy boyfriend to her friends and someone to be the big spoon to keep her warm at night. 
 The relationship isn't all bad, but I barley can even get a good long kiss out of her. So, finally after weeks of suffering, I decided to go to the gym, and work on myself. I am not overweight, and I've been told that I am a very attractive guy. I just want to get more muscle on me.  I am going to take more control of my life and not let myself get all down in the dumps over this shit. She is the one missing out of all the passion that I have to offer to her.

"I recently started questioning my size bra wise. I'd been wearing a 34 band for years only switching to a 32 after loosing a substantial amount of weight. I'd gained weight again but I actually love the way my body looks with a couple of extra pounds all seemingly on my chest. 
 I posted on here and had people respond, a lot of you were really nice and had some helpful pointers some were patronising either way I deleted the post in anxiety and frustration and decided to go into Bravissimo for a bra fitting. 
 I wore a 34D bra for the fitting. Knowing it didn't fit. My bravissimo lady was fantastic. At first she said the cup didn't seem so bad. I then adjusted it so the wire was actually touching my rib cage, and she said i'd need to go up. 
 She vanished for a few minutes came back. What was brilliant was she didn't tell me what sizes I was trying on. I think this actually made a huge difference. I tried on so many bras we nailed the size quite quickly but a lot were just not comfortable to wear. They dug in or didn't quite cut right. She assured me this was normal that not all bras in my size would actually work on me, we both have short torsos so had bras that sit wrong on the rib cage. Too high at the front, to low ect. I ended up as a size 30F, but the particular bra i bought comes up small so got a 30FF. 
 What I realised was that the reason mainstream shops tell women the band they need is larger than what they actually need is purely based on making sales. I tried on about 15 bras in my size before I found 'the one' (actually I ended up buying 2 in the same style. Most people aren't that committed. They see a design they want and they try on that bra. If they ask for help they are advised in a way that will guarantee a sale. Realistically If I'm trying on 34DD's which are now available as part of normal ranges is anyone going to tell me, actually you need a 30F which we don't stock. How many would even tell me to try on a 32E? (I recently bought a bra from ann summers I asked for help I was told it fit me perfectly, I now am aware of how badly it fits, the worst bit with this is she talked me through how a good bra could fit exactly as bravissimo did. She told me these things were true for the bra I had on. I was sold a Lie.) 
 So many people are wearing the wrong size I actually feel like I can't even tell people my new size. The only people who I know who I feel will get it are my plus sized ladies with massive boobs (fyi they are happy with the term plus size) who appreciate that bras aren't easy to fit anymore. We had celebratory boob rubs. It was hilarious. Just imagine us bouncing next to each other so our boobs bash together. 
 A friend of mine was a 34DD like me (prior to refit) and thinking about it now she is clearly a 30F or a 28FF. But like me has a sensitive rib cage (i get inflammation of the muscles between my ribs and she has cystic fibrosis) And i wonder wether she is wearing the wrong size because of how frequently the right size doesn't seem to fit because we've been lied to about what is a good fit. 
 I wrote previously that I knew I was a 34 band because 32 hurt and left welts. Which was true, I had the same problem with some of the 30's, but the problem isn't the size its the cut, and that is the simple truth shops aren't telling women. because if we all realised our true sizes their whole business model of sizing would be completely screwed. 
 Examples of closest sizes for me at standard shops,
 Based on the sister sizes concept. i.e 30FF - 32E - 34DD 
 
 George at asda  34DD (one bra available at 32E for £36) 
 Marks and spencer have my size 30F! but no 30FF is a cup comes up small. And very limited styles 14 in total and some are online exclusives.  
 Other marks and spencer ranges I would either have to get a 32E or 34DD depending on the style. 
 New look  32E (available in 5 styles, 4 of which are t-shirt bras) also out of experience the cups come up horrendously small so probably looking at a 34E. 
 Debenhams has a dd+ range! but a lot of the DD range don't seem to be stocked in a 30 band so 32E is the easiest to access.  
 Annsummers 32E ( if i filter out the excessive padding then there a 4 options in this size. (side note a lot of AS ranges have removable pads, so in theory I could go down a cup size and never use the pads.  
 
 Essentially Im horrendously limited. I'm tempted to go around shops and get fitted and see what they come up with. 
 On the plus side, my new bras are amazing. If i put on one of my old bras I'm really aware of how badly it fits. The new ones are just comfy and I'm not having to move the wires about constantly. :)

She is a Korean adoptee (grew up in US, was adopted when she was 6-7 months old) and has by my estimation an extremely difficult time with trust & intimacy.  Here are my observations: 
 1) I will often times find myself fielding questions from her that overtly expose the fact that she is fearful I will leave her. 
 2) I will often show affection towards her (physical, doing something for her, leaving a sweet note, etc...) that will not be reciprocated or even acknowledged. If I say something about it, she will gladly reciprocate/acknowledge, however the fact that she does not feel at all compelled to show affection back in these situations strikes me as very odd and...cold, frankly. 
 3) Anything even remotely resembling constructive feedback is met with her shutting down and looking like a sad puppy that I just kicked in the face. Conversation ends, and we must wait until sad puppy turns back into happy puppy (sometimes a few hours, sometimes a few days).  I then continue (VERY gently) providing some constructive feedback and...you guessed it...sad puppy immediately comes back.  I find this particularly odd in light of the fact that she has a Masters degree in counseling. 
 4) Some of my favorite topics of discussion (science, philosophy, politics, etc...) make her feel immediately overwhelmed and fearful.  I get the sense that she doesn't want to talk and share any opinions out of fear for providing the ""wrong"" answer...but these topics are an important part of my intellectual ""diet"", and not sharing even rudimentary conversation/ideas on these topics kills me! 
 5) She repeatedly (& unintentionally) exposes the fact that she has yet to forgive me for extremely petty things that I've already genuinely apologized for, in some cases more than once. 
 I am more than willing to elaborate on any of the above points...and i'd also like to add that I consider myself to be someone of very honest, objective, caring, and calm demeanor.  Her reactions to me really leave me scratching my head, especially when I remain calm, supportive, and focused on creating positive energy out of our interactions.  Do these strike you as red flags, or are they things that can be drastically changed as her trust & affection for me grows?  Or do I strike you as someone who is inadvertently feeding in to these issues somehow?  I've never experienced anything like this with any past friends, family, girlfriends, etc...  Any feedback would be much appreciated! ;) 
 TL;DR - My GF [28F] is a Korean adoptee, and seems to have issues relating to intimacy/trust. Are these red flags? Or simply growing pains?";28;F;FALSE;FALSE
"I'm 26m and this is the first time I've ever written about this to anyone.  For as long as I can remember I have wanted to be a girl.  I would try on clothing when I could and also fantasized about the idea of being a girl or even having certain people decide to dress me up yada yada yada.  Anytime someone tries to get close to me relationship wise I always back off and/or find an excuse because I find it very hard to believe I wont have to tell them about this part of me eventually. I love and get along with my family very much; however, this news would devastate them. Friends also I would think.  Not to mention my dream job I've found myself in somehow right out of college.  So my question is... there has to be someone else out there that knows this about themselves but chooses not to ""take the leap"". How do you deal with just keeping it to yourself?  What things do you do to help?  I want to get on with my personal life but this I'm now realizing is keeping me from doing that. 
 Right now I've only really just bought clothes online, and that's about it.  I purge myself of those too though. And even when I have just convinced myself that it wouldn't work even if I chose so; somebody will say something like ""You would've made a cute girl""... like WHO says that to a guy?? IDK, now I'm rambling...  The one thing I maybe have going for me is I live in another state now that I have a new job... so maybe that's a plus?  The ONE plus of all of this is it causes me to get in great shape because I want the clothes I buy to look great ;P 
 TLDR; What do people do to deal with being transgender but never actually getting surgery, dressing different, etc.?

"Hey all. I've recently gotten back into LU after installing it on a new computer, and instead of using my old saves, which might have worked (different version, so I dunno), I just started new. After 24 hours I only have a Naucell fully kitted out, a geared up Orca, and something like 40m credits. 
 I was planning on building Boron(?) IRE SCH factories, but the Terran don't really like me - I'm at -1. So I installed the Stolen Saturn mod, which  should  allow me to purchase them at Inanimus Zura(sp). Unfortunately, the shipyard there only gives me the option to purchase the old fashioned complex linking things - has anyone else encountered this problem, or is it just my fault? 
 If there's no way to get the mod to work, what rep do I require with the Terran to purchase SCH? I'd rather use them for supplemental income over building stations - for some annoying reason, my trade rank refuses to go above 12 or so, and on top of that, I can't find any good personnel transport missions - I remember in my old save I used to do those constantly for 2m credits + each, and they were everywhere.

"Just got into an argument with my SO 21F which was pretty much initiated by ""my mum still sleeps with me occasionally"". 
 Just to make things clear, I have 2 other siblings and she sleeps with them as well, but it's not the whole night, just around half an hour maximum. There is obviously no touching at all, back faced towards her and because I'm such a heavy sleeper, sometimes I don't even know she crawled in and out. 
 SO is a very shyish? (Don't know the word) person and won't even let her family members hug, kiss touch her at all. So when I told her about this, she got really angry and started going about how sleeping with someone should be really intimate thing that you share and that she would only sleep with one person in her life. 
 Now I understand why she's mad from her point of view, but is it wrong?

"Hi, throwaway here. I need advice/suggestions from other people who are or have been in my situation.  I've also cross posted in R/long distance (hope that's ok!). 
 I'm (f27) in a LDR with my SO (28m). We've been together for 5 years and long distance for 3. I work in a highly specialised field that takes years of training (though not one that pays especially well). He works in the creative industry and whilst has been getting steadily more work over the last 3 years, barely makes the minimum wage. 
 Last year I moved to a different country for work. I'm finding it very difficult and lonely (big city, don't know anyone): he's at home, settling in socially and finding his niche. I already feel guilty asking him to move over to stay with me. He tells me that he will be giving up a potentially lucrative career to do so. 
 However, at the moment he is earning very little and if he does move over, I will have to move flat (I need to prove I have room for him on the visa application) which in this city would bring my rent to over double what it is (and over half my pay check) and I will need to pay for food, bills etc while he 'works on his portfolio' and applies for jobs. He says it may take up to six months to find a job in his field and he refuses to take 'just any job' to help out in the meantime. 
 I'm kind of baulking at this. I understand he is ambitious: we both are, but I can't help feeling it's unfair that I get to feel guilty for taking away him away from his 'potential' career and have to take a huge hit financially until he finds another one that suits him. I have discussed this with him but it just results in him getting cross and me upset. 
 Has anyone else had an SO move to live with them and had to support them financially afterwards? How did that work out?

"Last December I was on a caving trip with a few of my friends, we had descended about 60m into the cave through various climbs and rope descents and reached the top of a really dodgy looking climb. 
 One of the group went down before me and I was slightly apprehensive about climbing down it as it was pretty exposed and had a potential fall of about 10/12 metres which would have been pretty nasty, so I decided I'd use our rope as a hand line for the climb, put one of my descending rigs on the rope as backup and started down. 
 I got about a third of the way down the first 6 metre section of the climb and the rock I was holding in my hand crumbled away, the rope chose this moment to reveal that it had been stuck under a rock and actually had a lot more play than I expected, I fell down about 4 metres to a ledge bouncing over some small ledges on my way down. I ended up lying with my face pointed straight down another 6 metre drop 
 The guy who was standing on that ledge didnt want to move me at that point (understandably) worried that I might have broken my spine and moving me would make it worse, but I wasnt overly enjoying my position face down a big drop so I wiggled my legs to show him I wasnt paralysed and he moved me out of the way 
 I spent about 30 minutes recovering and then climbed back out under my own steam through the whole cave, I was in a huge amount of pain the whole time and decided it would be best to get to a hospital to get checked out, turned out I had actually broken my spine but not in a way that could sever my spinal cord luckily.

"So I (22F) used to be in a similar situation with my BF(23) and had a very similar conversation with him. I apologize in advance for the wall of text, but we've just had such similar talks..and I want you to know the outcome of mine. 
 We met freshman year of college but didn't really think too much about the other until our junior year. I had developed a crush on him during our sophomore year but never said anything to him until I realized that my crush was much more than that. I knew he was ""the one"" before we even started dating (I'm a creep, I know). Eventually he realized he liked me too and we started dating halfway through our junior year. 
 So one night, a few months after our senior year began, he accepted a job which would require him to travel A LOT (and I was already devastated by this because it meant we wouldn't be able to spend as much time together after graduation), we were sitting in his room watching TV when one of those EHarmony commercials came up and he offhandedly mentioned, ""I think I'd use a dating site to meet people after college."" I, of course, took this to mean he didn't see a future with me beyond college and was distraught. At this point we'd only been dating about 6 months but because of our friendship before it felt like we'd been together much longer. I don't think I slept for a second that night. In the morning he got up to take a shower while I laid in bed and I couldn't handle it any more...by the time he came back into the room I was a crying mess and he had no idea what was wrong or what he did. I finally managed to say something like ""Are you going to break up with me after we graduate?"" He was kinda shocked and just said ""Oh babe, I don't know, it's just one of those things where we'll see where it goes.."" I continued saying that since he had taken this new traveling job that I thought he wouldn't want to be with me post-grad and that he had said he would use dating sites to meet people - people that weren't me. Again he said ""I didn't really mean it like that, it was a  commercial ....I just meant if I  didn't  have you I would probably use those kinds of sites. Graduation is far away, we'll just have to see where it goes."" It didn't really make me feel better, but I understood that we hadn't been dating very long and that was probably the best answer he could have given me. I was freaking out over a hypothetical future and planning way too far ahead. The conversation ended and was never mentioned again. 
 Now it could very well be that your BF actually  hasn't  thought that much about your future together, and you really shouldn't take that to mean he doesn't want/see one with you. I take his ""we'll see"" as a ""why is she asking me about this right now I don't even know what I want to have to dinner let alone know who I want to spend the rest of my life with"" rather than ""I don't want to be with you in the long run, this is just 'for fun.'"" That's just how guys think and process things and you shouldn't read that much into it right now. But that's not to say you haven't planted a seed in his mind. 
 My BF told his mother at some point after this that we were going to move in together after we graduated. I didn't even know about this until his mom let it slip around Christmas time (about 2 months after the Eharmony commercial incident) and said something about getting us a gift for 'our' place to which I said ""I don't think that's official yet..."" and she said ""Oh, I think it's pretty official."" I realized that our conversation must have gotten him thinking about our future together - and though he hadn't said anything to me yet about it, he obviously had taken the conversation to heart and decided he didn't want to break up/live without me. Fast forward a few months and I was still getting used to the idea of moving in with him post-grad (though I wasn't opposed to it, just...deciding to live with someone is a huge step in any relationship). We celebrated our year anniversary about a month and a half before graduation and moved in together the day AFTER we graduated (like literally the same weekend, we graduated on a Saturday, drove to our new apartment and moved our stuff in on Sunday). Yeah his traveling job means a lot of alone time for me, but being with him the short amount of time he is home makes everything worth it and we could not be happier. We've been living together almost 5 months now and things are amazing. 
 I don't think you should do something rash like break up or give him an ultimatum or anything like that. I feel like you should truly let your relationship play out. Since you are young, you shouldn't be worried about ""wasting time"" with him because you really do have a lot of time ahead of you. This whole conversation would be a lot different if you were in your 30s, I'm sure. If nothing else happens, and say one day you do end up breaking up, you'll have the experience under your belt. But honestly, as I said before, your BF most likely hasn't considered a future with you just because that's not how guys are wired. I definitely wasn't  expecting  my BF and I to get married at the time (but it certainly was in the back of my mind, but let's be honest, almost all girls imagine what their married lives would be like with their SO regardless if they have been dating a week or a year) and I definitely didn't expect our conversation to be the defining factor in whether or not we would be living together after college. But just the fact that it got him thinking - without me even realizing it - was a huge deal. You have probably, if nothing else, gotten him thinking. Men, while they don't necessarily think far into the future, are effected by what you say and do take it into consideration regardless if they never mention it again. At the very least you have gotten the wheels in his head turning, you just can't see them. 
 You don't mention if you are already living together or not (seems like you're not?) but honestly, I would let it go for now. You said you might be moving out of the state in a year or two and there is soooo much that may or may not happen between now and then. I was willing to put my career on hold to move to an entirely new part of our state that I had never even been to before just so I could be with him and I don't even want to think about how much different my life would be had I decided to try to get a job out of state - sure I'd probably have money and I wouldn't be working in food service - but my life is would not be complete without him. Eventually you both may come to this conclusion as well and decide to work together to make a future happen, but it's not going to happen overnight years before the situation even becomes real. Perhaps you both decide the other isn't what you wanted and will end up going your separate ways. You  will  do whatever it takes for both of you to be happy, even if you don't end up together. 
 What matters is the time you have together  now  and you shouldn't be worrying about your future until your future is upon you. If you officially find out you have to move, that's the time to have a real talk about your futures. Just because my BF got a job and  didn't  discuss our future with me right away, he still discussed it with his mom, which is arguably a bigger deal than discussing it with me first. Maybe your BF be willing to move with you because he wants to make it work - but until then, let it be. Stay positive. Stay happy. Don't get your panties in a bunch about a hypothetical future. If you truly love each other, love will find a way :) 
 Good luck OP, I will be looking for an update in the future! 
 TL;DR: I had a similar discussion as OP with my BF. Even though our conversation was abrupt and seemed unsure, it planted the seed of ""What if"" in his head and we are now living together 8 months after the convo took place. Men don't really think that far ahead and OP shouldn't take his lack of response now as not wanting a future together later. Try to live in the moment and only when a life change like moving out of state occurs should the conversation be brought up again. Enjoy the time you have instead of worrying about a future that may or may not happen.";22;F;TRUE;FALSE
"I've always been incredibly wary of my friendships - one foot out of the door, to speak. I have poor boundaries and find it very hard to assert myself. I could give you my life story, but that's not really relevant. My point is, said friend, lets call her Bianca, is someone over the 7 years I've known her I've never been sure to keep a distance from. She's a good friend in many ways, but I've always felt that she had the tendency to be a bit self-centered. 
 The situation 
 Bianca and I were talking about what I wanted for Christmas .From her. She asked me if  I was into candles and stuff like that. I told her that yes I did like candles but would prefer not to get them as a gift as it would be unlikely i'd use them at the moment. I told her that I'd prefer to get a book and proceeded to write down a list (maybe 7 or so) of books I'd like. They were a mix of popular books and slightly obscure ones but not impossible to find nor expensive. 
 So anyway, a week later and she gives me my gift. It's not a book, (she tells me this upon receiving) and it's a... set of candles. the receipt was in there  and it actually cost more to buy the candles than any of the books, so it definitely wasn't a money issue. I also knew where she went shopping as there is only two locations to findthat specific candle set and in both locations there are at least two massive bookstores. Hell, the candle shop nearest to her had a bookstore 25m in front of it. 
 so she wasn't constrained by time, money or struggling for ideas... she just didn't care. 
 On the flipside, I took great care over getting her stuff that was what she wanted or would appreciate -- and she has. She's worn the necklace I got her two days straight. 
 should I tell her how I feel about the gift? Or should I just suck it up? Am I overblowing the significance of her gift? 
 TL;DR: Friend got me a gift I specifically didn't want, I have a poor sense of boundaries/self-respect so have no idea if it was a fuck up or  another confirmation to stay distant from her. 
 Edit: Maybe I wasn't very clear. Clarity seems not to be my greatest strength. I'm fully aware that I can return the gift and get what I want. I'm going to do that. It's not about the actual gift, but her not listening to what I said whatsoever.";25;m;FALSE;FALSE
"Throwaway, since I know other redditors.... 
 Me - 19M
Her - 18F 
 I have a simple question for /r/sex... 
My SO has mentioned that she desires to wait until marriage (NOT for religious purposes, though we are both somewhat religious if it matters) before having full intercourse. We are both virgins. To date, we have done almost everything just short of intercourse, including oral and other fun things. Quite frankly, our physical relationship is incredible, and we really connect emotionally and spiritually whenever we get intimate. My SO and I are very in love, and I fully intend to marry her a few years down the road, but I have been bothered by the fact that we could be goaded into marriage by intercourse... I intend to bring it up with her sometime soon, just letting her know that I may not want to wait until we're married because I don't want sex to be the reason we're getting married. I was just thinking about telling her exactly what I've written here, pretty much, that I love her but sometime in a year or so, I may really want to have intercourse so it doesn't become a carrot baiting us into marriage, so to speak. 
 Let me reiterate, I don't intend to marry her within the next 3 years (and nor does she!! we have to finish school and make it on our own for a little while, first)... But is it so crazy to want to make sure I'm COMPLETELY compatible with her? 
 tl;dr: SO wants to wait until marriage (wouldn't be for another 4 years at least) but I don't want to feel baited into marriage just for sex. 
 EDIT: Shit, I'm a dumbass. I left out some important information.

"Ok I'll try and keep it short. I (31m) have been with my girlfriend (27f) for 5 years now. For most of the relationship I will admit I took advantage of her. I constantly texted my ex wife whom I have a daughter with about meeting up or missing her but never actually followed through with it (still cheating I know). I emotionally neglected her, talked down to her, and all around acted like the biggest piece of shit on the planet. 
 Well she finally left me for another man. I deserve it and I know it should have happened sooner. The thing is when this happened something inside of me sparked. I am head over heels in love with her now. 
 I've gone over it in my head over and over and I honestly know it's not just because I can't have her or she's with someone else, this is honest to god love. We still live together and I see her every day. I've done the usual of begging, buying gifts, and doing anything to make her see I really care but she's still talking to this other guy. 
 They have been talking to each other for about 2 weeks and he is already texting her ""love you"" and other things you shouldn't to someone you've only known for that amount of time. This leads me to believe he is one of those guys I've known all my life that jumps head first into making a girl fall for him all the while saying it to other girls too. I just have a feeling I pushed her into his arms and he's only saying what he thinks she wants to hear or win some competition with me but means none of it. 
 The thing is I feel she is slowly coming around to me. While we're at home I offer to give her massages, which she now let's me do. I've given her hand written letters explaining myself and my feelings which she has kept, and she let's me hug her on the way out for work and when she gets home. When this happened 2 weeks ago she wouldn't even look at me or speak to me. 
 My question is this. How do I push her over the edge of seeing that what I'm saying is true and I am madly in love and would never take her for granted again? How do I get him out of the picture? I know words wont cut it and flowers and cooking dinner aren't enough. Any advice for a downing man?

"Hey all, 
 I [23M] am writing this partially to express myself, because I hold these feelings on the inside for the most part. I also would appreciate some feedback or help. I'm not sure if this belongs in r/breakups or r/ihave issues. This is broad enough that it'll fit here. 
 I was cheated on by my now-ex about a year ago. We tried to sort out the issues in our relationship. However, the trust issues remained. I knew I had to break up with her, and I did, about four months later. The entire relationship lasted a year and a half. Before the incident, I was incredibly in love with her, and I actually pictured myself marrying her at one point. I've never loved anyone as much. I don't think I could love anyone that much for a while. Right now, I'm glad this happened early enough in the relationship. It saved me a lot of trouble in the future. It did fuck me up, though. 
 I'm hurting when I think about it. I saw the signs, and I could have acted on it. I feel like I could have stopped things. I trusted her, so I didn't expect anything. I could feel something was wrong. The worst part was, the guy was extremely friendly to me whenever I was around him. I feel betrayed and hurt by her. I want to hate her. But, I have a lot of sympathy for her and like her. 
 My ex has issues from childhood. So, I don't blame her. She's weak and fragile. I think that's what attracted me to her. I wanted to protect and care for her. But, I also think that it's a crutch for certain bad behaviours. It turned out to sting me. 
 I don't feel like I'm the same person I was before. The break up and being cheated on left me weak and in pieces for numerous months. By the end of December, I finally felt like myself again. Occasionally, I felt badly. My ex came back into my life, crying, about her relationship with another guy that didn't work out. She was threatening to kill herself. Naturally, I wanted to help her out. We chatted, became friends, and that's that. I feel like I'm being used by her for attention occasionally. I decided I didn't want to put up with it anymore, so I started to remain distant. 
 I don't feel like I'm the same person I used to be. I'm still cheerful around people, but I'm less focused on success, and more focused on girls. I desire a really meaningful, passionate, beautiful relationship, but I feel that until I get my life straight again, I won't be able to attain it, or success. 
 anyway, any insight / help / advice is appreciated. 
 tldr: I was cheated on by my ex, and I'm still hurting nearly a year later. I don't feel like myself anymore.";23;M;TRUE;FALSE
"My [ex?]friend [24F] and I [27F] go to a very intensive graduate school, and have been friends for about three years of the five year course. We bonded originally over both being unhappily single, and both recovering from very difficult break ups. 
 Originally she and I would hit the town most weekends to chat up new people, and as I was an active online dater, I made her up a profile and she and I both had multiple dates from them. Soon thereafter she met someone, and they dated for 6 months, until he dumped her. I of course was there for her throughout the end of the relationship, and took her out to help her forget him. She nearly immediately launched into a new relationship (also found online) but ended things with her as he didn't have enough ambition in life. Since then she's been single, saying ""she doesn't want to get in a relationship this close to graduation and moving away"", and she is ""fine being single"". She even ended things with her long term FWB because she didn't want anything serious. 
 
 Throughout all these relationships I've been dating people for no longer than a month, and never anything serious. I truly wanted something more permanent, and thus made efforts to find someone I could see a future with. I freely admit seeing her always having someone when I was only getting a long string of guys saying ""You're awesome, but I just don't want anything serious"", made me rather jealous. I had some difficulties adjusting when she wasn't single, and thus didn't want to go out to bars/clubs, and I was definitely dealing with my own issues of depression and low self worth, which did affect our friendship. But we always recovered and things usually would go back to normal after a month or two of my moodiness. 
 Now I've completely unexpectedly (as I also didn't want to start anything when I'm likely moving away very soon) found a man who I love and can see a future with (We started dating in August), and suddenly her attitude towards me changed completely. 
 It probably started when we went out to a club in early October, but rather than going back to my flat to sleep, I went back to my SO's (which in my mind was no different - it's not like she would be staying with me, I just walked home instead of getting the bus). Since that night she has said I've chosen him over her, and that I've ""changed"". She says I'm always busy, too busy to hang out and ""we never go out like we used to any more"". 
 I've tried inviting her out with my boyfriend, but she doesn't want to be the third wheel (completely valid IMO), and now it has been obvious that she truly hates my boyfriend (obviously because he's taken me away). I've tried inviting her out with just myself, but she seems to always find excuses to not come, or acts really reluctant and seems grumpy to just be around me. Granted, I no longer enjoy going to clubs and dancing with men, but I'm happy to go and watch if that's what she wants! But she never seems to offer to do anything... Its always been me that arranged nights out throughout our whole friendship. 
 
 Three weeks ago, with the latest bout of her saying ""You are always busy, so I'm doing other things"" despite me inviting her out/over to my flat to do things multiple times that week (none of which with my SO), I was very upset and angry, and I mentioned the times I've arranged things, and how she has  never  arranged any outings with me. We haven't talked since. 
 I don't know if I've done something wrong, or if she's jealous (as a mutually friend thinks... but I think it's more! It has to be more than simple jealously!) but more importantly I don't know how to fix this!! I want this to be back to how it was, but I worry this friendship is unfixable. 
 
 tl;dr : Friend of 3 years has been in and out of relationships while I've always been single. The roles have switched, I have a boyfriend, and suddenly she seems to hate me, but claims it's my fault for ""always being busy"". Now we're not even talking. How do I fix this!

"The following is the story of how the Boston Celtics have spent every day since August 22, 1997 over the salary cap. 
 Past is Prologue 
 November 14, 1993:  The NBA Board of Governors, in their infinite wisdom, decide that the Boston Celtics must keep the contract of the recently deceased Reggie Lewis on their salary cap. The late Lewis was owed over $3.3M per season for two more years and, in a league with a $15M salary cap, this left the Celtics trapped in cap hell. 
 June 25, 1997:  The Celtics, decimated by the deaths of Lewis and Len Bias before him, along with the injury-enforced retirements of Larry Bird and Kevin McHale, sit at the draft lottery having recently completed their worst season in league history, a 15-67 catastrophe. A light sits at the end of the tunnel in the form of a 7' center from Wake Forest but the balls bounce towards San Antonio and the Celtics' bad luck seems to be making up for decades of good fortune all in one eleven year span. 
 August 21, 1997:  Having named Eric Williams their SF of the future at the draft a mere two months earlier, Rick Pitino and Chris Wallace send him to Denver for a pair of second round picks in a move immediately admitted to be about the salary cap. 
 August 22, 1997:  Pitino, in reaction to missing out on Tim Duncan and in the interest of running a more up-tempo offense built around Antoine Walker and three point bombers, signs Chris Mills to a six year deal worth a total of $26.1M. He will never play for the Celtics and is traded exactly two months later. They also sign backup PG Tyus Edney and reach that season's salary cap of $26.9M. 
 I believe that this is the last time the Boston Celtics were officially below the salary cap. 
 February 18, 1998:  Having drafted Chauncey Billups, Pitino decides it would be better to have Kenny Anderson making $5M/year and Popeye Jones because, well, Rick Pitino was not a good GM. 
 Strike, Strike, Strike! (I mean lockout) 
 For the first 14 years of the NBA's salary cap it was a relatively straightforward enterprise. A team could spend up to the cap and the go over it to re-sign their own free agents using the apocryphally named ""Bird Rights."" Once a team was over the cap they could only use minimum contracts to sign players which kept most teams right around the cap unless they had transcendent star players (or deceased all stars stuck on their books). 
 Leading into the 1998-99 season the owners decided to pick a fight with the players leading to a lockout and a shortened season. As part of the new collective bargaining agreement the league introduces the concept of the mid-level and bi-annual cap exceptions. For the next 17 years the Celtics will rely on Bird Right, trades, the draft, minimum contracts and these new cap exceptions to make 280 player acquisitions without ever dropping below the salary cap. 
 There's no salary cap in the NCAA 
 Armed with the new tools of the CBA, Pitino and Wallace set to work in epically screwing up the Celtics' cap situation. In the years before capologists, analytics nerds, and the Internet this wasn't a unique story but few front offices could imagine signing more middling players in more creatively destructive ways than Pitino. Chris Mills was a fitting start to GM Pitino's reign. 
 The first move that locked the Celtics above the cap was a reasonable one. On the day that teams could start signing new contracts post-lockout, the Celtics gave a six year contract extension to their 22 year old all star Antoine Walker. The deal kicked in for the 1999-2000 season. 
 The rest of that season's signings were... less than ideal. On the same day that Antoine was extended Pitino gave a new three year deal to Popeye Jones. The negative feedback loop of a team over the cap overpaying its own average players for fear of not being able to replace them had begun. Walter ""I love Waltah"" McCarty followed with a three year deal of his own. In March the Celtics traded multiple future first round picks (including one that became Andre Miller) For Vitaly Potapenko and two days later he was given a new six year $33M deal. In terms of the modern cap that would be like paying Ian Mahinmi $10M/year to be your starter for the next half decade. 
 The next season would see Tony Battie re-up for six seasons and the following year it was Danny Fortson's turn to be handed a seven year pact. That feedback loop of relying on Bird Rights to re-sign mediocre players, along with annual use of the MLE, left the Celtics a cool 40% over the cap with a pile of long-term contracts for a 36 win team. Imagine the current Celtics but with everyone older and signed to rich long-term contracts and without all their future picks. Screw you Rick Pitino and thank God for Paul Pierce. 
 February 8, 2001:  Rick Pitino exits and Jim O'Brien walks through that door. Chris Wallace somehow stays on as GM, in large part because the Celtics' ownership was absent. 
 It's About Process, Not Results 
 July 7, 2001:  The Celtics have three first round picks and select Joe Johnson, Kedrick Brown and Joe Forte. The final selection comes down to a choice between Tony Parker and Joe Forte. The Celtics forget that 85 year old Red Auerbach's position with the team is largely ceremonial and go with his favorite, Forte. 
 February 20, 2002:  The Celtics trade Joe Johnson and a future 1st for Tony Delk and Rodney Rogers but manage to hold onto Kedrick Brown and Joe Forte. Oh, ffs. 
 In between these moves the Celtics take the step that, combined with all their prior missteps, will lock them in above the cap for the next couple of years. The team re-signs Paul Pierce to a six year $85M extension that he will most definitely earn, despite a few early bumps in the road. 
 The team also starts to learn it's lesson about feeling the need to re-sign everyone because they're above the cap and start making moves to clear some dead weight. Anderson, Potapenko, and Forte head to Seattle for Vin Baker and Shammond Williams. No one wins a trade like this but it's what ends up happening when one team gives giant contracts to bad players (because how else could we replace them!) and the other sees a former all star get fat and become an alcoholic. 
 The real lesson is in letting their former ghosts of Christmas past in Mark Blount, Rodney Rogers and Erick Strickland simply leave via free agency. These are not irreplaceable parts. 
 December 31, 2002:  The Boston Celtics are sold for $360M to Boston Basketball Partners 
 February 20, 2002:  The Celtics trade to reacquire Mark Blount. Why you gotta do this to me? 
 The Tables Begin to Turn 
 May 9, 2003:  The Celtics hire Danny Ainge and in the course of six months go from having below average ownership and management to one of the best pairings in the league. 
 We now enter a period of average, rather innocuous moves for a team stranded above the cap starting a prolonged breakdown of a flawed roster. Antoine Walker becomes Raef LaFrentz and (eventually) Delonte West. That trade brings back the dead contract of the now retired salary cap progenitor Chris Mills in a bit of contract matching chicanery. 
 The player-for-player moves are rarely brilliant. Eric Williams, back in the fold years later, is moved with Tony Battie for massive headache Ricky Davis in what becomes a lesson in the difficult to understand world of personalities and culture. The one major mistake is a repeat of past screw-ups: re-signing Mark Blount for six years, because how else can a team above the cap replace someone as import as Mark Blount?! 
 The real work begins to take shape in the draft and on the sidelines. Good soldier Jim O'Brien has left and Doc Rivers arrives from Orlando. The Celtics select Kendrick Perkins and Al Jefferson in consecutive drafts. They trade for the picks that become Tony Allen and West. These young players on rookie deals will eventually give the Celtics the kind of flexibility they've so sorely lacked since the death of Reggie Lewis. 
 In Danny Ainge's biggest non-move he tries but fails to trade Paul Pierce for the 3rd overall pick where he would have taken Chris Paul. 
 However, the Celtics are still perpetually above the cap and decline from an outer-fringe contender making the Leastern Conference Finals to a young squad outside the playoffs. Even now in the mid 00's the mistakes of 5-8 years past clutter the C's cap sheet. Players flipped in desperate attempts to stay relevant, or re-signed for fear of losing anyone with a name, strand the team $20M over the cap but out of the playoffs. As late as 2006 the Celtics have $25-30M tied up in the likes of LaFrentz, Davis, Blount, and the long since released Baker. Now they also have Jefferson, Perkins, West, Allen, and Ryan Gomes for ~$5M in total, though. 
 The Plan Comes Together 
 January 26, 2006:  The Celtics trade Ricky Davis and Mark Blount (bye again) for Wally Szczerbiak 
 June 28, 2006:  The Celtics trade Raef LaFrentz and Randy Foye for Theo Ratliff and Sebastian Telfair 
 These things will be important. Trader Danny is kicking into high gear. 
 Danny Ainge's years long project to clean up the Celtics' house finally seemed to be drawing to a close in 2006-07. They kick off the season by drafting a young alien out of Kentucky, Rajon Rondo. It would be a long year on the court, in part due to an injury to Paul Pierce, but the team was down to less than $10M over the cap with more dollars than that set to expire at the end of the season. For the first time in a decade the Celtics looked to be a year away from having no cap troubles at all. The ""flexibility"" that Ainge now values so much made it's first appearance in this season as the Celtics were looking at simultaneous options in the trade, free agent, and draft markets. 
 Not a whole lot else happens during this playing season. Pierce and Perkins re-up while Pierce agitates for more veteran help. Greg Oden and Kevin Durant own college ball and leave Celtics fans salivating. 
 May 22, 2007:  For the second time in our tale the Celtics taste lottery heartbreak. They enter with the second worst record and leave with the fifth best pick. 
 This is really the last turning point in the story. Had the Celtics won the first or second pick they would have selected Kevin Durant and more than likely traded Paul Pierce within a year. The team would have gone below the salary cap after a decade above it and this story wouldn't be all that special. However, that's not how things played out... 
 Who Cares About the Luxury Tax? 
 June 28, 2007:  The Celtics trade Szczerbiak, West and Jeff Green for Ray Allen 
 July 31, 2007:  The Celtics trade Jefferson, Ratliff and lots of parts for Kevin Garnett and his ginormous (and completely worth it) salary 
 In the alternate Kevin Durant reality the Celtics would have watched the contracts of Szczerbiak and Ratliff wind down before going under the cap in 2008. Instead: flexibility pays off. With the moves for Garnett and Allen the question is no longer ""how do we get under the cap"" but ""how far can we push over the luxury tax."" For our story this is less interesting. Great teams should do everything they can to add talent at the expense of salary. Brining in James Posey, Eddie House, PJ Brown, Sam Cassell, Brandon Bass, Courtney Lee, and re-signing all your good free agents makes perfect sense when you're trying to win titles. The Celtics went on a five year run as contenders and hung Banner 17. All was good in the world and the Celtics wonderful new ownership made $45M in luxury tax payments to support it. For once, the Celtics are above the cap for the right reasons, but they're still above it. 
 Denoument 
 The rest, you probably already know. The Celtics's title window closed a few seasons ago as age took it's inevitable toll. Ainge moved back into ""break it down"" mode and has been brilliant at [making trades]( and leveraging every asset. 
 July 12, 2013:  The Celtics trade Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, and Jason Terry for Gerald Wallace, Kris Humphries, Keith Bogans, and the Nets future 
 The last two seasons have seen the Celtics stay above the cap in large part because of extensions given to Pierce and Garnett that led to this mega-trade. Wallace still clogs the Celtics cap sheet while Humphires and Bogans were moved as parts in the long chain of trades that lead to the current Celtics. These last two seasons have been like the first few of Danny's GM career as moves have been towards asset collecting and flexibility under the constraints of a team above the cap. 
 July 10, 2015:  ? 
 All of this will now likely lead to the Celtics going below the salary cap on or around July 10th of this year. There are still some low probability paths to keep them above it but it seems almost certain that the franchise's 18 consecutive years above the salary cap are coming to a close this offseason. 
 It's been a long, strange journey for the Celtics these past few decades. One thing I would take from this is that the popular narrative that the Celtics ""have never signed a big-time free agent"" is more than a little misleading. The free agent landscape that we know today has only been in existence since the 1980's, and really the 90's. In all that time the Celtics have NEVER had the ability to pay someone else's free agent more than the MLE, and for some of those years they couldn't even offer that. We don't know if strong ownership, a great GM, and a bright young coach will be enough to lure players to Boston. Maybe taxes and 40"" of snow are too much to overcome but Kevin Garnett did agree to come by trade and no one we've ever wanted to keep has forced their way out. This July will more than likely ring in a new era in Celtics' history. The 6,500+ days they'll have spent over the cap have been interesting, sometimes thrilling, mostly infuriating, and now almost over.
