"Little background info i am 25 and shes 29 (30 in a couple weeks) we met each other two years ago and have been living together for the past year and we are using the pill as a form of contraceptive, she has been on the pill since 15 because of really bad cramps and migraine during her periods which she says the pill takes away mostly. 
 The thing is when i met her i knew she was not interested in sex and had a low sex drive. I didn't come to be with her because of sex, but i am a guy and i do enjoy sex and it we got to a point where it was just once a week and to be honest i could live with that because there is a lot more to relationships than just sex, but the once a week thing only happens when we have discussion after discussion on why i want to have sex again. 
 It got to a point where i really felt detached because i feel like i had to beg for sex and so i set out looking for a solution, after reading reddit and a few websites i saw that the PILL could cause negative libido and a few woman had described that sex felt like a job they only did because their SO asked them to. 
 Well now we get to the problem, my gf is a stubborn little girl and its really hard to change her mind once shes set on something and in my haste i didn't think the problem through and i made a deal with the devil, i ran to her saying that i would give up sex for two months if she gave up the pill for two months, to be honest i figured she would say no and we would negotiate and then figure something out.. but alas she said yes and thus today she skipped her pill and begins my two months of non sexual adventures. 
 Anything i can do to salvage this deal and put me back in the sexual spotlight ? or do i have to just suck it up and deal with the next two months.","i asked her to stop taking the pill for 2 months and i would stop having sex with her for 2 months she agreed, i wanna renegotiate xD",25,M,relationship_advice

 >Dad expects me to take over the family business but I just want the ability to make my own decisions in life without making my parents profoundly sad or depressed. How do I handle this? 
 I have been dealing with this situation/decision for over a year now.  I am currently working for my dad but he knows I had hinted at moving on.  Shit's gotten serious the past couple of months though as I have applied to grad school on the other side of the country.  While this is visibly hurting him, (he started the business in 1980 and its been his life's work) the economy is hurting the outlook of the company in the upcoming years.  I need to look out for my own interest.  I need to find a  much  more reliable job that I know will be around in ten, twenty, thirty years rather than taking on a struggling company.  Those were  his  aspirations, not yours, and as long as you succeed in doing whatever  you  want to do, it would be selfish of him as a parent to not be happy for you.","It will hurt him in the short-term if you leave, that's for sure, but he'll get over it and will be happy if you're happy.",27,M,relationships

"I started dying my hair when I was 14, my mom darkened my hair and was very picky as to what I could do with it and when. She was liberal to an extent. She let me do platinum blonde in the front and black in the back, let me do pink, etc... She'd never let me do blue or green or anything she considered too ""boy-ish"". So when I moved out I pretty much had the money to do whatever I wanted and nobody to say otherwise. That was my downfall. 
 I did a pixie not too long ago to lop off a lot of the fried hair, and a lot of people say it looks cute, I'm assuming those who think otherwise have just kept their mouth shut, but honestly I don't really like it. I want to just shave off as much as I need to and start over. I bought a wig yesterday. It was $40, so it's not like it's anything fancy, but come tax season I was thinking about getting a human hair wig to get myself by until my hair like really grew out. 
 I wore the wig to work and of course got a bunch of questions, but if I just keep wearing it I think everyone will get used to it. The only reason I'm hesitant is because of my boyfriend. He likes long hair, and as long as we've been dating the longest my hair has been was to my shoulders. He grew to like the pixie, but he said he'll really find a shaved head unattractive. He later said that he's fine with whatever I want to do to my hair, but I know he's gonna hate it. 
 I found  this  said she wants to practice a fade on me too before she cuts it off. All I told her was that I want to shave it though, so she might be thinking I really want to just buzz the damn thing. Is it possible for her to practice a fade and still maintain the length in the picture? If not I'll just have to tell her she's beat ;p lol 
 Wow I ramble.","Want to shave my head and wear wigs until it's at a decent length again, has anyone done this? What are your thoughts if you have? What's an average hair growth time for a white/hispanic 20 y/o female?",20,F,FancyFollicles
"Okay, so my SO (21 f CAN) and I (20 m US) met online about a year and a half ago. We knew there was something between us, so we decided to go for the LDR last October. I immediately told my parents about the situation and how I was going to meet her over my winter break, since I still live with them while I finish school. They are (for the most part) completely supportive of our relationship. However, she has still not told her parents. She lives on her own for school about two hours away, and she doesn't drive, so it would be difficult for her to get to them. Obviously this is something she'd want to tell them in person. 
 At first, she thought about telling them before our first visit, but that would be during Christmas and she didn't want to cause that big of a commotion during the holidays - and that is completely understandable. 
 So our first visit came and went (amazingly, by the way), and she planned on telling them the next time she went home, which would be her spring break. I was getting excited for her to finally tell them, but then all of a sudden she decided she'd rather stay home for the break. I was a little disappointed, but that was okay. When she is with her family, it's almost as if I don't exist because she is still trying to hide our relationship until she finds a good time to tell them - meaning I get one or two messages a day opposed to our constant all day normal talking. So being able to talk to her for the whole week was a good enough reason to not care at the time. 
 Fast forward until the day before her spring break. She decides she wants to go home now. I was fine with that, thinking she'd tell them finally. Wrong. After the whole week of barely talking she gets home, and I asked if she told them. She said she wanted to wait until after her exams to tell them now. Again, I'm disappointed, but I can understand the reasoning. 
 So last night I brought it up (I never do because I don't want to seem like I'm pushing her to do anything. I know she wants to tell them, but I just get curious). Her exams are next week, so I asked when the next time she'd be going to her parents'. She told me it would be for her mother's birthday, and she really wasn't sure she'd want to tell them on her birthday. Which is understandable. 
 But I'm just getting tired of all these things coming up that are pushing it off. I hate having to not exist every time she's with her family. I don't like being hung up on while on Skype mid-sentence once every few hours when her parents call to talk. I get annoyed with all of the privacy settings I have to go through on Facebook so her family doesn't see me. All the little things like that, which add up... as you can see. 
 I know this is not her fault, but am I wrong for feeling this way? I just feel like it's bothering me more than it should.","My girlfriend hasn't told her family about me after 6 months because of poor situations, and I'm just getting a little antsy about it.

"Let me begin by saying that I work retail, and that I really like my job. This morning, one of my coworkers approached me and asked if I wanted to try a ghost chili pepper. Having heard of these notoriously spicy peppers from challenge videos on youtube, and being a lover of spicy foods, I decided to give it a try. My coworker produces a suspicious looking bag from his back pocket and removes one of the many dried peppers, encouraging me to ""just shove the whole thing in my mouth."" 
 Reddit, I would ordinarily be cautious with such a thing, but given that I was recently transferred to another store, my male alpha complex kicked in and told me that I needed to prove my manliness to aforementioned coworker. I pop the pepper into my mouth and was immediately disgusted at the tasted of burnt, bacon-grease-soaked leather that fills my mouth. I chewed quickly, hoping to swallow the foul thing before it continued to offend me further. 
 It was a matter of seconds before I ran to the back room, overtaken by what I can adequately say is the most spicy thing I have ever put into any part of my body, fighting back the tears that were forcing themselves into my eyes. I rushed to the drinking fountain, but it was no help. I grabbed a nearby roll of toiled paper and scrubbed at my tongue, hoping to remove any residue that could potentially cause me more pain. Still no luck. I spent the next 10 minutes crouched over the water spout as I let water rush across my tongue, hoping and praying that the pain would cease. 
 Finally, the burning sensation began to fade, reasserting its presence as my tongues' arch-enemy every time I swallowed the spit gathering at the back of my mouth. My eyes were bloodshot as I walked back to the floor, not wanting my extended absence from my department to draw any notice. Almost immediately, I was approached by a customer who went on for some time asking me questions about various items, studying me carefully the entire time. As he awaited my answers I watched his eyes dart from the product, to my eyes, to my nametag, and back to my eyes again. Eventually I sent him on his way, and my day continued as normal. 
 Cut to an hour later, I receive a call from my out-of-store district manager. ""Macasaurus, do you have any reason to believe that any of your customers may have thought you were using drugs?"" What? No. I'm not the type of person to come into work under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Then I remember. The chili pepper. My bloodshot eyes. ""I hate to do this,"" he continued, ""but it's policy that I get you scheduled for a drug screening this week, I'll email you the details."" 
 Well, shit. It just so happens that recently I had a friend who got off parole, and we were celebrating as I imagine many recently-off-parole people would do. I'm not going to pass this test Reddit, and I really loved this job.","Ate a ghost chili pepper at work, got scheduled for a career-ending drug test.",20,M,tifu
"We've been together for over a year now, but we've been friends for five years. At the very beginning of our relationship, he cheated on me with his ex. It was the tamest kind of cheating, I guess you could say, they just made out in his car after he went to return some stuff to her. I had a hard time figuring out if I should stay with him or not. But obviously I did. I definitely had trust issues to start, but I got over them. I do trust him, almost 100%. Some days I feel it is 100%, but others I just don't know. I think I've become insanely jealous and it's not healthy for either of us. We set boundaries after all this went down, he told me he wouldn't be alone with a girl except me, and if he was going to hang out with a girl it would be in public. 
 Fast forward to now, my boyfriend just turned 21. He wants to go out for a drink, and since he doesn't have many friends, the one he happens to chat about this with is a girl I've never met before. Side note, this all started when he asked if it was okay to get a drink with her, so he's not completely inconsiderate, I just got super defensive that he would even want to go with her. 
 We live an hour away from each other, and the only time I've seen him since his birthday was a visit to his work for dinner. We haven't really gotten to celebrate since he actually turned 21. I really do get that he wants to go out for his birthday, and I hate myself for being so jealous. I want him to have a good time because he's been working a lot lately, and well, it's his 21st birthday. I'd be completely okay if it was a guy, but idk. Him being friends with girls just gets to me, and I keep my mouth shut about it 99% of the time, but this time just sent me over the edge. 
 There's one more factor that makes me feel even worse about it, and it's that a few months ago, I went to a movie with a guy friend of mine. We tried to find other people to go, but no one was available. I was having a crappy week, and I just wanted to hang out with a friend, so we went to see The Avengers. During the movie, my boyfriend gets super pissed at me, accusing the guy I was with of taking me on a date. I let him know that it's completely platonic (we met at the theater, bought our own tickets). He's not having any of it.  He's also upset that I told him I didn't want to see the movie and then went with someone else to see it. But I told him it wasn't my choice, and I just needed some friend time. He doesn't get it. Eventually, after hours of fighting, he gives in with a kind of ""fine whatever, you're right"" attitude. I don't think we've even officially resolved it, but I don't go to movies alone with guys anymore because I know it makes him uncomfortable and I respect that. 
 I just feel like him going out for a drink with her goes against everything we've worked for. Sure, it technically doesn't violate the boundaries we set up, but I'm starting to feel like just being in public isn't enough. I feel like there should be people there that know him and know he has a girlfriend to keep him in check... But I don't know why I'm saying this. I do trust him. I'm just so insecure and I really do love him and I know he loves me but I don't want him to mess us up. We've worked so hard. 
 I don't want to be this controlling girlfriend who doesn't let her boyfriend do things. But I feel like that's who I've become. Is it weird that I blame myself for it? Maybe it is my fault. Maybe it's not anyone's fault. Maybe it's his fault for cheating on me in the first place. Just so you know, he's perfectly okay with not going out for a drink with her. I just hate asking him not to. Maybe I'm being stupid, but he should have known... but he's not a mind reader. AHHHH. I am so conflicted.","My boyfriend wants to go out for a ""birthday drink"" with one of his female friends. I'm insanely uncomfortable and probably jealous, for a few reasons.

"A couple years ago a good friend of mine and my (now ex) girlfriend went to my cousins house to watch some playoff hockey. It was a Saturday and I was already late getting to his house for the start of the game so I decided to skip eating in order to get there for the start of the game. His drink of choice is Captain Morgan, so as a friendly gesture I brought a bottle as a thanks for having me and my two friends he'd never met before then. 
 As it turned out, he already had his own bottle he was drinking, so I figured I'd crack the bottle I brought and proceeded to make myself a captain and coke. By the end of the 2nd period I had finished the bottle by myself and the last thing I remember is seeing some of that intermission recap before waking up naked 8 hours later on the bathroom floor of my friends apartment being stared at by 2 or 3 17 year old girls. 
 Apparently after passing out, my cousin called my brother to come pick me and my friends up. They decided it was best to take me back to my friends apartment since he lives by himself, I still live at home, and my mom is very anti-drinking, so in order to save 22 year old me an ear beating, that's where they took me. 
 Some highlights of that trip that i was later informed of include: me puking all over myself in the back of my brothers car. as my brother and my friend were carrying me into his apartment I apparently puked on my brothers face, he freaked out and dropped me and I smacked my head off the asphalt. Again carrying me into the apartment they dropped me and I rolled down the stairs. Since I was covered in puke my (ex) girlfriend decided to undress me and wash my clothes while my brother and her watched me in shifts to make sure I stayed on my side and didn't choke on my own vomit. What was my friend doing this whole time? Hitting on a couple 17 year old girls and taking pictures of me in my naked passed out state.

"I'll begin with some back story because without any context, this would made no sense. 
 When I was 14 I ran into some troubles during my Freshman year of high school. I became severely depressed and acquired social anxiety along side of that. Since then, nothing has really been the same for me. I've always had a strong resentment towards those that have wronged me, and I have a lot of trouble with new people. During my time in a depressive state (I am better now), my father would always be there for me. Not only was he there for me, he filled the role of a best friend for me. He was aware of this, and he did a pretty damn good job of filling that role. While words cannot describe how thankful I am for what he did, that is not the beginning of the problem that is now at hand. 
 As previously stated, my father was irreplaceable during my healing process. He provided me with the tools and essentials required to beat depression. While he provided me with the tools to heal, those tools also provided me with a bright future, so much that shines like the brightest fucking star in the world. The way I beat depression was by focusing on school, playing games and occupying myself. Little did I know at the time, this is what I wanted to pursue in college, and it would also be my future(hopefully!). 
 Right now, I'm a Junior in high school, and I'm set on graduating early. But I'm not graduating early because I hate high school... I'm doing it because I hate my home life and would like to pursue my dreams elsewhere. Sure, hate is a strong word. I come home every day to a mother that is putting herself under a stupid and illogical amount of stress that eventually makes its way to my shoulders. My father(prior to getting a dog recently) has spent many hours outside of the home, presumably because he isn't happy either. My brother recently moved back home and he's not the same guy he used to be, I don't connect with him on the same level I did when we were kids and young teenagers. And finally, my sister is severely depressed right now and uses it as an excuse to openly be an asshole to the rest of the family. Granted, depression is nothing the mess with. I understand the effects of it, I was there. However, it is not an excuse to outwardly disrespect those that love and care about you, not to mention distract them and guilt them into doing things for you when you previously were incapable of giving them the time of day. 
 Now that the family has been introduced, lets throw in a few more issues. I believe the same opportunities that are available to me this year, will no longer be available to me next year. I currently am very happy and extremely motivated in school. I have found ways to distract myself from my surroundings. Despite this, I cannot do it for another year and a half. Playing Hearthstone and League of Legends for 6 hours a day and doing school work after everybody goes to sleep only works for so long. Recently I've been becoming sleep deprived and excessively tired during the day because I am incapable of getting work done while people are around during the day. While this sounds crazy, listening to my mother and sister fight, hearing my brothers distractions(list too long to put here), or hearing my father wont be back until 10pm tonight(the thought of infidelity has come to mind, but he doesn't seem like that type of person) puts an unbearable amount of stress on me. 
 I'm sure there are quite a few people here that could tell me what real problems are, but honestly, I'm not sure how to explain why this situation is so stressful for me. Typically I deal with stress relatively well and can solve my problems pretty easily. Maybe my ties to home, what I know and what has made me who I am isn't ready to be severed yet? Who knows. 
 All history and problems aside, I know have another question. Early graduation is still very much a possibility. I am set to take my SATs on December 4th and it will be the first time I am seeing the test. I have never taken a test longer than two hours and am incredibly bad at taking lengthy tests. My grades, activities, and interviews with all of my colleges of interest(I will be applying to top colleges in the nation for my program) have all gone exceptionally well. But, this one thought is just lingering... What if I do terrible on my SATs? If I score any lower than 18 or 1900, there is a good chance I can kiss my dreams goodbye for another year. 
 To my understanding, the SATs are a critical thinking and general knowledge test. For somebody like myself, that doesn't seem like a big challenge. I'm a logical thinker and have never had a problem taking tests that I don't know the subject matter. Because of this, I got through my Freshman and Sophomore year of high school while being depressed(I never studied for anything). I do not expect to know everything on the SATs, I do however expect to score in the 2000s knowing what I know about myself. But I can't, and I mean can NOT sit in a chair for 6+ hours and take this test. It's going to do the education systems equivalent of rape me. All I do now to prepare is take the exams that College Board provides me with, I score extremely well on them, thus I am confident when it comes to actually being tested. But in this manor, I'm concerned with my inability to take long tests. 
 So, now that we're arriving at our final destination... I'm looking for primarily general advice on the problems at hand. I don't really need a direct answer to anything, I would really just like some outside opinions. People to tell me what I could do to better my standings in any of the given scenarios, or for people to just talk about their stories on the topic and maybe lead me in a better direction? 
 Thanks for any advice, help or responses in advance!","Family problems, would like to pursue my dreams in college a year early, not sure where to go. Seeking general advice/help from people who have experienced similar or have been in situations or scenarios relating to mine.",14,M,relationships
"A bit about myself: I'm in my middle-twenties, I make a respectable amount in my profession (med. device R&D), and I have also been managing a 23-unit apartment building (1920s brownstone) with my long term girlfriend during the course of the last two years. 
 We're familiar with the day-to-day issues with managing an older property, such as tenant issues (noise-complaints, late rents, etc.), maintenance issues (largely plumbing issues in this building), and we handle almost all of the administrative tasks for the building (maintenace, coordinating with contractors, dealing with utilities, rent collection, etc.). 
 We don't, however, know much about the financial aspects of multi-family properties. The building owner handles the property taxes, insurance (both building and boiler policies), etc., so we are not very familiar that portion of the business. 
 We have, mostly, been enjoying the experience, and think there is great wealth potential in this business. We've been doing the ""grunt"" work at our current building for two years now, and we are ready to start seeing the finanical benefits of multi-family housing.

 I'm a 30 something single dad , so just up and moving to a new state, & city would provide several additional challenges given my circumstances. Although that is the most appealing thought to me, I cant logistically pull it off at this time. I can admit that I am heavily invested both personally, & in a business sense into my network of ""friends"" they tie into work, & play but the return vs. investments aren't panning out evenly, & haven't been for some time. I feel like I support them, emotionally they dump things on me. Keeping the fake smile to maintaine appearences is hard all the time, & every now n then ""friendship"" slips in but any time I have shared anything personal, I find it's suddenly gossip. They are always asking for ""favors"" I Feel resentful. I didnt used to be a ""nice guy"" like this. It just happened over the last few years, & now I am waking up. Cutting people out, real angry with everyone, & myself. 
 Recently a event has shaken me to the point where I felt a need to re-evaluate my position. I can say without a doubt I have withdrawn. Blocked #'s, shrank my social media down exponentially. I have kept my immediate business contacts, family. The various other friendships I have made, & maintained through my work over the years are still around, but they are for the most part not real relationships more so they are ""networking"" So i have a lot of pseudo friendships some try to take it to that ""real"" level, & have succeeded on breaking through, only to let me down in one way or another normally its a trust factor that was broken somewhere. 
 They say hang out with those you can build with. Don't get stagnant. I look around, & think to myself I don't want to be here. People are doing the same things. I need a new lifestyle. No more Complacency. I need a radical change from within. Completely get me out of my comfort zone. Drastic change needed. I tried talking to some people about this, they dont get it, they tell me no dont do it it will pass etc. feel like they are holding me down. .. So my conclusion given my options... 
 Drop the Axe on social media, & all current realtionships associated. Go into some serious self improvement, hopefuly find new circles to travel in, hopefuly meet some people I can relate with a bit more, people doing fruitful things with their time, & have meaningful open friendships with. I need more real guy friends thats for sure female friendships are no good for me.

"Hello Reddit, today i fucked up.
Im Portuguese, so bear with my English. 
 Backstory : It all started when I moved to an apartment w/ my mom in a different city from which I lived in once. So, during the week im usually with my mom but at the weekends she goes back home and I stay home alone. 
 Actual Story: Coming back from comic con (07.12) I sleep really well after having so much fun. The next day, at about 20:00 I decide I should play some Starcraft II with my cousin and a friend. Okay, we play 2 rounds. Being the 17 year old that I am I decide I eat whenever I want and I inform my friends that I am indeed going to cook dinner. So, I get up, and choose to fry some potatoes. I remember my mom always telling me: -“Let the oil heat before putting anything in, or it’ll get soaked”. But there’s a difference this time. There’s about 20% of the amount of oil I usually use. Okay, it should take a while heating. 
 I set it up, and come back to the computer which is right next to the kitchen door. 30 seconds later I see an orange light coming from the kitchen, and I tell my cousin: -“Uhhh I think something  is wrong over there, brb”. 
 I go in. The oil pan was burning with meter high flames. HOLY SHIT THE CLOSET WAS ON FIRE OH FUCK OH FUCK WHAT SHOULD I DO.
So, I started by instantly turning off the heat of the oil and turning off the oven in which the cordon bleu was cooking. I pick up a container, fill it with water and prepare myself to throw it. 
 (Disclaimer: I know that water is a dumb idea against oil fires, but everything was starting to get on fire, I had no other chance and I live in an apartment. So I decided I should throw and jump away).
I go to the door, throw the container and jump to the side, hearing a loud “BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM” followed by a noise similar to what you would hear in a Counter Strike flashlight direct hit. This happened as I jumped off my kitchen which might have saved my life. So, did you guys know that for each milliliter of water in an oil fire 2 liters of dark smoke will appear? Well, that shit kills. I turn back, see some stuff burning (papers, washing machine had oil and got a bit burned by the over 200cº oil. BUT THE DARK SMOKE HOLY SHIT I THOUGHT I’D DIE. I run in, try to open the window but its broken and it doesn’t open. I can’t see anything in the deep smoke, so I run outside while the papers burn and there’s burning oil everywhere and I lean into a window, trying to get some air. Meanwhile I open every window, and it wrapped some bandages around my face so I could filter it. My hair was gray, my boogers were gray, even my saliva! 
 As a conclusion, burned the exhaust for the stove and burned the closets. Glad I didn’t die or burn myself. A simple teaspoon of water creates an enormous fireball, and I threw at least a liter or so. 
 SO REDDIT, I FUCKED UP PRETTY BADLY.","Burned my kitchen down cuz apparently im bad at cooking. Wanted to make cordon bleu, instead made my “fogon blew” (fogão --- stove in Portuguese).

"I am a 22 (M) she is a 21(F). we have been dating for 4 years last week and the relationship is almost perfect. In fact most of the time I would call it perfect. 
 Over the last 2 years I have noticed she almost never initiates and intimacy of any kind. When we are sitting next to each other she doesn't try to hold my hand or make any kind of physical contact and she has only ever told me she loves me a few times without me saying it first. She will only maybe once a month try to put her arms around me to give me a hug. I can only recall her making a move on me 3 times in the last 2 years. Along the lines of surprising me when she comes out of the shower. Those moments are great obviously but even on the rare occasion when she grabs my hand or reaches up to give me a hug I feel so alive. 
 We have a good sex life but after thinking about it I realized I always am starting things off. Many times things will get hot and heavy and I will perform oral on her for as long an an hour and afterwards she wont even so much as try to touch me at all. After the first few times I figured she was just tired or something but after the tenth or so time I don't know what to think. When she is really into it its great any everything I want but more than not it ends with her having an orgasm and me leaving back to my house. Also I am beginning to think she doesn't like kissing either. When we are having sex she will kiss me for a second the stop and just kind of look past me. This is heart breaking because kissing turns me on more than about anything else and makes me feel closer than anything.. 
 So tonight I finally couldn't take it anymore and just asked her why she is not making any physical contact with me or anything. She said she doesn't know to do those things like hold my hand, hug me, or playful flirting. I asked her to elaborate and she said she has no instinct to do those things. Like if she really happy with me or something she doesn't know to reach out and touch me or something similar. It reminded me of the way autistic people have a hard time relating to relationships. 
 At this point I feel terrible and give her a big hug and just hold her for a while as she sobs. I feel like a world class dick after confronting her. I know she loves me and I don't think she is cheating on me or anything like that. It really seems like she cannot reciprocate affection or something like that. So as I tried to talk to her about this she kind of shutdown and just wouldn't respond. I would have to ask a question a few times before she would answer.  She tells me she wants to spend the rest of our lives together and that makes me very happy but I need her to make me feel loved. I am at a complete loss. I have no idea what to do. Anything would help.",My girlfriend never makes the first move of any kind. Tonight she told me she doesn't understand how to handle emotions and intimate feelings.,22,M,relationships
"My family emigrated to New Zealand when I was 19. I fly out to visit them from the UK when I can afford to. This is the longest journey I could possibly take on planet earth, as you can imagine sitting around in airports for hours waiting for your connection get's boring, especially when you're sweating in between two overweight strangers for 12 hours before and after. Anyway, I was at the check in desk at Auckland airport about to fly to China for my connecting flight home, I approached the desk and checked in. The lady behind the desk must have felt sorry for me flying so far and alone, she said she'd ""Seat me upstairs and keep me company."" I didn't really catch on to what she meant until I was handed a 1st class ticket.

 I'm 30 years old and I've been out of work for about 2 years now with depression and anxiety. I've been trying to sort myself out and I've had a bit of counselling and made attempts to try and get better. 
 I'm kind of panicking as my life is passing me by and I've missed out on a lot of experience I could have had during this time. I just really need some good advice on what I should do and what route I should go down. 
 I walked out of my last job as an SEO/PPC Trainee because I felt I couldn't handle it. The open office environment; a few of the people I were working with on a daily basis were really horrible people in general; the long time out of work during/after Uni; the long hours; it was very hard for me to adjust going back to this routine. Long story short, it's really knocked my confidence within IT as I feel I gave up and failed. 
 I want to work in IT as that's all I have done and I feel like I have some skills and knowledge that a lot of people don't have that I might be able to use but it's been a long time since I've used them. The Operating Systems have changed and evolved since I used them in a workplace. (I only work with Windows systems). 
 I want some possible entry level IT options that I can consider that is a relatively ""stress free"" role to get myself back into the swing of things. Ideally it'd be part time and I'm considering volunteer work to help me get my CV filled up with some recent experience. I feel like I have good troubleshooting skills, and logical approach to solving problems. People in my family and friends always come to me for help with computer/phone/technology issues.

"So I'm not sure where OP is from, so just in case OP is from Canada, I'm gonna give you all here a Canadian perspective (seeing as all the comments seem to be US-based) - upvote so OP sees it! 
 I'm a 3rd year pharmacy student in Canada. So why did I choose pharmacy? Because it was the earliest professional degree I could get. 
 To explain further, in Canada, the minimum requirement to get into pharmacy school is 2 years of undergrad. For comparison, dental, a few medical schools, and optometry require a minimum of 3 years. Most medical schools and law require a full undergrad degree. 
 I knew an undergrad degree is pretty much useless nowadays, so I knew I wanted a professional one ASAP without wasting time. The plan was to apply for pharm in 2nd year, and then everything else in 3rd and 4th year. I'm a pretty enthusiastic guy, so I've always felt that I could come to enjoy any one of those health professions so it was more of a job security thing than any other factor. Fortunately (or unfortunately?) I got accepted into pharmacy, and I took it and never looked back. 
 The unique thing about my program (University of Waterloo) is that it's a co-op program - meaning I rotate between academic rotations, and work rotations. In order to get our degree, we must have worked 16 months (must be full-time, must be paid), and we must fulfill certain requirements (e.g. rural area, underserved population, etc.). 
 I feel I have experienced a decent variety of positions (retail, hospital, family health team) so my opinion comes from a broad (albeit brief) exposure to many different aspects of pharmacy. 
 Do I like what I do? Yes, I do like it when I get to use my therapeutic knowledge, reassess patient drug therapy and optimize it. 
 But the problem is that the public/government/other healthcare practitioners don't really recognize it as helpful. Even though we can bill 30$ for a MedsCheck (Canadian MTM), it's not seen as a useful service on the whole. Also, when working on interprofessional teams, I felt that the pharmacist was always an afterthought and consulted really as a drug information source, and not an active practitioner in optimizing the patient's health experience. 
 So would I change anything? To be honest, I would probably go into medical school. This is particularly hard for me to say as I've managed to convince myself and probably fellow classmates too that I am perfectly content with pharmacy - I guess the truth always comes out on reddit :P 
 For me now, it's not about the money (though pharmacists have been cut HUGE - we're only 10$/hr higher than subway drivers now?), it's not about the job security (though shopper's drug mart doesn't hire full-time anymore in Toronto); it's about the respect. 
 It kind of bites knowing that all that knowledge we have (that we spent so much time accumulating and committing to memory) and all the problem-solving skills we practice (through exams, mock OSCEs), we must FIGHT hard to just be recognized as a valid resource. 
 So at the end of the day, I tell myself - as long as fight as hard as I can, and continue to be the best practitioner I can be, I WILL be recognized as an authority in my area (drugs) and garner that respect when I work on an interprofessional team.","Because it was fast to get into, I do like what I do, I would change how pharmacists are perceived by both the public and fellow healthcare practitioners.

"Ok, posting with a festive throwaway just in case. Anyway, my husband and I have a really great relationship/marriage, and we have two kids: a five-year-old and a two-year-old. I'm also four months pregnant with our third. 
 Despite being an atheist my husband LOVES Christmas. I'm not as into it, but hey, he makes it fun. But for some reason, decorating our Christmas tree is the area in which his worst, uncompromising tendencies come out. Husband thinks that the tree has to be decorated in a very exact way or else it will look horrible: very precise layers of glass ornaments, lights, and tinsel. And yeah, it does end up looking great in the end. 
 The problem is that he won't budge with his efforts to achieve the perfect tree for the kids or anything else. The five-year-old has been asking his father to help decorate the tree, but my husband says no, because our son doesn't know ""his system"". I'm definitely okay with our kids being told no, but the thing is I have so many fond memories of decorating my tree in a very non-precise, slapdash way with my parents. Those are some of my fondest memories from my childhood and I feel sad my son won't experience them because my husband needs to get something that only stays up for two months ""perfect"". Besides, I feel like Christmas is more about the kids than adults, and he's being oddly selfish. I told my husband this and in his characteristic, kind of assholish-humor way he said, ""Well, your tree must have looked like crap then."" I'm not offended because . . . it's a fucking Christmas tree, why does it matter so much??? But I guess that's the core issue. 
 Also, two years ago one of our cats ate some of the tinsel and almost died. I've begged my husband for two years to stop using tinsel. He refuses, saying the tree looks awesome with it on and that it's my job to prevent ""my"" cats from eating it then. First of all, we got the cats together. Second of all, I really don't want to add babysitting a couple of wily cats to my already very full plate. So that's irritating. 
 Finally, what made me want to post this was the other day. Our two-year-old daughter came home from preschool, having made some popsicle stick and macaroni art ornaments. Obviously they're not Thomas Kinkade quality pieces, but it's my kid's art, and I want to save it. I almost didn't get that chance, because I caught my husband trying to throw them out. When I freaked out at him, he said that they would never, ever go on the tree anyway because they look terrible so what's the point, and that I need to ""stop taking your pregnancy out on me"". YEAH. 
 The thing is I've known about this Christmas quirk ever since we were dating. And at first, I found it funny and weirdly endearing, and just gently ribbed him about it. And before we had kids, I was glad to let him go wild and have his fun. But now? He's being an inflexible asshole and weirdly selfish about something that doesn't even matter all that much (to me) anyway. But am I way off base here? Am I just being a nag and trying to prevent him from doing what he loves? Whenever I've tried to talk to him about this in the past, which has happened more than usual due to the whole cat thing, he gets indignant like I'm just trying to take something he enjoys away from him. That's why I'm posting this, to try and get some perspective from impartial people.

"Hi, everyone, thanks in advance for reading this! 
 My boyfriend Adam [22M] and I [18F] have been dating for two years. He lives an hour away, so our LDR isn't very long distance, but it still affects us as he's a student working his way through college, and I can't quite drive yet due to financial issues in my home (can't afford a car or insurance for myself). 
As my last year of high school is coming to a close, and I've applied to colleges, I've been starting to think about what our relationship would come to. I'm a firm believer and understand...er of the whole ""don't go to a school for your SO"" and that factor is not hindering my college decision in any way. However, my top and dream school happens to be within 10-20 minutes from him. It's also one of the nation's most ridiculously selective schools. 
Realistically, I will not be getting in that school, and I'll most likely be attending a college about 3 hours away from my hometown, so about 4 hours from him. We have discussed this, and came to the decision that it would be up to me at that point whether I wanted to continue the relationship or not. 
 The problem? I'm extremely curious, sexual, and I love people. 
This sounds pretty easy. I shouldn't have to sacrifice having a good time and experience in college for a boyfriend so far away, essentially putting my life on hold for him. 
However, I'm extremely attached to Adam. I love him dearly, and though we have our problems as in any other relationship, I can see myself being with him in the future/ living together because we work very practically as a couple (financially, lifestyle wise etc.). 
 We both discussed tonight that we'd like to explore other relationships. We both want to see what being with someone else is like (as each other's first relationship, we've been pretty limited), both to see more of what we need and like in people and so we can grow to appreciate each other more (e. g. maybe someone else I date wouldn't love me in the language that he does). We also both agreed that we'd like to ""come back"" to each other, as in live together in the future. 
 I have an extremely high libido and just an oversexual nature that requires a lot of attention and stimulation to be satisfied (a manifestation of some issues I faced as a child, I have seen counseling about this and it is largely not unhealthy). I know 100% that if I am far from my boyfriend in college and cannot see him regularly, I will have diverting thoughts and feel compelled to date/hook up with/explore other people. As I am also questioning my sexuality, I know for sure that with the freedom I have in college and without the distinct presence of my boyfriend, I will have a very difficult time staying loyal. 
 A friend (well, ex-friend in a way, we are no longer in contact) of mine introduced me to polyamory a while back, which I, out of curiosity, subsequently researched and explored as an idea. The concept actually came up in tonight's talk with Adam, and he seemed to share the curiosity that I feel towards it -- there was no indication that either of us would for sure be polyamorous. 
 I think something like polyamory would be a relatively good solution to my dilemma. Adam has expressed openness to this idea, and I'd like to bring some other possible solutions to the table for us to discuss. Whether you suggest an open relationship or that we just break up, I am receptive to any possibilities! 
 Thanks so much! 
 edit: to clarify, our discussion about exploring other relationships was not us saying that we no longer want to be together. we are both perfectly content with the way our relationship is at this present moment.","bf and I together two years, live an hour apart. I'm going to college soon, probably further away from him, feel like I'm gonna ""party"" it up bc I'm overly sexual and questioning my orientation. bf and I agree that we'd like to have a future together, but also agree that we'd like to try other people, have discussed polyamory. any other possible solutions?",18,F,relationships
"Throwaway of course) Hello to all you guys and gals taking the time to read this, I know you all have something better to do than to read this so I'll keep it as brief as I can. 
 Things have been pretty bad since a few years ago. I was in a really bad place and I started cutting. Fast forward a few years and things aren't much better. I learned how to pretended everything was okay , I learned how to try to fit in and I learned that people are way too busy with their own lives to give a damn about mine. 
 A few months ago I consulted my doctor for some help, because the cutting was getting so bad that I was leaving some real nasty scabs and scars on my upper thighs. I got scared because I actually ran out of room to cut. That's when I realised I desperately needed help. 
 I went to therapy for the mandatory 12 sessions, and I must say it was somewhat a waste of time. Yes, I did find out things I didn't really realise I knew/didn't really look into as well as I should of. Though it all just felt like a lie. I felt like she was judging me and I felt like I wasn't able to fully open up as much as I'd like to. 
 Pretty soon I held back everything and pretended like I was getting better. I told her that things were fine and I pretended that the cutting, the hurting and the regret wasn't really happening. 
 I should of realised back then that I was trying to convince myself that more than her. 
 That was all last year around September. I stopped visiting my GP and the moment my sessions were over I have to say was more relieved than ever that it was over. 
 It's now March, and things haven't changed. Actually, that's a lie. They have. They've gotten worse. I've once again run out of room to cut so I've moved on to other places, sometimes even opening up old wounds. 
 I had to see my GP again recently for personal reasons, he asked me how things were. I broke down and told him. God I've never felt so weak in my whole life. He said that he was going to write a letter back to my previous therapist and that I need to see her again for another 12 sessions. 
 So my question is this: should I go back to my GP, whom I haven't spoken to for around 3 weeks and then have to do the mandatory 12 sessions again? 
 What is your opnions on this? I really need some advice, anything would help. I'm just in a dark corner right now. Things aren't okay.","I've seen a therapist 12 times who did nothing and now my GP wants me to go again for another 12 sessions. Should I do it or..?

"So I'm 32m near a major city in the US. Me and my wife of nearly a decade have moved into a poly relationship. This was a mutual decision after we experienced first hand the obvious difficulties of creating a triad from nothing. 
 We both have profiles on OKC and as expected she is getting hit up constantly. Both guys and girls are taking her out and she is having a great time. I'm honestly happy that she is enjoying this experience, but I'm far from it. 
 Everyone I've contacted has either not written me back or flat out refuses this type of relationship. I'll point out that I'm only contacting women who have some indication on their profile that they are open to the idea of poly. I will also say and will probably be told on here that it is wayyyyy too early to begin being depressed about the lack of options. We've officially been looking for two weeks. I just feel like I've expended my potential options on OKC without driving some unreasonable distance to meet someone. 
 We've both agreed that either of us can pull the plug at anytime. But doing so now will mean that she is hurt and I can't say that will make me feel any better. 
 I'm definitely envious of the attention she has received. I don't know how to cope with it. For whatever reason this has impacted my work, school, and home life with my family. The only person I can talk to about it is my wife. She is very supportive.

"Me: 21/M Her: 19/F Lets call her Alex. Alex is the best friend of my best friends girlfriend. We have met each other three times, each time we get along great, have loads of fun, I catch her gazing at me all the time, she ignores everyone in the room for me. About a week and a half ago we run into each other while out on the town, hit it off and end back up at my house. The next day while cuddling in bed she says multiple times that she doesn't want to leave and shows me loads of affection. I eventually make her leave because she has class that day. I waited one day before contacting her, we then text every day for four days, stop, start again and then it stopped again. We've had 0 contact since and I'm curious as to what I've done wrong. 
 I've recently come out of a 2 year relationship, my best friends gf didn't know this and I believe she told Alex I had a gf because the contact between us stopped for a day (I told the best friends gf that I was single just in case). The next day Alex apologized and continued contact for another day and then suddenly nothing. 
 So, Alex probably thinks I broke up with my ex for her, which is not the case. I've just been keen to get to know her better and see where it takes us. I am completely over my ex. I'm not really looking for a relationship at the moment but am open to it. What is your opinion Reddit? Have I frightened her off because I've seemed too keen somehow, because she maybe thinks I broke it off with the ex for her or maybe some other reason? What do I do??? I am greatly confused.

"Last fall I decided that come spring, I wanted to play rugby. I am 6'1"" and at the time I weighed about 170 lbs. I was told it would probably be a good idea to try get up near 185 (by putting on healthy, lean muscle). I was already a pretty avid soccer player, so the running wasn't really an issue. 
 I worked my ass off to put those 15 pounds on. 4 visits to the gym a week, playing soccer twice a week to keep up my conditioning / endurance, and an extreme overhaul of my nutritional habits (had to start taking in a  ton  of extra protein and other health supplements). It was really a struggle to commit myself to eating as much as I needed to (5-7 small meals a day) and choke down terrible tasting protein bars and protein shakes in between. 
 After about 4 months of all of this, I managed to put the 15 pounds on, and it was almost all good strong muscle. I looked bigger and felt bigger, stronger, and more energetic. People kept commenting about how good the extra weight looked on me, and it really made me feel good about myself. 
 I joined the rugby team and had a blast learning and playing the sport. I was a terrible rookie and I made all kinds of mistakes, but my team was very encouraging and supportive, and none of my mistakes were due to a lack of strength, size, or conditioning. 
 Near the end of the season, I separated my shoulder. If you've never had a shoulder separation before, your arm attached to that shoulder is basically out of commission for anything that requires heavy lifting, moving your arm above your head, or force requiring your shoulder to be in certain positions for 1-2 weeks (sometimes more depending on the grade of the separation). I couldn't prop myself up in bed (just ask my girlfriend when I inadvertently put too much pressure on my shoulder and had to recoil and catch myself with the other hand and ended up punching her in the stomach), pick up things more than 10 pounds or at certain angles, etc. For the first week, when I sat down at my desk at work, I literally had to lift my right arm with my left arm and place it on the keyboard so I could work. But I digress... 
 I had to rest it to let it heal, so I wasn't able to go to the gym at all (even doing leg exercises requires the use of your arm / shoulder most of the time for balance and support). After two weeks of inactivity, I had dropped 8-10 pounds back off. That's basically 2-3 months of work down the drain.

"Me (26F) him, (27m)- throwaway account since we are both redditors. We have been going out since August 2010. We did break up once for 8 weeks in February 2011 and then got back together, due to the same fighting pattern - I will describe below. 
 Basically, my boyfriend and I keep having the same fight over and over and I need to know whether or not it is worth it to keep going or if I should just cut my losses. I love him so much but all of our fights usually end with him and I not speaking for a few days, I get so angry that he won't speak to me, give in first and communicate/call - and then we resolve things with him saying he will try to work on things. Here is the thing- its not really improving. Also, I have told him how hurt it makes me when he cuts all communication after a fight and refuses to talk to me. It hurts like crazy and it makes me feel like he doesn't care at all about me. He agrees it wasn't the best approach, but he does it over and over again. I love this person with all my heart but, at the end of the day - if its wrong to expect someone to change- should I just cut my losses and move on? 
 For a long time now, I have had issues with my boyfriend refusing to do social things with me, whether its going out to a movie, going to socialize with my friends or family, etc. Because of this, and despite the rest of our relationship being great imo, my friends and family still don't know him very well and I get more and more resentful that my boyfriend won't be ""normal"" and do social things with me. 
 Keep in mind, I am a homebody and am more often than not satisfied with staying in, watching him play games, watching a show, etc. 
 He also has social anxiety (physical signs of which I've seen including sweaty palms, nervousness), and I know that this is part of the problem - but I also thing that if he gets to know my friends and family, they will no longer feel like strangers and he will therefore be more comfortable around them - maybe even making some new friends. 
 My boyfriend and I got in a big fight the other day because I suggested wanting to go see a movie on a Saturday night. He told me he had too much studying to do- which was funny, since we had had plans to go to a movie with his friend before - but it was cancelled, and he was totally willing to spend his time/money with his friend but not just with me. 
 His excuses range from school work, getting up early for work, not having money (although I offer to cover him enough), or just being too tired. In my opinion, he is making up excuses to avoid having to go out anywhere with me. 
 When I ask him why he is okay to go out drinking with his friends during the week, he gets angry and says that he sacrifices so much of his social time to be with me instead - but always avoids my point that his social anxiety is not stopping him from going out other times. 
 Then there is the way our fights always go- I wait for him to call or text me - for 48 hours or longer he doesn't - then when I finally give in, contact him - extremely angry and hurt- he goes on the defensive - making me feel like I am overreacting. 
 Eventually - I wonder why- I let things go when he promises to work on this. But, its like pulling teeth every.single.time I don't want to sit on a couch. 
 Reddit- what do I do? I truly believe that he loves me, and we have a great relationship and I love being with him when we don't have this problem, but I am a 26 year old woman who wants to start thinking about marriage and kids by the time I am 30. Another thing is he recently told me he's not sure he wants kids, but he will let me know when he's sure so I don't ""Waste my childbearing years"". 
 I am so torn. It seems like an easy decision but its not. How can I get him to understand that 
a) his fighting etiquette is unacceptable and it needs to stop
b) hanging out with my friends and family is necessary if he wants to be in a relationship with me, and also that it is necessary for MOST people. 
 Thank you for any insight or advice,","I love my boyfriend and we have a great relationship, except when I suggest going out and being social, then he comes up with bullshit excuses and then ignores me and gives me the silent treatment until I give in and try to resolve things like adults. What do I do to get through to him or am I wasting my time?** 
 EDIT -  UPDATE :  Spoke to my boyfriend last night, after leaving him 2 calls and a text. He told me that he texted me 3 hours after our fight on Sat - therefore trying NOT to give me the silent treatment. I never received this text. He re-sent it right away. Since I haven't seen his phone, I can't check when the text was originally sent- but I am compelled to believe him that he did send me one. Second, I told him what I needed. I need for him to go out with me when I ask him to, whether its myself, or friends and family. He explained that the problem is twofold: He does not enjoy going out and being social. He doesn't see the value/need of this. However, he has told me in the past that for me, he is  willing* to do it, because he knows it is important to me. Second, since we have dated he has had limited income, as a student living on his own and working a retail job part time. He explained that this strain further adds to the desire to stay home. I never understood this because I also worked and went to university and still made time for friends. That being said, I am more extroverted than he is. He graduates in three weeks, and feels like he would be more open to going out when he is working full time and has more expendible income. I argued that if it's not school/money, it will be something else- like being ""too tired"" after work. He says this isn't the case (I am very skeptical). We ended the conversation with him saying that he is also tired of this fight, and of me ""nagging"", and maybe it is time we thought about moving on. We are both going to take time to think about whether we should continue the relationship. For me, it is also a major fact that he's decided he doesn't want to have kids, and if we do end up breaking up, it would be more this issue than anything, but as others have said, him refusing to do these things with me consistently throughout the relationship has left me very resentful. We both expressed the desire to not break up, but, I am at least relieved that he is taking this seriously. Thank you all for your comments/help.**",26,F,relationships

 Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy having sex with her, I'm just looking for some advice on how I could spice it up and make things a little more exciting for both of us.

"Hi all I'm a 17 year old male who is trying to become very physically fit.  I am not necessarily looking for just muscle gain and lifting greater weights, I am more concerned with my actual biological fitness. 
 Recently I came across the idea of IF(intermittent fasting).  I have seen many reports saying that this is a healthy thing to do for specifically fat loss and apparently has other health benefits.  So I am wondering if I should begin doing IF and if so then how should I go about this?  Should I work out while in fasting?","how should I go about IF(intermittent fasting)?

"First off; I am a 15 year-old closet Atheist. However, out of no where, my mother begins talking extraordinarily religious working on Bible activities for Children's Church tomorrow, and began telling me all about Jesus and how he was great and I replied, 
 ""Do we actually have any evidence that Jesus even looked the way he did? Could he have been bald, or have a goatee?"" 
 She was ignoring me at this point so I pressed further, 
 ""And something else that was interesting to me that at the time of Jesus, around five other people were calling themselves the 'Son of God,' such as the Roman Emperor, who was given his title through God-given-right. So if someone else other than Jesus said he was the Son, would they have followed him just as well?"" 
 She seemed rather irritated about this and replied about how Jesus had performed miracles, and I replied saying that all of his stories were written by priests some 200 years after Jesus even died. Obviously she was then pissed, really pissed, and raised her tone saying, ""You're sounding like a Heathen! Just proof we need to take you to Church more!,"" or something along those lines. 
 The argument then moved onto how those who die under other religious people other than the Monotheists were condemned to hell for being non-faithful to a ""One True God"". I kept batting her back at each turn and she became ever more pissed about it.
It got especially dangerous when arguing about Faith while I picked at how rationality falls apart when adhered to Faith.
I essentially won the argument while displaying myself as faltering in faith rather than a full blown atheist, so I think I escaped burning myself as I went. 
 I'm now asking for others to tell their stories and offer any advice as to what I should do next. 
 Further details will be added if requested.",I am a closet atheist that won my very first religious argument with my mother without revealing I am truly an atheist. Now seeking advice as to what I should do next.,15,M,atheism
"Brace yourselves, because this will be long winded, but i'll try keep it as easy to read as possible.
Brief background info: 
 -I'm 25 years old 
 -I have lived with two grandparents for the last decade (they're mid 70s now) I think part of the problem is living with them for so long & missing out on many ""youthful"" things, not sure. 
 -I live in a small town in the UK, literally nothing going on & I hate living in the UK 
 -I graduated with a degree in Accounting in 2013, but quickly discovered I hate most of the topic & absolutely do not want to work in this for ""insert however many decades"" 
 -I currently work at a public accounting practice... 
 Alright, so my life has had ups & downs so far like everyone elses I suppose. I made mistakes & missed out on some opportunities along the way.
I was also unemployed from graduation until November 2014 due to it being seemingly impossible to actually get work. 
 My overall aspiration since I was young was to live in North America, Ideally the US & in California if I could be picky, but that is worlds away & I'm already 25 so if I ever did get there (probably take years), I wouldn't be able to enjoy it the same as a early 20s version of myself. I was never a person with a goal for a certain career path, I did my degree because of past mistakes & felt accounting would be a good backup if another recession hit.
Now, everyday I go to work, come home & sit playing video games until the next day. I live for the weekends even though I don't do anything on them, I just feel free. I absolutely hate 9-5 & have been mulling over entrepreneurship or passive income possibilities in the background but have no clue where or how to start.
Gaming is something I have done since I was about 4 or 5, & it just kept my mind off the childhood struggles (Yes bad childhood, abuse, but I don't think I regret it, or that it affected me too badly) & is something that I know is probably not a good thing anymore, but I thoroughly enjoy it. Whenever I game I am completely absorbed & forget all other issues. 
 Now, I should explain, while I like the idea of a relationship or casual relationships, I have been pretty strict on myself & have not wanted to risk getting into a relationship due to the possibility of ""accidentally"" having a kid, or moving into a place, or whatever else & being stuck here forever! I have kept myself free of a lot of things that would tie me down to the UK, in case I get a chance to leave. 
 Now for the chance... 
the IEC program, something I came across last year and have been actively following & using to try & make myself feel better psychologically. IEC would allow me to move somewhere in Canada ( I would probably go to Toronto as I have a friend there & it's a big multicultural city) for 12 months and work in whatever I can get. I believe as a UK citizen we can do this twice, & assuming I did 2 years in a row, I would be trying to get permanent residency after that through PNP. 
 Sounds like a decent plan in some ways, except that if I move there, I would be quite likely to be working in something even worse than what I do now, with my age increasing. I believe in my mind, or hope that moving to a place like Toronto might help me branch out more & be ""happier"". I am not afraid of meeting new people at all, and have always loved being the ""leader"" or ""centre"" of groups. In some ways I am reclusive right now by choice and location. 
 My real problems I think are deeper than what I can actually see, but I know that I am afraid of being trapped in 9-5 work for decades as I believe 9-5 is an antiquated, nonsense way to live & if I had a true idea which I thought could fund a lifestyle on my own terms, I would pursue that instead of the traditional rat race.
I'm not lazy if I find something I really care about, for instance I somehow got a job reporting on F1 travelling around I would absolutely put tonnes of hours in & it wouldn't be work, or something related to gaming, things that I care about right now. But If I am in something I absolutely do not care about, then I probably am lazy or ""least amount of effort required"" and unmotivated because I hate a lot of menial nonsense. 
 Anyway, with what feels like no direction in my life & lots of time wasted I figured i'd post on a few places & try to get some feedback from people who may have some things figured out.
The IEC thing I could realistically do in 6 months (If I get a space).
Bizarrely enough I was far happier being unemployed playing VGames, or when I was a student & had time to game, than I am now feeling trapped. 
 Part of the reason for wanting to do the IEC is the a vague hope for self discovery. Another reason is because I feel unfulfilled, I have no idea what my real purpose is yet & feel like venturing to a different country might help me find it. 
 Also I am ENTP on the myers-briggs test if that helps at all... I am pretty jaded, don't tend to show emotion a lot of the time these days for all kinds of reasons.","1st world problems, all psychological, probably a mental case.

"I am having so much trouble finding love. I live at home, I'm 28 and have 3 close friends who are all married. I endured the messiest breakup of my life earlier this year with a guy I was only with a few weeks. Second breakup of the year; I broke up with my long term boyfriend in January after an operation. He didn't even bother turning up to the hospital. 
 I have only recently deleted my online dating apps because I got sick of being ghosted and guys only wanting sex. I started talking to a guy I dated briefly in high school who is single again. I want to go back and kick my 16 year old self in the ass because he's such a lovely person. 
 I don't even know how to broach the subject with him, eg: giving it another shot. How do I even ask? It's been 12 years. He's adorable and coming back to my town in a couple of weeks after living 3 hours away. He's agreed to meet up with me again, which is exciting. 
 All my friends are married, have kids and always tell me it will happen one day. I get tired of it because they share happy family photos, in daily life and cute Santa pics, have bday parties for their kids and I feel so alone. I have no one to share those moments with as a wedding and kids are a distant dream. 
 It's consuming my life and I don't know how to make it stop. I don't want to obsess over finding a family, but I can't consciously change how I feel or think. I'm hoping I can meet with my old friend and see what happens. 
 I sometimes break down over it and cry. Food doesn't taste the same, and my life feels unfulfilled. I see women getting married, engaged and pregnant and I have nothing. I live at home with my parents, I work part time and I have 2 dogs. I don't see my friends often because they have commitments with their families.

"Hi r/drugs 
 A couple of summers ago, I was in a pretty bad place. I moved across the country a year and a half before because I had hit a dead end in my life. Before I moved, I was introduced to drugs for the first time in my life (early-mid 20's at this time). As a result, I went balls out, taking MDMA at least twice a week, and cocaine at least that much, if not more. It wasn't a pretty sight. I moved to get away from all of that. 
 But, I ended up becoming entrenched further than I could have imagined. 2 months after moving, I had my first experience with LSD, and it changed everything. I inadvertently roped in a friend (roped may be unfair, he was pretty willing) and off I went, hell bent on doing as much drugs, as many different kinda of drugs, and as often as I could. Things felt stable--it was mostly just a lot of killer bud, acid, and shrooms. 
 But then I got a connection for coke and sketchy M caps, and exuberance took hold, not to mention an underlying lack of regard for myself--if I died, well, such as life. 
 So started the MDMA bender, which was certainly
not pure by any means. I knew this, but didn't care. 2, 3, sometimes 4 nights a week I would take these caps, party, not sleep, go to work. I didn't understand serotonin syndrome or anything of that sort at the time. I just wanted to feel good, or not feel at all. 
 At it's peak, my friend and I would take between 3 to 4 caps of this stuff. I remember the ends of the night, overstimulated and under energetic. I remember wondering on which of these nights would I have my last roll. It never happened and I'm thankful for that. When it was all said and done, I fell into the worst depression I could have ever imagined (and I am already predisposed to it). 
 Months passed and I finally started to gain control on my life again, only to pick up a coke habit that was even worse (but that's another story). I digress (I'm high). 
 My main point and question was throughout that MDMA binge, I remember it being characteristically rife with intense craving and desire to consume more. Why is that? What might I have been taking? I have had pure (or at least very high qualify M) and I know that it is worlds apart from what I was doing at that time. 
 I learned a lot about myself, about drugs, and about the places I could have ended up.

"This is a big one and Ive never really spoken about it because I always feel like its my lame issue I need to get over. ""grow some bualls"", etc. Especially since a lot of this is informed by my past which I very rarely like to discuss or even remember half of the time (I cant tell a story for shit- even the stuff that actually is/was interesting) 
 So heres the deal. I have always had the flat-worst luck with women. I know what you're thinking, internet ""nice guy, fedora blah blah blah"". Not the case. I'd been routinely turned down by any girl I had interest up until 10th grade (kid shit, who cares. But the girls I went to school with werent exactly pleasant about it). Towards the end of that year I began dating a girl in my highschool- things were great for years until a couple months before my 20th birthday she dumped me and no less than 6 days later was already seeing someone else. This cut really deep and I wasnt able to get over it for years afterwards (we're actually friends now, no resentment towards her whatsoever- anymore). I tried to get back out  there in the game during college but was faced with 7 years of the same as before. And what relationships I had were fleeting, if not abusive. To point: 
 3 Months with a girl with a history of sexual abuse from her own parents- and I couldnt possibly ask her to put that kind of trauma away for me, but she couldnt get past it either. 
 2 Months with an asexual who I swear has that disorder where she cant feel romantic love. She's married now and she's never been affectionate with her own husband 
 and 1 month with the single worst girl Ive ever met in my life. A bipolar mess that intentionally fucked with my heart and my mind. Who tried the break-up-no-now-I-want-you-back. (I decided we should stay broken up) Borderline stalker, long distance to boot. 
 'one month' was enough to shatter the very desire to date for a good 1.5 years afterwards (yeah, that bad) 
 So now here I am, Christmas time again with absolutely no prospects. I barely meet girls, of the ones I barely meet, few I really like, fewer I have the courage to ask out. 0 luck with any of them. 
 [Its at this point in writing Im starting to feel like this is all sounding really fucking stupid. Well reddit, looks like you'll be getting all my crazy for Christmas- ToB]","The bottom line of this is: As much as I want to be in a relationship and even as I continue to pursue -certain- women, Ive been so conditioned to give up now that at the slightest bump I just start to chemically lose interest.

 So I was sitting at my desk in my room, looking at some texts I had just received from my friend.  He had sent me a funny video of a couple of my other friends, but that's irrelevant to the story.

 I am currently an 18 year old high school senior who is attending school in Georgia, which you all know as the ""Bible Belt"", I also happen to be an atheist. My parents raised me to be an open-minded individual and to always care for others and to show compassion and understanding for people that are different than you. Tolerance was just something that I understood growing up, especially since I am a member of an all white family and I have an adopted black sister, but I digress. 
 I love having the opportunity to live in a GREAT school district, with intelligent, understanding teachers. I feel very ""modern"", if that makes sense in that I have the resources and the ability to ask any sort of questions I want to, but recently I have noticed something that I felt was wrong. 
 I am taking an astronomy class in my high school because I've always had an interest in that sort of thing, I really find it mindblowing how insignificant we are as a single planet among the vast ever-expanding universe. This interest in astronomy I have had since I was a child is also a part of the reason why I am atheist as well. Come to find out, when I told my dad I was atheist at about the age of 13, I find that both my parents are also atheists! How wonderful for me, supportive parents who have similar fundamentals! I can go to them for anything and they always show me love and support for me and my sister. 
 Recently in this astronomy class I was assigned a paper to explain the difference between the formation of the inner/outer planets. Upon researching for this paper, I come across a website that is blocked for ""Alternative spirituality/beliefs"". Alright, I'm curious now. I ask my teacher (Who I'm also fairly certain is an atheist) what this means. ""Alternative to what?"" I asked. I thought we were in a modern society where it is understood that others have different beliefs than whatever the ""Core value system"" was. I suppose it could be a lot worse, we could be learning intelligent design in our schools, but I was shocked at the lack of tolerance it seemed I was experiencing. 
 So after seeing this website I do a little experimenting. I know that www.reddit.com is not a blocked website at our school, just sites like imgur and YouTube and things that actually stream media. So I attempt to go to r/atheism, that I am I frequent visitor and subscriber to. I open up the page only to find out that it is blocked under the same category! Okay, this was to be expected, so I attempt to go to r/Christianity, and low and behold, it's not blocked. 
 Wtf, school system? Is this because  /r/Christianity  is a less popular subreddit? Or is because of the Bible Belt bias that Georgia school system may have? 
 Now my questions for you, Reddit: 
 
 What can I do about this? I'm just a kid, could what I say possibly make a difference? 
 
 Are there any people specifically that I can go to about this? 
 
 Am I the only one who has seen or experienced this? 
 
 What other biases have you seen before?","My school blocks things with a heavy Christian bias.

"This actually happened last night but in the midst of me being like ""holy fuck I can't believe I just did that"" and me being extremely tired, posting this on Reddit wasn't exactly my first thought. 
 Background : I am 17 years old and a senior in high-school. I have been talking to this girl for about 60 days straight now, so I know quite a bit about her. We aren't necessarily ""talking"" but we flirt a lot. I have a pretty bad memory, hence why I fucked up last night. 
 So I was Snapchatting this girl, you know, doing the usual testosterone-heavy high-school boy thing and being a fiend. 
 Obviously I didn't remember this at the time, but now I specifically remember a conversation I had with this girl. We were talking on the phone and we got into the discussion about what race/ethnicity we were. She guessed mine and I was guessing hers. I guessed German and she responded with ""Why would I be German? I'm Jewish"". I laughed and said ""you right you right"" and moved on. God I wish I remembered this conversation. 
 Fast forward to about 11pm last night. I do this thing where I send the same snapchat of my shirt-less self every night and say ""Damn i'm fat"", mostly just as an  excuse . She often responds with something like ""You're not fat at all you have a nice body"" which obviously sets me up for a quick reply of ""you have a better body"" or something of the sort. I'm literally just one big  hornball . This particular night, she is snapchatting me while she is in the shower. As you can guess, this got my hormones raging and my mind was instantly replaced by my dick. I quickly began the shirtless selfies and the fuckboy talk. Things are going good, she looks hot as shit. Fast forward about 10 minutes, I had to go to the bathroom to pee, and that is when I remembered I should send the traditional ""I'm fat"" thirst-trap selfie. Perfect opportunity since she was in the shower, right? But this time, I combined the selfie with a caption that was meant to be funny. As you can guess, this is where the fuck up occurs. Out of all the picture/caption combinations that are possible in this giant world full of endless possibilities, I choose to suck in my stomach as hard as I could like  this . What a fucking idiot. Needless to say, she did not find it funny. I was left, shirtless and vulnerable, wondering why this girl had ignored my seemingly hilarious picture. Fast-forward to about 30 minutes later. I get a text from her best-friend, ""Did you really send that picture to  girl's name . I replied ""yes hahaha wasn't it funny"". She replies with two words, yet these two words carried enough weight to make my stomach drop as hard as a fat man diving for a donut. ""She's Jewish..."".

"To start off, My doctor is no help, He sees no problem with my current birth control so I'm looking to get some information before I go and find a  new doctor so I know what I should be asking about and looking for. 
 I am 24, Female, (95kg) I suffer Vulvodynia (VVS) and I am completely numb downstairs except for pain. I am currently taking Nordette/Monofeme Combination pill in a 21,7 cycle. I withdrawl bleed for 14 days. 
 I was diagnosed with PMDD at 12, and PCOS at 14, I am unable to carry full term due to a hip deformity, but I am fertile in 1 ovary, I can not have kids, I do not want kids. I am mostly looking for birth control as a method of stopping my periods. But I am nervous about the state of my Hormones, I remember how hard it was Pre-Birth control. I never want to go back to that. 
 When I was 12 I was given depo provera for 1 year, I bled 27 days, then a 14 day break. I recieved a Mirina IUD when I was 14, I bled non stop for 6 months and was hospitalised 7 times for the pain, and black outs it caused. I was on several brands on seasonal and 21,7 pills, Including Yaz, Ella and Levora before finding nordette the best. 
 HOWEVER. My periods are still bad, I loose motor function in my legs, black out and loose my vision on top of the regular PMS and Period pain symptoms. 4-6 days of my period I would define myself as a vegetable. On top of that comes the PMT and mental strain, I'mm tired, I am sick of it. In my Period-crazed stupidity I have attempted suicide multiple times. I have regretted it and thanked god I failed as soon as My period stops. I am afraid of my own uterus.

"So I've owned the Flip Hole White for a long time - about 2.5 years. I got it as a present for myself - my first toy - right as I entered university, and here I am, 2.5 years later, and the FHW is on its last legs, so I thought I may as well do a review for all you guys (and girls?) out there who might be considering getting one. At the time, the only options were the White and the Black (there's a Red and Silver now, too, I think), and I got the White because it was the ""softer"" one. 
 About me, I'm a 20 year old Canadian-born Chinese guy. My dick's about average at 5.5-5.7 inches depending on the day, and it's not terribly thick. Note that the recommended number of uses before throwing out is about 50 - I've owned this for 2.5 years at a usage rate of about 1.5 times per week, which puts me at 195 uses. 
 Design and Build Quality 
 Positives: First off, I really like the design aesthetic. From what I remember, Tenga designed it not to mimic a vagina, but crafted it simply as a male pleasure device. It's great - it looks kind of space-agey and vaguely technology-ish enough that, when closed, doesn't resemble anything sexual. I had it on my desk in my dorm room for 4 months, and no one batted an eye at it. However, when it's drying on the stand, it's a bit more conspicuous due to the textures of the inside. 
 How it actually works is fairly interesting - there's a plastic clasp-type device that serves both to lock the foldable halves together, and acts as a drying stand. It might take a try or three to get it on/balance the halves on it for drying, but eventually you get used to it. The whole thing has got a little bit of heft to it, so those who don't masturbate much or don't have much forearm strength may have a little trouble, and you won't be able to go at it at the maximum speeds you're used to while wanking normally. 
 The three ""buttons"", though they're not really buttons - it's one large plastic plate that you can squeeze at different spots and give you some control over the tightness and suction. More on this later. The inner portion has had almost no change to it, aside from some slight discolouration. 
 For criticisms: The hinge that holds the halves together has gotten a little loose over the years, so sometimes I'll have to manually align the halves before using the clasp. In addition, I've noticed the amount of suction I can get now isn't nearly as much as I could have gotten when the toy was new. Also, the inner material isn't perfectly fused to the outer plastic shell, so moisture and such can get into the spaces between - small black spots started to show up underneath (not inside) the inner material, which was one of the reasons I've decided to retire it. 
 Overall, for the amount that I've used it, it's held up really damn well.  8/10. 
 How it Feels 
 This is the real meat of the review. How does it actually feel? Let's set some benchmarks. On a scale of 10, 0 would be ""I feel nothing"", 3 would be ""Not bad"", 5 would be ""Hey, this feels pretty good"", 7 would be ""This is great!"" and 10 would be ""Holy fuck this is blowing my mind it's so good"". I've split up the benchmarks into two parts - During, and Orgasm, simply because I feel like they're separate measurements. I also put a range because as I'm sure all of you know, some days just feel better than others. 
 My Hand: During - (2 - 4), Orgasm (4 - 6) Usually pretty boring, but consistent. Nothing bad to say here. 
 Oral sex: During - (6 - 8), Orgasm (7 - 9) I love oral. Blowjobs are my absolute favourite. 
 Sex with a Condom: During - (4 - 8), Orgasm (N/A) I've never actually been able to come with a condom on. I've tried a few types - the worst one being some weird no name brand where I could barely feel anything, and the best being Trojan Bareskins, which I quite like. I've been planning on trying Kimono Microthins and Crowns to see if there's any difference. 
 Unfortunately I've never had any experience with bareback sex because of my absolute hatred of young children, so I've got no data for you guys to compare against there. So where does the Tenga fall? 
 During: (7 - 9) Orgasm (7 - 8) 
 The FHW is really smooth, just make sure both the insides and your dick itself is lubed.  Take a look at this picture.  of your dick. The Quattro Wave, and Click Orb are nice, but not spectacular. I'm not even sure the End Orb does anything - I've tried opening it up and jamming my dick head in there, but I barely feel anything. 
 I think one of the best parts is just how many ways you can use it. From almost all methods, you can squeeze the buttons to achieve different effects. The bottom button will make the entrance really tight. The middle button will tighten it up overall (though I'm not actually much of a fan of this, I feel it mutes the sensation somewhat). The top button squeezes out excess air, and letting go will make the toy suck on you a bit. There's the standard configuration, with the clasp on, and the side that says ""Flip Hole"" facing you (this means the back of your dick is on the left half, and the top is under the right half), which is simple and effective. Using it upside down (with ""Tenga"" facing you) is nice, but I don't think it's quite as good. What's really good, surprisingly, is having your dick all the way inside, and spinning it. It's a really unique sensation that I haven't been able to replicate with my hands. Also good is using it sideways - so the left and right sides of your dick each get one half of the textures. My absolute favourite, though, is not actually using the clasp - if you're okay with lube leaking out (I mostly use it in the bath), using it in the standard configuration is amazing because this way you have WAY more control over tightness and the like. 
 Heating both the toy and your lube up in a bath of hot water will make the experience much, much better. 
 You have to be careful to have enough lube, though. Not using enough may lead to orgasms that are too sensitive, and it's overwhelming to move around while you're cumming. 
 All in all, the FHW delivers a really consistent feeling that's way better than your hands both during and leading up to an orgasm. I got it for something like $80 and free shipping while they had a deal on, and at about 40 cents a jerk, I think it's pretty great value. If it actually only lasted the 50 uses that Tenga recommends, though, I would have been much more hesitant about recommending it. 
 After much consideration, my next toy is going to be a Meiki Zhang Xiao Yu, so if I feel like it, I'll post a first impressions review once it comes in (about a week or so from now).","It's pretty fucking great, and it lasts a fair bit longer than how long the company claims it lasts for. 8/10.

"So, this gal has returned to work, position:  Marketing Manager, after taking time off to get her MBA in Marketing.  I've already set up her new computer, but I joined the organization while she was on hiatus.  New (or returning) users are asked to contact IT on Day 1, so we can tell them their new password(s).  We had already set up a new computer for her, logged in as her, setup email and printers - so, it was just a matter of telling her the password. 
 She calls, I give her the password, but she can't get logged in, and sounds a little desperate.  Since she's only 1 floor above me in the building, I go up to introduce myself to a semi-big cheese. 
 I walk into her office, introduce myself, and ask her what isn't working. 
 She says, ""Well, I can't figure out how to login to this thing."" 
 I explain, ""Oh, that's easy, just put the mouse pointer where it says 'username', click, and type 'marketingderpette'."" 
 She says, ""How do I do that?""  I query, ""Do what?"" 
 ""Put the mouse pointer there?"" 
 ... I say, ""Well, you know, grab the mouse and move the pointer to the line..."" 
 ""How do I do that?"" 
 I point at the mouse, ""The mouse, you know, right there."" 
 She says, ""Oh,  that's  a mouse?  I've  never used one  before."" 
 Now, granted, she's a lot older than I was, but I pause, thinking, '... is it April Fool's Day?  Nope, middle of August...' 
 So, I replay the question, ""You've never used a mouse before,  never ?"" 
 ""No, this is my first time using a computer."" 
 OMG, I control the urge to roll my eyes, but have to ask, ""I thought you just got out of school for your MBA in Marketing?"" 
 ""Yes, today is my first day back."" 
 I try to hold back the incredulousness, ""Umm, and you didn't use a computer at  any time  in a modern university to get your MBA?"" 
 ""No, it was all classroom, and I just wrote everything because I hate computers."" -- ('wrote' as in  handwritten papers ) 
 Mr. Patient Tech Guy continues, ""Okay, well, I'll log you in... there we go.  I usually have people play the card game Solitaire, if they're new to using a mouse.  If anybody asks why you're playing Solitaire, tell them you have my permission to."" 
 I open Solitaire. 
 She stares at it for a few seconds, then says, ""I don't know how to play Solitaire."" 
 I manage to maintain my composure, and say, ""Oh, okay - well, gotta go!  Welcome back, nice to meet ya!"" and walk out of her office... 
 She sweetly replies, ""Oh, okay, nice to meet you too!"" 
 ... and I go to her superior's office, and tell the whole story.  He explained, ""... she's pretty old..."" and requested I teach her how to use a computer.  &#3232;_&#3232; 
 I replied that isn't my job, and suggest he find a local computer training school, and fast. 
 Then I add, ""... and I really have to wonder if she has the necessary skill set to do this job.  Heck, have you even confirmed her recent 'MBA' graduation?"" 
 He hadn't.  They did keep her on.  One of her subordinates had to train her new boss how to use a computer in the year 2005.  Marketing experienced some turnover after that.","new boss comes in, has never used a computer, doesn't know how to Solitaire",20,F,talesfromtechsupport
"What cookie says. 
 It makes me super sad though. I didn't lose my virginity until 20 days before I turned 19 (Note so I don't seem like OAG here - I only remember that because that date is also my first ex's birthday). 
 But, even with ""good"" education for sex ed there is still tons of misinformation because it doesn't want to upset parents by teaching kids how to be safe. What I remember from my high school is that anal has no chance of pregnancy, oral can't pass STDs, that only fully straight and fully gay are your sexualities, polyamorous/open relationships don't exist, only condoms and the pill will prevent pregnancy, ad infinitum bullshit. 
 My school at least mentioned to take the birth control pill every day, and someone I went to high school with called me sobbing one day because her period was one (1!) day late and she's like ""You wanna be a midwife, you're from a family of nurses, you must know!""

"First of all sorry for my English. it is not my first language.
About me: I'm 26M, single since my first/only/last relationship of like 5 years, 2 years ago. Since then I have tried to met some girls but for me meeting/talking to new people (male or female) is very difficult for me. 
 This start like one month ago when I went to a shop to to have some work done, I had never previously enter that shop because they do a very specific kind of job and I din't need it and really I don't have any more excuses to go inside. Also this shop is really small its only her and her boss. I went 3 or 4 times because of the work I needed, once she was alone, other they were both and other the boss was alone. 
 There I met this girl that is doing an internship and I really kinda like her (also i don't event know her name), it's like I have a crush on her and I have been thinking on her for this month. I don't want to go inside and be like: Hi sorry to come to your work place and can I have your number to maybe go drink something. there also the possibility that if I go inside I'll met her boss an be like: Hi, ho shes not here. and ask her boss about her name and maybe her phone number? 
 I know this shop is going to close soon, like before next week maybe, and more likely she will end her internship at this date. I have been trying to met her casually on the street but it seems that I have never been in the good place at the good moment. Monday I saw her went Went inside a store near her work place. I was waiting in the cashier line ans comes, ask the person before me and grab something from the shelf. , she was leaving and I froze. I saw her fade away. Later I was like: you moron, you should have said something.  I think this week might be my last chance. I'm thinking on going today after my work to wait for her but if I do, I might froze again and I don't want to look like a stalker. 
 How should I proceed?

"Sorry about the title, but I wasn't sure what else could properly get the point across. 
 My FSIL, currently, is not doing as well as she should be. We know she smokes pot (which otherwise we would not have a problem with, but this is to an extreme) and my FMIL found a mirror, spoon and straw in her room last week (coke?). She has lost so much weight and exhibits all the signs of someone who is continually on drugs. She drinks excessively and has done a complete 180 from who she was 2 or 3 years ago. 
 However, this post is not about her poor decisions, but rather, how to communicate that we will not be giving her any presents this year (and possibly years to come). This is also a double whammy of sorts because not only is it Christmas, it is also her 21st birthday on Christmas day. So not only would we be skipping Christmas, but her birthday as well. 
 My fiance has suspected, and with good reason, that she just sells everything she gets for drug money. We don't want to put any time or money into giving her things when she's just going to use it to get high. I thought about gift cards, but she can sell those easily. Anything physical she can sell to friends or pawn. 
 I know we don't really have to say anything, but what the heck happens when we come over for Christmas and there are no presents from us to her? We have a small Christmas gathering (just his parents, his sister, and the 2 of us), so I think it'll be obvious that we didn't bring anything for her. I have no problem calling her out, but I also would prefer to not make a huge scene. My future in-laws are really great, but haven't been as harsh to FSIL as they should have been, so I don't know how they'll handle it if she gets nasty. 
 Do we just show up with the 2 presents for his parents and say nothing? What happens if she mentions something? Do we talk to his parents beforehand and hope they understand? Give me some ideas!","FSIL is a drug addict. With as little dysfunction as possible, how do we not shell out any money for her this Christmas?",21,F,relationships
"Update summary below :P 
 Backstory : Been on Okcupid for some time, met only two guys. One offered to ""take things slow"" but we had little in common while the other I was into ended up pressuring me for sex 8 dates down the line and taking my V-card. Things went downhill after that for other reasons. Currently my profile is out of commission but I plan to activate again. Oh and I'm 19. 
 I'll state this now that I'm pretty sex positive, no problem with sexuality and I'll be adventurously so with just one caveat. I'm not interested in sex unless the guy is interested in a committed relationship. Meaning it's just me and him, going on dates, getting to know each other on a mental/emotional level to assure there's actual you know  compatibility ? By the time we make a genuine connection I'll be ripping his clothes off haha 
 {I guess they'd call it exclusive dating but if you know another name for this, tell me} 
 And just to explain my reasons for this requirement: 
 
 Not interested in sleeping around and catching an STD so monogamy ftw! 
 
 I feel a guy should be interested in me more for more than what's between my thighs. I respect and expect to be loved for my heart and brain :P as horribly cliche as that sounds.. 
 
 If a guy goes wham bam thank you mam :( that's kinda lame/don't want that. 
 
 
 BTW nothing religious is influencing me AND I pay for my half in all my dates unless the guy continues to offer. So there's no reason to say a guy is losing out on dating someone like me when there's a chance I'll end things without giving up the goods. 
 Worse case scenario? He spends time with a cool chick he met off the internet and possibly makes a friend.  I truly hope men don't think it's time wasted if they're not scoring.  I know it's a bit old fashioned but is there hope of this ever happening or should I call it quits to avoid a situation where I'm pressured for sex? My plan is to activate me profile and highlight that I'm looking for something serious and if a guy goes on pressuring for sex I'll calmly explain myself. If he bounces well... we have differences of opinion?","Am I prudish to want to delay sexy time until I get to know a guy/are in a committed relationship? What should I do with guys I really like a lot but pressure me to have sex ? 
 
 [UPDATE] Okay to summarize what I've been hearing. I should be upfront where I stand sexually in order to avoid leading someone on but I've decided to not mention it until they do or when I see my boundaries will be crossed (as to not assume negatively a guy's intentions). 
 Lots of talk of what it means to be sex positive or a prude. Many differing opinions so it boiled down to ""different strokes for different folks"". Some people were okay with any consensual sex between two adults regardless of the time span of dates, others were more keen on slowly escalating sexually with someone. No real consensus on what is ""normal"" so I should assume everyone's in a different boat and treat each case individually. 
 What I gathered is that if I meet a guy who is of the former camp, then we have a talk and if a compromise or understanding cannot arise then it's a compatibility issue so goodbye. 
 THANK YOU ALL FOR RESPONDING! Honestly, sexuality is a complicated issue and everyone is going to say something different but it helped me   a lot   to figure out what I was okay with and that no, I'm not weird for being this way and that if people get the impression that I'm a prude then that's not my problem.",19,F,OkCupid
"Throw-away because I'm overly paranoid... 
 I've been working at my current job for nearly a year (including a 3-month training program). I love what I do, but I don't work in the most professional environment known to man. Suffice it to say, there are approx 16 of us, only 2 are male and we deal in data entry and customer service, mainly. 
 Even before I was hired, she had it out for me. She tried to keep the supervisor from hiring me, and while she was training me tried to make me screw up and quit. After I was released from training she started spreading rumors about me, and trying to make people uncomfortable working with me on night shifts when there are fewer of us. 
 When we work together I am always very flustered. I stumble through everything, have trouble keeping my thoughts straight, even stutter through my sentences sometimes - this is VERY unlike me. She hovers over my desk, watches my every move, calls me out very publicly on any little mistake I may make. I KNOW that accuracy and precision are important, but she calls me out and makes me feel like I am shit at my job. She talks down to me, and to basically everyone else. She has even made statements that she wishes we didn't have to serve customers of certain races, religions, and income levels...obviously we cannot discriminate like that. 
 Most recently, a data-entry error was made that required an informal incident report be sent to our supervisor. (Basically just an email that says hey this happened, here's when, here's how we fixed it, won't happen again! Sorry!) As soon as the mistake was noticed our team set about to get it fixed. It only took maybe a minute to remedy the error. Everyone know that it started with me, but also had the decency not to call me out - except her. She stood up, called me out, threw me under the bus, told me I had to write up an incident report (duh) and ""I have to see it before you send it!"" 
 I would like to point out that she is not my Supervisor, that we have the EXACT same job title, she just has a few more years under her belt than I do. Also, a couple of months back, everyone and their mom started making complaints to the sup about all the bs that goes on in the office (it's more than just her), and her reply to all of it was basically that she didn't care and wouldn't do anything about it.  Also, this woman and my boss are besties. 
 It's not like I work with her every day, but when I do I feel like I just forget how to do my job. With my supervisor having made it obvious that she won't figure out personnel complaints, I'm not sure where to turn to. My job is really important to me... please, any advice is much MUCH appreciated!","My (23yof) co-worker (40'sF) makes me very nervous which causes me to make mistakes.

"Hi r/relationships. My family is in shambles, and I have no idea how to deal with it. 
 My parents had been married for 28 years, and they had me, 25, and my brother, 24. Our family always seemed relatively normal to me, even though my dad always drank a lot, and my parents fought a lot. 
 I left in February 2011 to go teach English in South America for a year. About midway through, my mom and I skyped, and she told me that she had finally left my dad until he decided to seriously seek rehab for his drinking and pot addictions. 
 It turned out to be more than that. She had recently reconnected with an old flame, gone to be with him for a weekend, and then decided to leave for good. 
 While I was on the other side of the world, I heard bits and pieces here and there from my devastated dad, and from my brother and his wife, but no one really had time to spend filling me in. 
 In the meantime, I was a complete wreck. I practically stopped talking to my boyfriend, who was still in the States, and sent dozens of emails begging my mom to reconsider. 
 On top of that, there was the blame I held for myself. I've since gotten mostly over that, but at the time there was the feeling that maybe if I'd never left, then my mom wouldn't have gotten distracted and started chatting with old boyfriends -- we're really close, and she had frequently complained of being bored while I was gone. Then there was my dad's mom, who said that I was the only one who could talk sense into her, and my dad himself, who frequently said the same thing. 
 I came home at Christmas. Really, not a lot had changed since I was in Chile. My mom was begging me and my brother to forgive her, my dad was being devastated, and my brother being distant by keeping himself busy and spending all his time with his wife and my dad. 
 After a month of living with my dad, I was offered a job in Seattle, three hours north of my hometown. Ideal, since I have a community of people up here, including my boyfriend who has been a saint throughout everything. 
 But things at home have gotten a lot worse. My mom is still seeing the guy she left my dad for, and my dad is rarely not drunk. He seems to be doing okay with work, more out of necessity (he's absolutely broke half the time, and is constantly asking me for money), but he's very clearly suffering. 
 I understand why my mom left, but our relationship has really suffered. I can't talk with her the way I used to without thinking of this other man. I miss her terribly, and she misses me, but it is way, way too hard for me to talk to her because she seems to be over the whole thing while I'm still hurting. 
 For example, the other day she called up, asked how I was doing, and then said she was going to get rid of all the rings my dad had given her, and I could have first pick. When I told her it was too soon for me to think about that, she got really offended and asked when I would forgive her. 
 My dad, apparently, has admitted to my mom that he knows he needs help, but told my mom that he's so afraid of failing that he won't seek it. I can't talk to him about it...we've never been that close, though I love him dearly and I know he loves me. To top it off, he has anger issues and sometimes the way he talks about the other man really, really scares me. 
 I try to make it home once a month, which is challenging since I work in politics and this is an election year. I just got an e-mail from my mom mentioning in a passing line that my dad wrecked his truck. 
 No one called to tell me. No one answered their phones when I called to see what was going on. I assume he's okay, otherwise someone would have called me, but I feel so completely disconnected -- no one ever calls me, except for my mom to tell me every now and then that she misses me. I try to call my dad, but he makes the conversations really short. 
 I don't know what to do. I've never dealt with anything like this, since I was constantly under the delusion that my family was normal and we all loved each other. 
 I would really like to see a counselor, or something like that, but since I don't have insurance, it's not an option. 
 So after all that, here are some questions. Any answers would help as none of my friends here really seem to be able to relate... 
 
 Most important is getting my dad help. How can I tell him, ask him, to get the help he knows that he needs? I can't talk to him, or even think about it around him without breaking down into tears. 
 
 How can a start to rebuild a relationship with my mom? We were so close before, but now half the time it ends with her demanding forgiveness that I don't know how to give. 
 
 What can I do to make myself more connected to my family? I can't be there as often as I like, my brother hates talking on the phone, and e-mail, and even facebook, my dad's worse than he is.

"I'll try to keep this as brief as possible. 
 I've been with my boyfriend for 4 and a half years. He's 27 and I'm 26. We've known each other since high school (so 10+ years). We started dating my senior year of undergrad. To be fully honest, I've known he's ""the one"" since 3 months into our relationship. He's an amazing man and I've never felt so loved by and felt so much love toward another person in my life. We've lived together for over 2 and a half years. We've combined our stuff, and even bought a dog together. 
 I've been ready for marriage for at least 3 years now, but I know he hasn't been. I finished my undergrad in 4 years, but it took him 7. While I was starting my career he was still finishing his undergrad and delivering pizzas. He finished, worked a shitty job for a year and then decided to get his Master's and become a teacher (like me). When we talked about marriage before he made it clear that he wanted to be done with school, have his teaching license and have his career at least started. It sucked to have to wait longer, but I respected it. 
 Well here we are. He's completed his Masters and is teaching 7th grade English. We're even teaching in the same school! We're both in a good spot in our careers and I'm still waiting... 
 We had the marriage conversation again about a month ago and it didn't go well. I got emotional and he got defensive. He says that there are still things that we need to work on in our relationship and while I agree, won't we ALWAYS have things to work on? 
 To get to the point, it is really starting to drag on me. At family gatherings his very religious family constantly asks ME when we're going to get married, etc... I'm becoming depressed about this. The depression is arising from the fear that I'm going to get strung along for several more years to come. I don't want to pressure him because I'll never be able to be fully happy if he proposes because of pressure... Yet I feel like I've really compromised on my part in waiting 3 years to hear the question. As said in the title, this feels like a no win situation. I feel like a fool. 
 I'm trying so hard to keep my chin up, but I know he's starting to think something is up (the ""something"" being me being really down). 
 A couple afterthoughts: I know he has a ring. It's his mother's (whose deceased) old ring. It's very special and priceless in my eyes (though a ring is not that important to me). 
 I also want to point out that I don't even want a wedding. My dream is a small ceremony at a courthouse with our closest family in attendance. I just want so badly to start my life with a man I feel so incredibly lucky to be with. 
 Any advice or words of wisdom?","Boyfriend of 4.5 years won't propose and it's really bringing me down.

"Alright, so I know some might say I'm too young understand love and maybe I am but I'm conflicted if I should reach out to her or to leave it alone because it's just a first love kind of feeling. Please read the majority part of it before saying anything like I'm too young to experience love. 
 So basically there was this girl that I started talking to in 8th grade and we started to talk everyday and we starting having feelings for each other. We kept talking until freshmen year of high school and we went to homecoming together. After that, we started drifting apart and I even talked to her about the situation. I told her that I still had feelings and we could try to work things out if she still had feelings and she didn't really give me straight forward answer. All she said was that she wanted to focus on her grades and not date because high school grades are important for college, which is understandable. After that, I really have no idea what happened between us. We just literally stopped talking (besides saying hi and catching up once in a while) and that was it. (This was a very shortened and brief part of the story). 
 Although we weren't officially in a relationship, I definitely felt like I was in one. It was like having someone at your side that supported everything you did, was there when you needed to vent, always made my day brighter,etc. However, when sophomore year started I started to lose confidence. It felt like after I had lost her I had no purpose in trying in school anymore. I was depressed for a period of time. I tried to hold onto myself and power through it cause I thought I would get over it. So when junior year came, I still felt the same way. But during junior year I had this super inspiring teacher who survived cancer and he inspired me to do well in school. So I did get over it a little and started to get back on track with motivation to get better grades. Although I still didn't get over her fully I saw that I could do things without her in my life. (I know it sound stupid that a girl could alter my grades and that's exactly why I think she had such a huge impact on me and why I can't get over her). 
 I still have those nights when I start thinking about what could've happened, which is normal for anyone who liked someone. But I don't just think about what could've happened. I bawl my eyes out. Basically I used to bawl my eyes out daily and now I bawl my eyes out every month about this. So I've improved as time went on but I'm still not over it. A part of me thinks that I can't seem to get over this is because it's a first love but also because of how we just abruptly stopped talking. It sounds really stupid to say this at my age but I do feel like she could be the one. I've had other small things with two other girls as I went to Sadie's with one and prom with the other but nothing seemed as genuine as the girl I'm trying to get over her. Even after things didn't work out with the other two girls I get sad but not emotional. 
 I'm only questioning myself is because even after two girls I still can't over the first one. I constantly am thinking about what could've happened. I get super emotional, it's indescribable. The only reason I'm posting this today and not 3 years ago is because I thought I would get over it. Now as a senior, I still haven't gotten over it. The reason I'm posting this is cause I had this dream last night (I know it's only a dream but I think there's some meaning to it). 
 Dream: I got a notification on my phone that it was her birthday and that day I had to go to the airport. While I was waiting for the elevator she happened to be in front of me and I told her happy birthday and we hugged for maybe a minute and we asked how she was (the basic stuff) and she slowly walked and pushed me onto the wall and I let go cause I was scared of what was gonna happen. And after that we hung out the whole day after and we canceled out flights. I know I know, sounds stupid since it was a dream but I'm only mentioning it because I think it means something. When I let go when we got to the wall in the dream, I think I let go cause I'm scared of allowing myself to catch more feelings for her again cause everything about it felt so genuine and I didn't want her to break my heart all over again, that's the only way I could describe it. 
 I'm not sure if I should reach out to her since it's senior year or let it go. I'm scared if she does have the same feelings that I'm gonna get hurt again. I felt like I was hit by a truck when we stopped talking. I'm also scared to face rejection but at the same time I don't want to live my life without knowing the answer.  I'm aware that I kinda answered my own question but I think what I'm getting at with this post is if anyone had a similar situation and how they handled it. 
 Sorry, this is a throwaway account and first time posting something like this and I do feel like it's a little messy story-wise because it's honestly an indescribable feeling that I had.

"Ohkay, So once upon a time i was a young 16 year old boy with a girlfriend. We were pretty cool, and a both a bit inexperienced in the sexual department of things. Anyways, one day I walk her home and she invites me inside. It was cool, we sat around listened to music and played Yu-Gi-Oh for fun. but after that we started making out on her bed.

"I'm 21 and I am excited to finally be with my husband after being apart for 2 years. He is in the Air Force, stationed in the UK. I am in the Marines, stationed stateside on the east coast. 
  We've been married 1.5 years and we've been separated for over 2, with the exception of taking leave to see each other, no longer than two weeks at a time, usually 6-8 months apart.  We have never lived together as a married couple. 

  His 2 years on station in the UK are finally up!  Thankfully he got stationed near me so we can finally live together!  It's hard to believe its finally happening!  
 
 Only 16 days before he's here for good!!!

"Little background!
My dog used to be fairly socialized, but when he was 2, we moved up to Maine with my family. I decided to move down to Georgia on my own, and for 2 years I spent working and finding my own place to keep my dog. He's now almost 5, and while he was in Maine, he was kept only socialized with my parents two dachshunds. 
 From this, I've found him now fairly picky over the dogs he likes. He's terrified of almost anything. Plastic bags, loud noises, and specially big dogs. He stands completely still, then snaps at them, as in he's scared. 
 When we go on walks through my neighborhood, if there's a dog about his size or smaller, he'll run up, remain super still, then he'll play bow, or chase them around and run with them. I don't think he's ever snapped at a smaller dog, except one that was fairly old and seemed uneasy and scared of my dog, already. But I don't think he snapped, he just didn't seem comfortable. 
 I take him to the dog park sometimes, and in the small dog pen, he does fine! He runs around, and plays, and has a good time. But when a ""bigger"" dog comes in, he doesn't like it. The last time we went to the park, a BABY pitbull came in. He was about the same size as my dog (25 lbs, he's a JRT/Whippet mix), maybe a tiny bit bigger. At first he was OK, but then he kind of defensively snapped at the Pit. Luckily, he's a baby and didn't really care or know any better, so they moved along. I kept an eye on him, and when he did it again, I removed him from the park. 
 My friend owns a small maltese like dog, it isn't a maltese, but the breed is eluding me at this moment. But she's smaller than my dog, and older. They've met twice. The first time they met, I was not here. My friend took my dog to her house and they met. Side note, my dog HATES cars. When she got home, she first brought him in her house, and she said he snapped at her dog. Then she took them outside, same thing. So she brought him back to my house. Second time they met was at a dog park, totally fine. We then went out to eat together, on a patio, and they were ok, unless there was food, then my dog got defensive. Basically her dog doesn't give a shit. 
 I think the first meeting was a combination of me not being there, and the car ride, and the unusual place. Her dog is very passive, and when my dog was living with my parents dogs, he was the submissive one. We are wondering the BEST way to get them used to each other, or to meet, and transition into living together.","dogs met twice, my dog snapped one time after meeting friends dog without me there and after a car ride (he hates cars), then once with food in the way, fine together at dog park.

"Howdy, 30M here and I've had my world turned upside down in many ways recently and would appreciate perspectives over how I'm currently managing my relationships... 
 I'm in the process of getting divorced after my wife left me at the beginning of the year. I still see us together in my heart, and restoring our family to what it was, living back in our family home with our children. I've been told this really won't happen though. She spent 18 months deciding to stay or go, and so clearly didn't take it lightly... The pull to be living with my kids 7 days a week is MASSIVE, and I do still love my wife I think. My wishes don't matter in the slightest though, if she doesn't want to get back together. 
 This is background to the fact that I've been seeing another woman for the last few months in what is probably a clumsy, ill thought through attempt to move on. I am utterly terrified of being alone, I know that much. But either way, this woman is lovely, and in a very similar situation to me in many ways, more like me over all than my wife, and on paper we're a great match. 
 So I'm in this situation where I expect I would go back to my wife and kids without too much back and forth if we both felt we could sort things out, but at the same time trying to honestly progress this new relationship given that I'm told the chance of what I would rather have being utterly impossible forever. 
 So if it's impossible, it's surely a nonsense to let that stop me trying to move on? I have made it very clear to my wife that whatever I do I am open to fixing our family (I'm very nerdy and partially Aspergic so think in a pretty clunky / mechanical way at times). It was my wife's birthday last week, and I still gave her a (simple) present and card, with ""love from"" in it. I won't beg her, that seems very wrong, but I want her to know the cold hard facts about where I stand. 
 I don't want to mess my girlfriend around, she's lovely, and I think in many / most respects I'm genuinely looking forward to / expecting a long term future with her (or at least, managing our relationship based on us and nothing else - it's not perfect and maybe something will make us go our separate ways as happens to most relationships). 
 I'm not holding onto her until my wife changes her mind. She won't change her mind, I know that, but I still admit I live in hope. I don't  think  I'm being selfish or anything here, but often I admit it feels pretty uncomfortable. The thought of splitting up with my girlfriend to just stay home all week long feeling sad and lonely in case my wife what... takes pity on me? Seems just illogical and pointless to me. I'm pretty sure my therapist would say I'm not being a bad person, and I'm just someone trying to live my life as best as I can manage. I've low self esteem and have spent my life presuming I'm the one at fault, and any feelings of guilt or such are my own doing, and I'm trying to shake this negativity and hold my head up high, as hard as it is.","with a new woman pending divorce, but would rather be with my 99.99% unobtainable ex wife.

"I'm a guy who just turned 30. Starting a couple years ago I decided to get my shit together. I went back to school and am just about finished with the degree I abandoned years ago. I'm on an internship that pays more than the full time jobs I had throughout my twenties and I'm expecting it to develop into a full time job. I started lifting and my body is better than I ever thought possible. I like the way I dress, I like the way I look, and the way my career is heading and I feel like I'm turning into the person I always wished I could be. 
 It just feels like it's all too late for any of it to matter when it comes to the things that are really important. The biggest problem is I'm realizing that I don't have connections with other people. My family feel like strangers and I don't have much contact with them. I've never had any friends and, the older I get the more I feel like I'm never going to have them. People my age seem to have formed their social groups and, for the most part, seem to have less and less interest in meeting new people as they start families and get more devoted to their careers. 
 I never learned how friendships worked when I was younger so by high school I was basically completely socially isolated. I never figured out how to make friends in my first attempt at college and, while I talk to people in class now and people tend to treat me like ""one of them,"" I feel like I'm a bit too old to hang out with most of them and don't really see any potential for friendships there. 
 I've tried dating, which seems to suck even for well-adjusted gay guys my age. I don't even really want a boyfriend right now (since I can't imagine actually having a relationship) but I don't want to end up old and alone so it feels like something I need to do. I can get laid easily if I want, especially now that I have a better body, but it's so completely unsatisfying that I don't do it very often. 
 It's just really hard to feel like any progress I make is worth it when at the end of the day I'm still completely isolated. I don't even really feel human or like I have any real identity. No place feels like ""home,"" there's nothing to look forward to in weekends and holidays, I have no real belief system or code to live by... everything is just working or trying to distract myself until I can be working again. I'm starting to feel really exhausted and it feels like the weight of all my wasted years is starting to wear down on me. 
 Anyone have any suggestions? I've been trying to force myself to go to meetups and things like that without much success. Right now I mostly just want ways to cope with the isolation for a while since I know it might be a good while before I have any serious connections with others.",Been getting better than I ever thought possible but it doesn't seem worth it because of social isolation,30,M,DecidingToBeBetter
"Background:  In college I became bulimic to the point where I was binging and purging up to 4 times a day, everyday.  I dropped out of college for a semester to get psych help, see a therapist, psychiatrist, group therapy for eating disorders, the works.  It helped and gave me tools to break my habit. 
 Unfortunately eating disorders can be really hard to stay away from forever and in my 20's and 30's I've had small relapses, always sending me back to therapy for a little while until I got back into control. 
 Now I'm finally in a happy, healthy place mentally and I wanted to address my weight, which had steadily increased up to 257lbs.  I started tracking my food intake, doing cardio, eating 1300-1500 calories a day without restricting the types of food I can eat.  Mostly I'm doing good, slowly but steadily losing 17 lbs over the past 3 months. 
 However, there are times when limiting myself makes me binge and then I purge so I won't gain weight.  It's happened 5-6 times since I started eating less calories.  I get hungry, then I want to eat everything and suddenly I'm back in the cycle. 
 But these past days are different. I've started to think about what I really want for my health.  Do I want to stress and shame that I feel after a binge?  Do I want to feel light headed, sick and unhealthy for the rest of the day?  Do I want to have to hide my binge and lie so no one knows what's up?  No, I don't. 
 The thing about my eating disorder is that it is rarely an isolated incident.  Once turns into a second time, then it snowballs and before you know it I am binging and purging several times a week. 
 So I armed myself.  I've gone back to my ED literature and searched out coping methods on the internet. [This article had some good advice.](  I've also heard the ""play it forward"" concept where you think about what was going to happen after the binge, how were you going to feel, were you going to regret it. 
 And so today I was starving and dying for a binge.  I wanted to feel stuffed and satisfied on something carb-y so I got into the car and headed to Taco Bell.  On the way there I thought to myself, do you really want to do this?  Are you sure you aren't just hungry?  Can you eat something healthy and wait until your hunger passes to make this decision?  How proud of yourself would you feel if you didn't binge?  I turned the car around and came home.  I ate something filling, but healthy and I got busy doing something else. 
 Everyday is a challenge, but like I've learned with my healthier weight loss, every single choice you make counts.  And when I replace an unhealthy choice with a healthy one, I am working to make healthy choices my habit, my normal.  If I screw up, I think about why I made those choices and process it, not just push the mistake to the back of my mind.  Then I just start right back making healthy choices again.",Today I turned the car around on the way to a binge by using coping techniques and I'm pretty damn proud of that.,30,F,fuckeatingdisorders
"So, I (16M) have been talking recently with a friend (16F).  This friend in particular is really sexually open.

"Good afternoon all. I'm reaching a point in my life where decisions on marriage are soon to be made and I'm having second thoughts. 
 My SO and I are both turning 30 over the next 12 months. We've been together for 6 years, living together for 3. Over the past 3 years we both have settled into careers in our goal industries, so we're both quite happy on the work-front. We're quite happy on the relationship-front too, and starting to think about marriage now that we're financially stable and a little older. 
 There's just one issue (and I do mean just one issue, because in all other ways our relationship is wonderful): he works very long hours. This will not go away. This is the career and industry he has chosen, and it is known for its long hours. I'm not sure if I want to sign up for a life of having a part-time relationship. It very much feels like a part-time relationship right now. 
 I do have many hobbies and organizations that I am a part of. I keep myself busy with things that I am generally interested in and enjoy doing. But still, 5 nights out of the week I come home to an empty home and don't see my SO until he gets home around 9:00pm. We both go to bed around 11:00pm, and honestly I do better going to bed at 10:00pm but stay up later to spend time with him. I don't think this is the life I want. I want to come home and see my SO and cook dinner together and just live our lives together. We get this on weekends and on a weeknight every once in a while, but now thinking about life-long commitments I'm just not sure that is enough. 
 However, what is the alternative of a part-time relationship with him? No relationship with him at all. Seeing him never as opposed to not enough. That is the opposite of what I want! So breaking up seems like the worst possible outcome. Being in a part-time relationship with him is better than not being with him at all. 
 But then again, I hate coming home to an empty house. I don't want a marriage like that. I'm in a circular thought-process prison and don't know what to do.","Relationship with SO is wonderful in all ways except that he works long hours and I only see him for an hour or two before bed and on weekends - we don't get to have dinner together or spend time together on weeknights.

"So my best friend, we'll call her Mandy [20F] and I[20F] have been friends for 16 years.

 >  Do you think a person can be successful when his mind is somewhere else? 
 Yes. But also, a person can choose what to look at and choose to be happy or unhappy with any particular situation. Stupid example, but imagine someone eating a food they find disgusting. They can think, god, ewww, this is horrible. Or they can think, thank god I have nourishment for the day. It's a silly example but it's about perspective. You choose your perspective. It is a bit easier when you are older and have lived through hard times..

 You haven't experienced true hardship so you are in an existential bubble. Tread very carefully. There are COUNTLESS threads on here from guys who are about 25 and they fucking up their lives bad.. leaving good girls, doing stupid shit to try to chase the ever elusive happiness.. trying to catch back up with youth.. all kinds of existential nonsense. But then on the same page you see threads from guys who are 30 and they are complaining about how they fucked up this or that years ago and can't get back on track... it's a vicious, stupid circle, I hate seeing those threads because people make themselves their worst enemy. 
 Don't make yourself your worst enemy by trying to chase the good social years of the past, that's behind you. Yes, by all means, you can have a life now, with some extra work, but if you let yourself think too much you will find yourself falling for the old grass is greener trap. 
 Now lets talk about happiness. Those zeros in the bank ARE happiness. In the next few years it's going to be time to think about having a kid. You want to be prepared. You'll need money to let your wife stay home... men who can't provide and have to make a sad mother go off and leave her baby aren't happy!! When your kid has to go to some piece of shit day care and mix with disgusting other snotty children you'll be kicking yourself in the ass for not letting those zeros stack up. Happiness is being able to provide for your family. You can't imagine it now, but it's more fulfilling than anything you've done to date. 
 5 years goes by.. does your kid have to go to some shit school or can he go to private school... this never ends just so you know. School, travel, clothing, medical expenses, food, care, housing, transportation.. you will want your kid to have access to everything he will need. If you can't provide it, your misery will be so great that what you are feeling now is orgasmic in comparison. 
 > What if, I'm here for the next five to ten years, and suddenly realize that I've never been happy here in the first place, and I've just been autonomously been working at this job because I felt obligated to, and suddenly I'm almost 30? 
 Reality is, where ever you are, this will be your situation, so your best bet is to make the most money you can while helping your family. I'm dead serious about your friends becoming very unavailable very soon anyway. This is the age where they get into a career, find a woman, plan a wedding, and pop out some kids. Your transitioning into a phase where you'll meet your friends every 6 months and not every weekend. It's slow at first, every weekend, then every other weekend, then once a month, then once every two months.. and before you know it you see your friends very seldom. 
 So if you go back home, you might squeeze a year or two of fun times out. But then it will be time to have a family.. then guess what? Yep, what we talked about before, god forbid you make a heavily pregnant woman work just because you were in an existential crisis over party times and left this sure thing...

We were poking around the garage and somehow I get it into my head that it would be fun to tie some fishing line to a frozen bagel and dangle it over the cart path, hitting the windshields of golf carts as they drove by. 
 So we strung the bagel up over a tree branch and ran the fishing line to a concealed location, then lay in wait for our first victims.

 The Atheist: As Trustworthy as a Rapist.
    In America, there seems to a disturbingly large bias against atheists. In a poll conducted last year by the University of British Columbia and the University of Oregon, a large percentage of theists (believers) would trust an atheist as much as a rapist. These people are merely misinformed about what atheism really is, and I will gladly take the opportunity to clarify. Given that this is the United States, I will assume that these are mostly Christians, and subsequent points will be addressed as such. 
 What is an atheist?
    The atheist is simply someone who does not believe in any sort of higher power. Many prominent atheists such as evolutionary biologist and one of the “Four Horsemen of New Atheism”, Richard Dawkins claim that Christians are atheistic with respect to Hinduism and other non-Abrahamic religions. To extrapolate, this would mean that anyone who does not believe in a certain god is atheistic toward that religion. This definition is way too vague, as it allows everyone in the world to be an atheist, which in the case of this essay would be inaccurate. True atheists have a problem with the blind faith required by most religions. We are very logical and for the most part think like scientists and logicians. 
 Why don’t atheists believe?
    When approaching this question, there are two reasons. The first is that the atheist never had any form of religious education. The second, and in this day age far more common, is the atheist who has rejected his previous beliefs. This is either due to a logical or philosophical disagreement with religion, or both. Hitchens' Razor states, “That which can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence”. A razor is a logic tool used for dismissing certain explanations for a given outcome. Christopher Hitchens created his razor in his book God is not Great to discredit religion. To an atheist, because the concept of a deity cannot be conclusively proven, it must be dismissed. Atheists also disapprove of the content of the Bible. We are at odds with certain Bible verses involving sexism and other forms of intolerance, since Christ preached the acceptance of others. While the Bible does contain valuable lessons, certain things cannot be overlooked. Stoning is now considered a barbaric practice and is only used in undeveloped countries. Women are considered equal to men (1 Tim 2:11-15), and homosexuality is more tolerated than it once was (Leviticus 20:13). I, personally, look at religious scripture as a book of fables, akin to The Odyssey and Aesop's Fables. The Bible and the other two books all accomplish the same purpose. They tell a series of stories with lessons to be learned from them, but in a fictional and sometimes supernatural context. While I share the view with most atheists that the Bible has valuable lessons to be learned from it, in reality it is outdated and does not accurately apply to modern society. Many of the lessons of the Bible can be taught in other ways and the concepts of heaven, hell and an omnipotent being are simply ways of enforcing these lessons and therefore redundant to an atheist. We see God as the equivalent of Santa Claus; at the end of the year, Santa rewards children by bringing them gifts, and at the end of life, God rewards people with admittance to heaven. And finally, in a bit of an arrogant way, we just do not like to be told what to do or what to believe in. 
 Where do atheists get their morals?
    This is one of the simplest and yet most complex questions to answer. The short answer is easy: debate. In reality, it is much more complex. Theists typically get their morals from God and the Bible. Therefore, it is difficult for them to understand the concept of atheist morality. We reject the idea of absolute morality. Everything has been discussed, thought about, and argued. To fuel these arguments, we often consult various texts to decide on morals, such as the works of Friedrich Nietzsche, Aristotle, Leo Tolstoy, and Isaac Asimov. We also look to prominent figures in history and literary characters, such as Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr, Pierre Bezukhov, Jesus Christ, and Candide. The best way to describe the process of this moral transformation is to tell the story of my own. In War and Peace, Tolstoy emphasizes pacifism, as did Gandhi, King, and Christ. The messages of these men have meant the most to me, such as forgiving one’s enemies. They truly lived by their teachings and embodied the change they wanted to see in the world. This is not to say that I did not form part of my philosophy by drawing my own conclusions. I believe that one should only resort to violence as a last resort. Until then, the conflict should be resolved through diplomatic means. I chose this moral and political philosophy of pragmatic pacifism because it has made the most sense to me. Although each atheist may follow a different philosophy, we all arrive at it in relatively the same way. 
 Why is there such animosity towards atheists?
    At first it can be difficult to understand why intelligent and peaceful people would be the targets of enmity but the logic is rather simple. Christians see God as the embodiment of all that is good. To the everyday Christian, atheism poses no problem, but to the Evangelical, any rejection of God is seen as evil. This leads to the incorrect assumption that atheists are Satan-worshippers. Satanism requires a belief in Satan as a deity, which we would obviously reject. Also, many conservative religious organizations see a rejection of God as a threat to their authority. Again, these are only conservative, close-minded organizations, not all. Their authority is based on the blind faith of their followers, so as soon as that faith is questioned, the authority collapses. It would be difficult to find a better example than the Catholic Church's reaction to the ideas of Galileo Galilee when he claimed that Earth was not at the center of the universe. The church suppressed his works and other Copernican astronomers, which were proven through simple observation through a telescope. He eventually recanted his statements under threat of torture and death. Whether or not Galileo was really an atheist is not known; if he had come out as one, he would certainly have been killed. This oppressive way of thinking continued into the twentieth century, with Pope Pius XII proclaiming that “One Galileo in two thousand years is enough.” Any animosity towards atheists is the result of either a tragic misunderstanding of atheism or an organization's desire to keep its followers under its thumb. 
 What do atheists live for?
    This truly depends on the atheist in question, but most atheists like to identify with some form of existential humanism. This is because we do not like the idea of living for something that has not been empirically proven to exist. Instead, we find meaning in the experiences of life and in humanity. We reject the idea of living for another life and world that we have not seen, felt, or heard. We are not concerned with this second life at all; rather, we think about today and this life. The idea of repenting all sins and then gaining admission to a utopia is strange to us. While this is a comforting idea, it is inherently selfish. This means that Christians should good things not for the sake of the deed, but for the increased chance of admission to heaven. Rather than hope for one already made, we try to make this world a utopia. 
 Aren’t all atheists fierce anti-theists like the Four Horsemen?
    Short answer, no. The Four Horsemen are Christopher Hitchens, Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, and Daniel C. Dennet. These are the leaders of the “New Atheism” movement who think that religion should be attacked and stamped out. This is an extreme view and is not consistent with the tolerance of religion that most atheists support and embody. We like to live by blending in with others, not by preaching our atheism as though we were the counterparts of the Westboro Baptist Church. 
 (Wrapping things up)
    We are by nature peaceful people who do not wish harm on any other person. The notion that we should be equal on the moral scale with rapists is totally irrational and ignorant of facts. Less than one percent of America's prison population identifies as atheist, while ninety-three percent of all scientists are either atheist or agnostic. We honestly do not care what anyone believes. This is applied in two ways: We will ignore any attempts at “conversion” to a given faith, and we will not go out trying to “un-convert” theists.","Dispelling modern myths about atheism.

"People involved are my ex (m26) dated 2 years on and off, me (f24), and friend Jen (f24) of 5 years. 
 Back in 2010 while still dating my ex-boyfriend we took a cruise vacation with a group of friends (we were on and off for 2 years at the time); it was March when my friend Jen booked the cruise and put everyone's tab on her credit card, everyone paid her back before our sailing date in May, except for my ex. I knew it wasn't going to be cheap going on a cruise in the summer so I asked him if he was able to come with us, which he agreed to. He had been graduated from college for a year by that time, but with no job. I assumed he had financial help from his parents or some money saved up, so I didn't think much of it, we are all adults, I didn’t question his finance, we went on the cruise. In June 2010, a month after the vacation, my friend Jen told me my ex still hasn't paid her back, see, my ex never bothered to find a job after graduating college, he was living with his parents, sleeping till the afternoon and on the computer all day, not looking for any form of income. I even paid for all our expenses on the cruise to ease his burden. Anyway, I asked him to get at least a part-time job so he can pay Jen back bit by bit over a few months… it never happened, he thinks if he just wait it out Jen will eventually forget about this, and he’ll never have to pay her back. Jen asked him for money a few times over the year, but with no luck. 
 I broke up with him in 2011 for reasons mainly involving his irresponsibleness and his unmotivated ass; we haven’t spoke since then and have both moved on. Jen called and texted my ex, but he never responded. Fast forward to now, it’s been 2 years since the cruise, Jen is losing her patience (she’s got some patience), she is going to ask my ex one more time, if he still doesn’t respond, Jen will take legal action. From what I know from mutual Facebook friends, my ex is STILL without a proper job and is unlikely to come up with $1000, should I warn him what might be upon him? He does do a gig where he dresses up as a super hero for kid’s birthday parties, so I guess he has  some  money. 
 My question is, should I even get involved with this mess? Or just let Jen deal with my ex? I'd like to warn him because I pity him, and I don’t really want to end up seeing him in court under these circumstances.","Ex of 2.5 years owes my friend of 5 years a grand for a cruise we took two years ago.

"I'll try to keep mine compact, as mine may be a bit lengthier and a bit rockier, my good sir. 
 2006: Got addicted to watching lots of YouTube videos to an unhealthy level. 
 July 25, 2006: After watching a bunch of Kingdom Hearts Random videos, I thought they were the funniest things since the last thing that was insanely funny. I decided to make my own with Windows Movie Maker. Video holds 6.3K views and is still my most watched video. 
 October 2007 - June 2008: Released one more Kingdom Hearts random video, then put up random uploads a few months apart at a time. Didn't really know much about subscriber bases or things like that. June 2008 marks the point when I became astounded by Gears of War and bought my Dazzle DVC 100 capture card. 
 Nov 2008 - After months of recording gameplay footage, I finally released my first Gears of War sniper/shotgun montage. Loads of effort went into it, networked with other Gears of War players, many of them were making montages and YouTube channels too. A week after this montage came out, Gears of War 2 came out. Did not live up to the community's hype, and so I didn't make a montage for it. Kept playing Gears 1 with a few montage friends, while also hanging out with a buddy I met who loved to not play seriously. 
 Nov. 2008 - Dec. 2009: Put up a couple of non-serious videos about Gears 2 and just some miscellaneous stuff. Most of them were quick videos I came up with in under an hour. Not a whole lot of effort put into them. But then I released a Gears of War Dueltage with a friend of mine. This took months of recording and a couple of days of hardcore editing. By this point, I had purchased a Happauge HD PVR (of which I'm trying to sell now, by the way...) This was the end of my Gears of War videos, for the most part. 
 Sep. 2010 - Jan 2011: Uncharted 2 was a blast to play, and since Christmas of 2009, I had been playing it boat loads. It only took about a year to think of making a video or something on it. And so I made a few random videos, as well as some co-op videos with that buddy who likes to not take things seriously. The videos went well, except I had no means of recording our voice. Long play! I also made a few weird videos around this time, some stupid stuff, but was mainly what me and my buddy would make just to get a laugh that we actually made it and publicized it. 
 Jan. 2013 - May 2013: To make it clear, I barely pushed out any videos. It's been about 40 videos in about 6 years, and they were low-quality. YouTube wasn't a priority, whereas getting a career in game design was. 2010 was when I first started college. During this period, my buddy would have me make these sort of blindfold videos where he would take full creative control, and I would essentially visualize his thoughts. We ended up making these stupid, yet (I think they are) brilliant videos I've labeled as the Saga of Emotion and Tears. The latest video was put up last month. 
 May 2013 - February 14, 2014:  I discovered r/letsplay. I found that a lot of you guys were making careers off of being an online gaming entertainer. I then started looking through this sub's wiki and seeing how money can potentially add up if you get a good following and such. Reflecting on how much I enjoyed making KH videos, Gears videos, and Uncharted videos, and also looking at companies like THQ shutting down and massive layoffs everywhere, I decided this may be a better approach. Not only that, it was a wake-up call. That's when I discovered that I REALLY wanted to do this for a living, to the point where I want to defy any odds and make this my dream job. And so I got together with a friend of mine, Jake, and over the summer we created Fairweather Games. We had loads of ideas that were fairly unique, and when thinking about them, I got really excited. However, from about October 2013 to February 14th, 2014, I noticed that I was far more ambitious and looked for perfection over my partner. From that, I was constantly infuriated by his work, and how it lacked professional quality. Not only that, they were never on time, required multiple uploads to fix errors, and he was unenthusiastic during commentating, despite having a lot of energy and a lot to say when I came to him to be my partner in this. But Friday, after he failed to upload a Serious Sam episode for Thursday, and it was up Friday, and not to mention the audio was unbalanced, camera movements were sloppy, etc., bad video. I told him about what was wrong with it, and he began to get angry with me. After that, I didn't respond much, but I decided that it was pretty much the end. While I ask myself if I'm concluding this too soon, every time I think of getting back to work on Goldeneye videos and things like that, I just think of how I wanted the videos to play out, but I had to lower myself down to keep a more consistent level with our content and how I knew we would probably never record together again. This was also more realized when we played Disco Dodgeball and he said that he, ""hates every game we play."" He's a very pessimistic and glass half-empty person, and I am the opposite. And so...it ended just last week.

"I've been married for 1 1/2 yeas. I'm 29, my husband is 32. Apparently, one of my husband's cousins is having a baby shower this weekend in another city and my mother-in-law wants me to ride with her. I never got an invitation, but I inadvertently saw an email the cousin sent to my MIL asking for my address to send an invitation for the baby shower. I'm thinking she may have not given my address to her and instead told her that she would tell me about it. Not sure why she would do this, but that's what it seems may have happened. 
 The problem: the thought of being trapped in a car with her for four hours (two hours there, two hours back) by myself makes me want to shoot myself. She likes to pick at everyone all the time and will ask questions just so she can  ask you why you are doing what you are doing, tell you that you are wrong, and then tell you what you should do instead. I imagine the trip will be filled with four hours of belittling me, acting like everything I do is stupid and getting all up in my business. 
 She actually is a good person and does lots of awesome things, but I always have to make sure there is someone else around as a distraction so she doesn't get fixated on interrogating me. She does this to everyone in her immediate family, not just me. I got the distraction idea from my sister-in-law. There isn't anyone else who can ride with us. My husband has to be in town that day and all the other female relatives are coming from other cities. My husband told me he wishes I would go, but he understands why I don't want to and promised to get me out of it. I feel bad about not going and would like to be able to go to the shower, but thinking about being stuck with my MIL for that long is giving me an anxiety attack. Should I just take a Xanax and suck it up?","I'm terrified of being stuck alone with my nagging mother-in-law, but don't want the rest of the family to think I don't like them.

"I apologize for any mistake, English isn't my first language. 
 I swallowed the pill not too far ago, and I wish so much I had done it sooner. I've been having a typical student sex life since I was 17. I have a count of 5 to 8 different partners depending on your definition of sexual intercourse and I regret almost all of them in one way or another. 
 The man who took my virginity was a very dear friend of mine. I was hoping he wanted to make me his girlfriend but he didn't. We saw each other 5 times, before I realized the sex wasn't so good and I wasn't attracted to him that much. I just wanted to lose my virginity like all the other girls did in my european college. 
 My second relation was oral and digital sex with a friend from class who didn't want to commit either. My first ONS. 
 Then I met a nice guy who wanted to commit and with whom I slept once before realizing we weren't right for each other. Never spoke with him after that. A ONS if you want. 
 Cue the stupidest of all my experimentations. I slept with a girl friend of mine. Why ? Because I was young and wanted to see what it was like. I wasn't even attracted that much, but she cared about me and I kinda cared about her. I craved the affection so bad. We slept once, I realized it was awful and took to my heels. Our friendship has never been the same after this. 
 Another ONS with a guy met while running. Again, awful. Hoped he would text me after the deed but he didn't. God I was stupid. 
 My sixth sexual interaction was with another close friend of mine, a handjob while he was sleeping at my place. He still texts me from time to time that he ""loves me"". But he was in an open relationship already, and he went in another country for his studies. I did it because I wanted to relieve him, once again I wasn't feeling that much attraction. 
 Seventh was a guy who took me on dates and kissed me like he meant it. We slept twice before he attempted to explain that he still felt heartbroken about his ex and wasn't ready for commitment if that was ok with me. I told him it was not, and we've remained simple friends. 
 After all this I began to feel that something was deeply wrong with my behavior. Sleeping around did nothing for my well-being. Felt lied to by our culture. I have always been very affectionate, born and raised in a family with lots of love, all these years I have only craved to find someone that I could cherish and care for. I am 21 but I feel so ready to give birth, to bestow the love that my own mother bestowed on her 4 children. I want a family, I want to make a worthy man happy. 
I stopped trying to vagina men into relationships with me, and spent a whole lonely year to myself. 
 Then I met the man I am seeing today. From the start, he swept me off my feet. Charming, intelligent, a decade older, hard-working man who wasn't very handsome (I'd say at best a 5/10) but just got it, you know. Something in him deeply touched me. I thought and felt in my chest that he could be my captain. Something lit up in my sky when I met him. And then I screwed up again, as if I had learnt nothing. I was terrified of losing him if I said no. So we slept, while he made clear he wasn't looking to settle down with me. 
 I have been his plate for 8 months now. In all this time he hasn't met anybody else. We've been getting increasingly tender with each other. I sleep in his arms, he kisses me in the nape of my neck, he whispers that ""everything about me is wonderful"". But I won't take it anymore. It will hurt but I will stop see him. I'm getting older and I can't spend my youth being his mistress. 
 RedPill did that for me. Better be alone and look for the man who will deem you valuable enough to raise his children. But I'm so afraid of ending up alone. Not meeting anybody. I want at least 4 children, the biological clock is ticking. I want a redpill man but I'm hypocrite seeing my nonredpill past. The first thing about redpill is that you cannot redeem your past - it doesn't matter what you promise to yourself, the discourse you elaborate, your count speaks for itself. The proof is, even when I thought I had changed my ways, I fell in the trap for the last guy, again, giving up sex in hopes it would open his heart. 
 How will I tell my future husband about my past when he asks ? I will not lie, that's a given.

"Before you read: This is in regards to /r/nofap correlating with /r/loseit so if you are not interested in it that's cool, this is just my thoughts on it. 
 I'm 25/m 5'7 and I just started my Journey 23 days ago. I was at 246.8 lbs (112.2 kg) and I am now down to 229.0 (104.1 kg). 
 I got out of the United States Marine Corps in January of 2011 and weighed around 185ish. By July or August of 2011 I was probably about 250 or 255. I didn't weigh myself because I was embarrassed. This caused me to gain an enormous amount of stretch marks because it was such a short time frame. 190 was the heaviest I had ever been and I had never had stretch marks. I now have stretch marks all over my shoulders and under my arms by my armpits. I have a lot of stretch marks on my sides and some on the front of my stomach. I have a lot of stretch marks on the inside of my thighs and some on the backside of my knees. I had such a sedentiary lifestyle that I never noticed the marks until I was well over 240. I was ashamed of how fat I was getting and after a shower I just quickly got out so I wouldn't look at myself. One day my sister said something to me about my stretch marks(Whats that migidarra?) And I saw it and was like...what the fuck. Maybe I saw it before but it really hit home. I stopped eating like a madman at this point but I didn't start exercising or dieting. Fast forward to April 27 or so of this year and I came upon this subreddit. I was feeling motivated and started that day. Next day I binged ate until I was depressed again. April 28 I find another subreddit which has changed my life and I recommend anyone who feels down a lot to check it out. This subreddit was /r/nofap. It was intriguing about all these people saying their accomplishments and failures and I found the link on the sidebar about YBOP(Your Brain On Porn). I watched it until the wee hours in the morning even though its only slightly over an hour long. I decided fuck it I'll do both right? So I did. Fapping releases a lot of dopamine into the brain and numbs the receptors and the same can be said about over eating bad food. So I cut them both out and I feel like an entirely different person. I've been talking to a girl to help me with this and she is extremely supportive. I've gone 23 days without fapping and 23 days of dieting(maybe 24 i don't remember). During this time my father got a raise from his job and normal I would have given him a half smile and said that's good and left it at that. When I found out about it I was happy for him. Like truly happy and not just half ass faking it. The same goes for my sister when she got her raise and for myself when I got my first job in a year and a half. I may only be working at a gas station, but I tell you now that I am happier today than I've ever been in my entire life. I can feel again and its amazing. Anytime someone says something about my weight or I tell them about how much I've lost I feel like jumping up for joy. I've always been a numb person and now I am not. I never new the joys of life until these past 3 weeks.

 From my experience, the best thing that you can do is laugh at it, see it for what it is (lame jokes that change nothing), and stop feeling sorry for yourself. I know it sounds like victim blaming, but as someone who was in the same place you are coupled with being way younger (try being a senior at 14), I can tell you it is the best way to handle it.

"My aunt was an investment banker at Morgan Stanley on 9/11. In San Francisco, I watched on TV as the second plane hit her tower. I called my uncle, who had retired and was home in their Manhattan apartment. He said he had not heard from her. He was just waiting by the phone. Calls to her cell phone went directly to voice mail. I called my sister, who said, “I know she made it out. I just feel it.” Then the buildings collapsed. I went into shock. My partner put a blanket over my shoulders, because I was shivering so badly. Forty-five minutes later, my uncle called and calmly said, “She just walked through the door. She's barefoot, covered in dust. But she is okay.” 
 My aunt rarely talks about what happened on 9/11. Over the years, I’ve been able to coax little bits from her here and there, and I’ve pieced together the following: When the first plane hit the other tower, my aunt could feel the heat from the blast as her office was at roughly the same height or higher. She and a coworker, who both worked at the WTC during the basement bombing years earlier, fled to the stairwell, leaving behind their purses and cell phones. They had reached the 40th floor when the second plane hit their building. It felt like the building swayed five feet. She accepted she might die then. She remained calm. Everyone remained calm as they descended to the right of the stairwell. Eventually, firefighters were running up the left side of the stairs. My aunt was in her early 60s then. She has a bad knee. At the 20th floor, a young man behind her, probably one of the athletic types who tend to enter the world of finance after college, offered to carry her down the rest of the way. She took off her high heels, and he carried her on his back. She does not recall his name. As she left the building, she looked straight ahead, never looking to the left or right, never looking up, as bodies fell around her. A woman in front of her was crushed by falling debris. My aunt was a few blocks away when the building that housed her office collapsed. A cloud of dust enveloped her. Still, she managed to walk twenty-some blocks to her apartment barefoot. 
 She worked a few more years at a couple of other financial institutions, never higher than the third floor, before retiring without fanfare. She and my uncle lead a quiet and comfortable retirement. They rarely venture farther than a few blocks from their apartment, because everything they need is within that small radius. They go to their modest house in the Hamptons on the weekends, where they drink their coffee in the mornings and watch the deer wander onto their property. They laugh at each other’s silly jokes in the way that only good friends can laugh. They have ridiculous nicknames for each other that make me cringe a little, like Cheeky and Darling Boy. But I shudder to imagine what my uncle’s life, what our lives, would have been like had she died in the towers. 
 My aunt never joined a survivors support group. She never sought the help of a therapist. She never spoke to the press. She never says she’s a survivor. She never seeks out anyone’s sympathy. If she suffers any ill effects, it is not evident. I like to think that if she does so privately, my uncle is by her side, holding her hand and calling her Cheeky. 
 Alicia Esteve Head must suffer from Müchausen syndrome, so it isn’t right to call her a fat bitch or a greedy pig, though it certainly is tempting. She will never have what my aunt has, and that is punishment enough.","My aunt survived 9/11, and she’s better off than Alicia Esteve Head.",60,F,videos
"Being Asian does have some advantages.  For example, I'm 6'1"" and borrowed my 5'10"" friend's ID to successfully get into bars. 
 One night, we were walking home drunk and saw the ""30 cents wings Thursday night!"" sign.  Since we both needed some munchies, we tried to get in.  The bouncer saw my friend's ID and laughed at me while saying, ""Haha nice try, but there is no way this is yours.""  My friend was already in there ordering delicious wings and I couldn't get it.  So, I pulled the race card on him.  I called him that he is racist for assuming that the ID belongs to another Asian guy and told him to bring out the manager.  The bouncer still stood strong after that threat, because he knew that he is right which he was.  The arguing voice got raised to a yelling voice fueled by alcohol.  I remember saying something like, ""I see, so this is how you treat Asians? and mad that some of them are taller than you?""  The crowd gathered and, soon, the patrolling police showed up.  He wanted to see the ID and run it in the system.  It is real of course, but not mine.  He made me say 'my' address and all the info.  He, too, was confused about the height.  The licence was about a year old and I gained 3 inches and 40 lbs.  I told the police privately how I took growth hormones and began to workout, but didn't tell the bouncer since I am shameful of using hormones.  The police understood and made me get in.  I feel bad for that bouncer and would not have done what I did if I was not drunk.  However the wings were victoriously delicious.",Used race card to force myself into the bar with a help of police just so I can eat some cheap wings.,22,M,AskReddit
"Warning: Lots, LOTS of text. A huge skippable part. Kudos and a deep thanks from the bottom of my heart if you read it all. Please direct me to the correct subreddit if I've posted this in the wrong place or if I should crosspost it somewhere else. 
 I am a 20 year old IT student in Europe. Ever since I can remember myself I've either been a lazy sloth, depressed, or both. 
 
 Life backstory, massive segment. Skip to the bottom of the post if you want 
 Firstly, I've always been tormented by my past. When I was going to (non-university) school, I switched schools 2 times, one being when I was a kid and one as a teen. 
 There was really no huge reason I switched when I was a kid. My parents knew I had been bullied in the past (but mostly in soccer practice, not at school.) One day they asked me if I wanted to switch and I just said ""yes"". At the time I had a massive guilt feeling because I had stolen some 2€ electronic tamagotchi ripoff from a girl's bag during recess (I know, massive dickmove.) It felt like a way to get away from that in my 8 year old mind. That guilt continued to torment me every night 1-2 years after, until I just broke one night and told my dad when I was 10 or 11. 
 My parents are both teachers at different schools. I used to be at my mom's school and I got transferred to my dad's school at 9 years old. I hated my life when I got to that school. I made up imaginary friends and talked to them at recess. I often had nervous breakdowns for no reason. I would just collapse into crying for hours, which eventually my father grew tired of. I only had a handful of friends during that period, 2 being from that new school. They helped me stay sane. 
 When I was a teen it was a different reason. I got expelled for holding a deck of cards someone produced from their bag. The headmaster at that high school was a dick and I had more friends at the other school so I didn't have such a big problem transitioning. 
 
 So, to the present: I have a ton of insecurities. 
 For my entire life I've had a big gut and some moobs. While I don't consider myself a very overweight person, I could definitely drop some 30-35kg. 
 I also often find myself being very ""outside"" on social situations, or very aware of my depression in social situations. I feel awkward looking at others in the street. I think about my movements and expressions all the time. I find it difficult to converse with people who don't bring anything to the table of discussion, and they often leave me wondering how the hell they do it. 
 I find myself very worried about things that don't matter to my person. Sometimes I wonder whether it's worth to continue living when I read bullshit news on the internet about government spying or political/religious extremists. 
 I compare myself to others a lot. Sometimes I think ""wow, I wish I had accomplished half of what that person has"", and other times I think ""wow, at least I'm not a total loser like this person"". 
 But the most important thing has to be: My teeth. 
 When I was a kid my mom was yelling at me every night to wash my teeth and I wouldn't, just because I wanted to be a ""rebel"". This continued on to my teens, and even now, I wash my teeth mostly at mornings to get rid of bad breath. This has a direct effect on my everyday life. I think my smile looks like shit smeared with urine. When people take pictures with me inside them, I either do a slight smirk or make a funny face to avoid having to try smiling. I think that when people look at me they might think ""hey, he looks like a nice person"" but when I open my mouth they think much less of me. I visit my dentist maybe every 2 years, but I always have like 5-6 sessions of dental fillings each time after my initial visit. 
 On a different subect, I used to be pretty OK with the women. I haven't had sex in a few years but I lost my virginity in a relatively young age and am generally proud of the girls I've had in my life. Now I don't have any girls in my life who I believe are attracted to me. Every girl in this city seems much more snobbish and less likely to converse with a person like me. 
 
 The only eras of my life where I can distinctly remember being happy were: 
 
 When I was 13 and signed up for a Math tutoring class. I turned out to be pretty good at it, even though I previously considered myself a complete imbecile in that particular subject. 
 
 A period where I was stuck at home for a month, sick with mono (that I got from a girl who later moved to another city.) I was actually anticipating getting back out to the world. I had so many plans, getting out with friends, going on a diet, jogging and excercising. I ended up doing all those things for about 9 months. 
 
 The period after my final exams (the ones that placed me in my university), including my first semester after moving to the new city where my university was. 
 
 
 Now, I want to present what happened AFTER those periods. 
 
 I eventually stopped working because I reached a point where I thought ""hey I'm good"" and fucked myself over for years to come. I got depressed again. 
 
 After one month of being homestuck, I started my progress very pumped. I lost a lot of weight. People would look at me and go ""wow, you've lost a lot of weight!"" and I'd feel so good about myself. I really think my final exam year being right afterwards fucked that good momentum up. I was very anxious about having to study a whole lot to go somewhere good. Ironically, I didn't study as much as I spent time worrying about the future. I was very depressed during the entire period of the final exams. For the first time in years, I cried after doing bad on a specific subject at which I thought I would do well. 
 
 I got psychologically addicted to smoking weed. I fucked up an entire semester and I'm still trying to fix the damage for that. The weed here isn't even that good anymore. 
 
 
 I'm trying to quit the weed for starters, but it's so difficult. My dealers are... convenient. They come to my house, we smoke, I give them money, they bring me the stuff, and I don't see them again until after a week. I met one of them during my 2nd happy period. I've known him for a long time and I don't want to completely cut him off of my life... but the whole weed aspect I could do without. 
 Backstory ends here 
 
 I am depressed constantly and I'm always thinking about my past and insecurities. I hate what I see when I look at the mirror. I've tried, time and time again, to get my life back on track, to be who I want to be, but to no avail. I fall back into the old habits and the cycle starts again. 
 I want to be: 
 
 Mentally and physically healthy 
 Fit (Lean, I don't have a massive hardon for muscles but I don't mind getting them eventually) 
 A social person, a good conversationalist 
 A leader, someone others can turn to for help 
 Not addicted to drugs or other sources of dopamine like video games or excessive fapping to porn",I hate myself but I also care about myself. I feel like I am losing my mind.,20,M,getdisciplined
"Hi everyone, 
 So I'm a 26 year old male who is classified as obese on the BMI scale. In the past few months, I've noticed myself drinking a lot more but I attributed to dry mouth from a psychotropic medication called Trazodone for sleep and also a sudden chain smoking habit. I carry a big water bottle outside with me when I go to smoke so my mouth doesn't dry up. 
 But just recently, I've noticed how many times I've been urinating a day. It's usually clear to a light yellow color and a lot of it. So I asked my father yesterday if diabetes runs in his side of the family because I know it doesn't on my Mother's side. He told me yes, my aunt had it, my grandmother had it, and my great grandmother had it. He didn't know what type they were but he got me a script for a full blood test which is happening on Saturday and I am scared as hell. 
 I've been diagnosed with several mental illnesses since I was 11 and have been on and off so many medications. When I started Zoloft at 11, I gained quite a bit of weight but it eventually started coming off.  I stayed on that medication for years until 2009 where I was switched to Pristiq (which is like Effexor) and that made me gain weight at first but again, I was down to a normal weight shortly thereafter. In 2011 is where the big weight gain began. I was a normal weight, eating like your average human being but then I was put on a drug called Gabapentin which is very much known for weight gain. I gained 50 lbs within 3 months and it didn't stop. Flash forward to 2013, I was put on Abilify, another weight gainer and after a few months on that, I was up to 275lbs (6'1""). My major depression along with my other anxiety disorders became such a burden on me that I left work and eventually received social security disability. If anyone knows what major depression is like, they'll understand that while it's always present, there are times where you'll be able to mildly function and there are times where even taking a shower or brushing your teeth seems like climbing Mt. Everest. 
 In Mid-may of this year, I was at a functioning point where I decided to turn my life around. I was going to the gym at least 4 times a week, doing cardio and resistance training. Eating very well. And then all of the sudden, the depression came back and hit me and I became inactive again. 
 I became so depressed that I began chain smoking, as I mentioned above. I smoke about a pack a day now. It's horrible, I hate it but it's seemed to be my only crutch. So yesterday, before my conversation with my father, diabetes wasn't even on my mind. It was actually a great day because it was the first time I saw a new cognitive behavioral therapist, we discussed my body image issues and how my goals were to manage this depression, get back to the gym and get healthy. I was feeling so hopeful. 
 But shortly after that, I was becoming frustrated with my mouth drying out so I did some research and all signs pointed to diabetes. I kept drinking more water, peeing about after fifteen minutes, and even had a panic attack after speaking with my Dad because I know things were not looking good for me. 
 As far as other common symptoms go, there seems to be no blurred vision or unexpected weight loss. But I now know the major two and a lot of the time- I experience them. 
 I know I mentioned that I am obese, there is some family history and I do have native american blood on my father's side. But I've been trying to reason with myself (in a constant state of panic) that perhaps this IS just dry mouth from one of my medications and maybe I have a compulsion to drink a lot water just because. Maybe it could be a combination between dry mouth and chain smoking which could also be another compulsion to drink water. I do have two anxiety disorders and it seemed before that whenever I got anxious, I had to pee. Anxiety urination is apparently a real thing as well. However, thirst and frequent urination is the telltale sign of diabetes. 
 I couldn't sleep last night. The panic got to me. Today I was depressed so I woke up for a while, tried to watch a movie but just went back to sleep because I didn't want to deal with thinking about it. 
 The one interesting thing that I noticed last night was that I didn't eat all day (probably because I smoke a lot during the day) but when I forced myself to eat a salad late at night, the dry mouth definitely lessened. I didn't feel ""thirsty"", but I kept grabbing for my water bottle anyway. So maybe it does have something to do with OCD, drinking a lot of water for whatever reason and just urinating because I drink a lot of water. 
 And I would also like to know what excessive thirst is compared to dry mouth. I don't have cotton mouth, my tongue doesn't feel completely dry. And it's never really been like a thirst that say you may have on a hot summer day and you want to grab an Iced Tea. 
 But here's the thing, many of you may not be able to sympathize with me and that's fine. There is a lot of stigma in mental illness but I am being completely honest when I tell you it's controlled my life since I was 11. Taking this step to do cognitive behavioral therapy was huge for me because my psychiatrist told me we're running out of options and even wanted to refer me to an electroconvulsive specialist. 
 I know T2 diabetes is not a death sentence if you don't make it one. But living will mental illness and then adding this on top of it? It's like- I'm sorry my medication made me gain so much weight, I'm sorry that I became inactive due to clinical depression, but what kind of ""god"" would do this to me? I think that's just me venting because I'm scared and angry. 
 I've read about managing T2 diabetes. I have a general understanding of what you need to do to control it. But how am I going to work simultaneously with a new therapist to manage my mental illness? Mental illness can't just take a back seat if I'm diagnosed with T2. I'm not even sure this therapy is going to work and my psychiatrist says my next option would be shock therapy?! Damn. 
 I hope at least some one out there can sympathize. 
 Bottom line is, I don't know if I have it. I spoke to one of my T1 diabetic friends yesterday and he says he's almost certain I don't but I think maybe he was just trying to calm me down before I find out that I do. My father says his guess is that it's unlikely but wants me to get tested immediately. Sister says, ""You probably don't have it"". My Mother says, ""Drinking lots of water and peeing clear is healthy!"" She's funny. 
 I spoke to some of you on IRC last night and you seem like a great bunch of people. The most common thing I heard was, ""see a doctor"" and of course I was expecting that. I'm just on edge. 
 I'd like to hear from some of you that maybe I don't have it but I have a feeling I'll get responses like ""only your doctor can tell you"". But man, the waiting... especially with anxiety disorders. I have to go on Sunday for the full blood workup and I don't know how fast I'll get them back and that's just the beginning. Others on IRC were mentioning oral glucose tests (or something along those lines) and possibly other tests to be sure. 
 I know I've said it plenty of times, but I am scared. Being diagnosed at a young age may even lead to complications in my 30s or 40s. It's all just overwhelming.","I can't really summarize everything I spoke about that easily but I'm young and scared of T2 because of having to managing it with my mental illnesses. 
 P.s. I have thing about my finger tips. They're really sensitive and I hate the sight of any blood. Just so I'm prepared, are there any glucose meters that don't require pinching your fingertips to draw blood? I feel like I've seen an infomercial about one. Maybe I'll do some more research.  sigh",26,M,diabetes
"So I have an unresolved conflict that has been hanging over my brother and I for the past few years and I'd really like to find a way for us to get past it. I'm really hoping you guys can help shed some perspective on it. I'm going to try to give an objective telling of what happened before I go into my side and what I understand of my brother's side. Sorry if this is kind of disjointed, full of phone errors, and, obviously, skewed a bit towards myself 
 The Events: 
 My brother (Jack, 26 at the time), his girlfriend (Lisa, 21f) and I (22m) were all hanging out and drinking at their apartment in Summer of 2010. Their roommate/Lisa's sister (Allison, 24f) came home also innebriated, hung out, and played board games with us. This was only the second time that I'd met her. She and I flirted quite a bit and ended up making out/spooning on the couch together after Jack and Lisa went to bed. 
 The next day my Jack texted me, asking how it was but also saying that it probably wasn't a good idea to try and date her, as she had apparently just broken up with her long term boyfriend, though he said they were constantly in a kind of limbo. I said OK, and went on with my day. A couple days later, Allison started messaging me on Facebook. A while into the conversation, she clarified her relationship as being over. A couple days later, we set up a date in a park. 
 We dated for a short month and a half, with Allison and I hanging out with Jack and Lisa fairly regularly. He'd become more and more distant, less talkative around me, and would make comments about Allison that I felt had passive aggressive undertones. When it was just him and I, he would tell me about all of his beefs with Allison. During this time, I talked to some friends and family, and all the advice I got was to break up with Allison to save my relationship with my brother, which I ended up doing as Jack and I started getting more argumentative with each other. 
 Allison and I been hanging out at a bar and she was trying to guilt trip me into going home with her, rather than continue hanging out with friends who I'd not seen in a long time (the friend meetup had been planned for weeks, as well). I elected to continue hanging out with the friends. Allison took this, I'm guessing, as my way of breaking up with her, evidenced by the string of angry freak out text messages. It wasn't meant to be, and before she left we'd even made plans to hang out the next day. However, this was enough of an excuse for me to actually end things with her. 
 Since then, Jack has poked fun at me (thinking that the act of dating Allison was dumb of me), both to my face as well as to the rest of the family. He has since married Lisa, so we still see Allison every once in a while. Every time we do, Allison and I are fine, but Jack will make comments to me like ""Are you going to be able to restrain yourself this time, grogtron?"" Or, my favorite, ""Yeah, she's dating some new idiot. Poor guy, huh grogtron?"" 
 Jack's perspective: 
 Allison was a trouble roommate to Jack and Lisa. The term ""crazy"" was used often, and he hinted once that she might be schizophrenic. I think Jack legitimately does not like her. He moved in with Lisa only after a couple months of dating, after he'd moved out of town to help take care of our sick dad then moving back without a place to live. Allison was high maintenance, did not like messes, and was a sleep eater (as in she would sleep walk at night and eat all their leftovers/bread/stuff). She was a source of stress for Jack and he was worried that any drama that happened between Allison and I would carry over to his home life. He also told me that he was trying to do the big brother thing and protect me from Allison hurting me. He uses her freaking out on me when it ended as an indicator that I ""got out just in time."" 
 My perspective: 
 It had been a really rough year for both Jack and I, as our dad died of cancer in the Fall of 2009. At the time that this all happened, I felt really isolated and alone. I was living with my best friend at the time, but he had no idea how to talk to me after my dad died, so he mostly stayed in his room playing WOW. My brother was in the honeymoon phase with Lisa, so we weren't hanging out as much as we used to, and when we did, he was texting with her constantly. I was relying on phone calls with an ex-girlfriend that I'd broken up with about a year before for emotional support. Allison had been really supportive about Dad for the brief time we were together, and it made me feel better to have someone to spend time with. I was also excited about the opportunity to be able to hang out with my brother more, them being roommates and all. I knew she and I weren't going to be a long term thing so I wasn't mad that we didn't last forever.Outside of the drama, I liked her, though, and don't feel guilty or regretful about seeing her. I suppose I'm mad that I feel like my brother turned it into an unspoken ultimatum. It's especially frustrating that he tries to make fun of me for it. It feels like I gave something up specifically for him and now he's rubbing it in my face. 
 It may also be important to mention that there's been friction between Lisa and I, both before and after these events. She's usually fine, but she used to be an asshole when she drank. This is much better now, but she would be too handsy--Hugs, touching my face/head, being way too far into my personal space bubble--with me for my comfort, occasionally made offhand joke comments about her, Jack, and I in a threesome, once hit Jack in the face with a TV remote out of anger, and one time scratched the shit out of my arm during casual conversation and called me a pussy when it started to bleed. Her and Jack almost broke up the night of that last one. Since then, she's been a lot better and we get along well, but I still try to avoid drinking with her. 
 What's happening now: 
 We don't really talk about Allison much, but when we do, it devolves to an angry argument fairly quickly. As I said, he's married to Lisa now, so Allison is still around every once in a while. I've talked to him about not making fun of me for it (which he misinterpreted as an admission of guilt), so he stopped doing it directly to me but has apparently been continuing with other siblings (I found out when our drunk older sister tried making fun of me for it last Christmas while I was giving her a ride home, basically parroting Jack). 
 He and I are both very stubborn, prideful, and, honestly, probably a little too full of ourselves. Neither of us are great at heart-to-hearts. I know that we were both in the wrong on this and that there's no easy answer. The events are all done and finished and all that's left over is lingering resentment. I love my brother and I want to clear the air, especially as they're going to have a kid very soon. How can we move forward from here? 
 Here's the","of events:

"I had a shitty last two years. I was a drug addicted dealer who was 
 caught and barely managed to avoid jail time, but I went into a spiral 
 of depression and drug abuse. During this time I was dating this 
 chick, she is a nice girl but has severe anxiety issues, she has 
 frequent panic attacks and would rather smoke an ungodly amount 
 of weed to handle it than deal with it. She is in college but never goes 
 to class and is still taking her freshmen year credits her third year in 
 because she keeps failing classes by not going and not doing the 
 work. She broke up with me because I was fucked up all the time 
 and I got worse and worse until I eventually sought help, detoxed 
 and went on meds. It took a long time but I'm doing much better 
 now, I'm actually being weaned off my antidepressants at the 
 moment. I enrolled back at school (community but hey) and got a 
 legitimate soul crushing job. So she and I began spending more time 
 together (same circle of friends) and she'd hang at my place with my 
 roomies for periods of 6-12 hours a day, I didn't care because she 
 was just watching TV and getting high with my roomies. I was still 
 friendly with her (touching, being flirty, calling her pet names) just in 
 a teasing manner because she was so stoned and I found it hilarious. 
 Eventually she asked to talk and asked me if I wanted to get back 
 together, I honestly didn't. I was just getting my shit together and 
 was afraid to go back into any sort of intimate relationship but she 
 looked like she was gonna cry when I tried politely telling her no, so I 
 said yes. I still like her but all she wants to do is spend 12+ hours a 
 day in her bed, sleeping and having sex (my sex drive isn't up to par 
 with hers). Smoking weed and being a housebody. I have started to 
 miss days of work, days of class and I smoked a bit of weed (I quit all 
 drugs but I feel awkward being sober when she asks if I want to take 
 a hit). I had to drop out of a class this semester because I missed too 
 many days. My work is pissed because I keep calling in sick. I have 
 things to do but she is always around and sorta just gets me to 
 ignore my responsibilities to just hang with her. I don't want to 
 spend 18 hours a day with her, I keep trying to tell her she needs to 
 be more independent and let me do my thing but she just laughs it 
 off and I can't be assertive. I like her and want to be with her but I 
 need space, at least enough space to accomplish my ambitions in life 
 but she needs constant affection, it's getting to be too much. How do 
 I tell her she needs help and I can't be that help? I don't want to lose

"I'm not submitting this to /r/tifu because this is the culmination of seven or eight years of events. 
 Listen to my story, /r/ForeverAlone. 
 Seven years ago, I was in eighth grade. I was fat, my voice hadn't dropped yet, and I was highly antisocial. I was a prime target for bullying, and had very few friends in school. One of them was this girl I knew from elementary school who I would sometimes walk through the halls while changing classes or meet up with her after school near the bike racks. We had a few similar interests, like anime. The people bullying me started to talk about how I was going out with her, and being the little antisocial idiot that I was, I distanced myself from her. During this time, I only thought of her as a friend. 
 The next year, we met again in high school. Another friend of mine went with her to homecoming that year, and I really didn't care. I just saw her as a friend. He really got on her nerves, so she started to dislike him. I still thought of her as just a friend. 
 During my sophomore year of high school, I didn't have anything to do during lunch, as I didn't feel hungry due to my medication. I spent lunch in the library playing Yu-Gi-Oh for pretty much the entire year with some other nerds. But come the second semester, the girl from before changed classes and wound up with the same lunch period. She didn't have anything to do either, so she would come sit with me during lunch, and we would talk. She'd also come to the library in the mornings and hang out with me and some of the friends I'd made in high school. I started to intensely dislike the friend from before, and she and I sort of bonded over that. I still thought of her as just a friend. 
 I forget what happened throughout most of junior and senior year, but I do recall one incident where I did something for her and she returned the favor with a hug. I still thought of her as just a friend. 
 The summer after we graduated, I finally decided to join Facebook because I wanted to reconnect with some of the people I befriended in high school. The aforementioned girl added me, and I accepted her friend request. I still thought of her as just a friend. 
 Fast forward two years to yesterday afternoon. For the past few weeks or so, I've been internally bemoaning the fact that I've never had a girlfriend. When I laid down to take an afternoon nap, she suddenly popped into my head. I remembered all the time we had spent together. I remembered all the stories she had told me about things that happened in school. I realized that we could have had something together. I realized that she may have even had a crush on me. I immediately checked Facebook for her. I couldn't find her in my friends list, so I just tried searching for her using the search function. No dice. She must have deleted her account or something, and I have no way to contact her now. I went to work that night, and my mind was taken off of her for the time being. But when I got home, it all came flooding back to me. This is the saddest I've felt in a very long time. 
 Even if it's just once, even if she's already in a relationship, I want to see her again.",I let the closest person I ever had to being a girlfriend get away.,25,M,ForeverAlone
"So this had been eating at me and I need to just get it out, and ask for some advice. I walked in on my husband jerking off. Now normally this wouldn't bother me at all. But our sex life is shit. I have to always initiate, and it is always followed by a sigh and eyeroll, because god forbid your wife asks you for sex. 
 And what really annoys me is he asks me to come upstairs to hang out with him, so I do for a couple hours, and it's 1am so I say ""I'm going to bed it's a work night, you coming?"" he says ""Ya in one minute."" Okay it is now 1:30am so I go out of our bedroom and the door to the computer room is shut, I open it, and walk in on him. 
 Like really? Your wife is in the next room naked in bed and you choose to jerk it??? 
 His excuse always is he's ""tired"" or I ask to late (but apparently jerking it at 1am isn't?), basically anytime after 9pm. Well sorry our son doesn't go to bed till 9pm so wtf am I supposed to do? 
 I want to walk from this marriage. I have for a long time. We have a long tack record of him emotionally cheating on me. He hasn't that I know of in over a year. I haven't because we have a kid, and honestly I have no money or anywhere to go. 
 I'mm 22 fucking years old, I'm not ready for a dead bedroom for the rest of my life. 
 Should this bug me so much? Or I am just being a bitch for feeling this way?","Caught husband jerking, but he never wants sex.",22,F,relationships
"Hey guys,
I'm a 24 M and my girlfriend is 22. We've been together for about 3 years now. Awhile ago, a friend told me about a message app called Kik and I've been using it for about a couple weeks, never before for sexting or anything like that although I've now learned that's one of the main purposes of this thing. 
 Anyway, I won't get into exactly how because that would be a pretty long story, but I got a woman's Kik that wanted to start sexting. She was single and a couple years older than me. I knew from the beginning it was wrong to be doing this... but when she started initiating the sexting, I was sort of exciting and I really didn't think about it. She asked for a picture of me, but I was way too nervous to send a picture of myself and it might get out in some way...so I got one from Google (yes, I know this story is pathetic beyond words). 
 Anyway, after I did that, she sent one back to me, and I know it was her 100% and not from the Internet like I'd sent her. The second after I saw it, I wanted to vomit. Everything I had done suddenly came to me and my stomach churned with the guilt I should have been feeling all along. I immediately blocked her and later deleted the application. 
 This happened about a half hour ago and my stomach has been in knots ever since. I can't believe that I would stoop to something that low. I've been faithful our entire relationship and she's the best thing to ever happen to me. 
 My question is - should I tell my girlfriend about this? It would absolutely destroy her and the thought of that conversation makes me sick.",Sexted another girl while in a relationship once and immediately cut off all contact with the other girl. Should I tell my girlfriend?,24,M,relationships

"Im a 19 year old male, ive been using webcam sites for quite a while now, but 3 months ago i met a girl,she is 20 years old, on a cam girl site and i instantly fell in love. Before u jump to conclusions i didnt fall in lust. 
 I have to pay to spend time with her, and when i do spend time with her its like something ive never experienced before. I pay for a exclusive or private session and we just talk the whole time, there has never been anything sexual related in the times im with her. I dont intend of ever telling her to expose to herself to me, even tho most of her shows are quite innocent anyways. I thought i was in love with the girl in my previous relationship, but this is on another level. 
 She also loves when it i come on and say hi and when i spend some time with her, but it kills me because i cant afford to spend time with her all the time. I asked her about talking outside of the website however, sharing any form of personal details whether by speech or written text is strictly forbidden on these sites and since one girl was fired for this reason 5 weeks ago for this exact thing she is quite reluctant to share any details. 
 Anyways ive just been meaning to get it off my chest and ask for what to do. I cant stop thinking about her, she is perfect in every single way, her smile sends shivers down my spine. Shit thing is, she is on the otherside of the world. And yes i have confessed my love to her. 
 P.s im very mature for my age so dont tell me im too young and stupid to know what love is.","Im in love with a beautiful woman who happens to be a camgirl but due to cam girl websites rules she cant give me any personal details, and it kills me not being able to spend time with her and i cant stop thinking about her, and i dont know what to do!",19,M,relationships
"I'm depressed right now. I've been with my agent for 7 months and haven't gotten a single audition which is one reason. 
 Second reason is I live in the Chicago area right now and I really fucking hate it here. Just being here and not in LA or somewhere else is causing me to feel quite a bit down. I feel like I have no opportunities here. Even the auditions I do have for indie/student films I rarely land because I feel like I'm not a fit for the part even prior to the audition. 
 I get good feedback from most people after I audition. ""Great job!"" ""Loved it!"" ""Great interpretation!"" ""I'd love to work with you in the future!"" 
 However, the parts I go out for just never seem to be a fit for my type. I'm a 5'7 white dude with a young face and I'm only 24, yet I'm going out for roles where even though my age meets the breakdown list, the age range requested in the first place is wrong. 
 For example, I had an audition where I was the boss firing a bad worker. Nothing about me screams ""he's the boss!"". I'm too young looking for that, so I'm basically out of the running. 
 As far as how the dismal prospects are, I don't care at all about how many times I get turned down for roles. I care about the fact that I hardly audition. 
 I'd rather go on 10,000 auditions and not nab a single part than not audition at all. 
 Yet, I feel like here, I'm not going to even get to audition #100 until I hit about 60 years of age.","My prospects and my general feelings about where I live are making me depressed and it also screws with my head.

"F/207/5'3) My new years resolution was to loose weight and get fit. I have been struggling after I had some bad experiences with birth control and a diagnosis of PCOS, but I decided enough was enough. I came back to school on January 7th and since I have lost 18 pounds. I go to the gym 5 days a week and I am taking a few classes, one is called aqua boot camp. 
 Anyway, I have gone twice a week since school started and I didn't really noticed a difference until yesterday. 
 We were in a circle treading water with just our legs and then we started passing this brick around. Normally 10 pounds but in the water its more like 3 but still. So we get it half around the circle and it drops. So we began the process again with another brick. Within seconds it has a new home at the bottom of the pool as well. 
 Our instructor decides to move on with something else for the rest of class but the OCD in me is screaming about the bricks in the pool. So after everyone is out, she is about to dive in but she didn't want to get her hair wet. She looks up I am still in the pool, she jokes and says I should get it instead. A few weeks ago I would have laughed, but I swam down grabbed the brick and brought it back up. 
 Beyond excited, I got the other one as well. My instructor was super excited that I was able to do this (and not just because her hair stayed dry) she had me stay a few minutes after to try treading with the brick, and I could! It was still under the water and only for like 20 seconds at a  time but I did it! And I have another half of the quarter to go!",After 5 weeks of aqua boot camp I can successfully swim/treat water while holding a 10 pound brick!,20,F,loseit
"Very well put. The problem with drink in this country is, that if you want to quit its exceedingly hard because we're a nation of enablers. I knocked the booze on the head for a few weeks during the summer and it was only then I realised all the areas of day to day life it show's up in. Call over to a mates? ah sure you'll have a bottle. Watch a movie? gotta have some wine. Make it two bottles just in case you get the thirst on ya,etc. I'm deffo drinking MORE because of our licencing laws too. I want to save money before I go out so I always by more offy than I need and drink quicker than I should. Our nanny state laws mean we can't get anything after 10 so I don't want to end up running out if there's a bit of craic going on after the club or pub or whatever. I've found as I've grown older the amount of times I drink a week has reduced but weekends often become ridiculous binges. The craic is mighty when it lasts but the hangovers and general fear after is deffo getting worse. I can feel the anxiety creeping up on me all day, its not a nice feeling.

"This is my first post on Reddit, so please be kind to me if I make any etiquette mistakes and let me know! 
 My name is Victoria. I am in a fucked up relationship with Luke that appears to be perfect to everyone else, possibly my partner too. We have been together for three years. He is from the United Kingdom and I am from somewhere else in Europe. He is the first man I've ever loved. My first kiss, my first everything. We met at a time in my life that was very delicate. Being overweight and really insecure about my appearance, I thought I was going to stay alone forever. The first few months of our relationships were the happiest of my life, but also hard as we had to have a long distance relationship. 
 I  NEED  to break up with him, but I cannot do it. 
Here are some reasons why I need to end this:
 He says he would never get married or have children with me, although I told him how important these things would be for me and my Christian family.  Some of his views are highly misogynistic 
 He believes I am stupider than him. Luke treats me like I am an idiot.  Whenever I try to confront him on an issue, he always turns it around and makes it look like I am in the wrong, although it is rarely the case. He takes advantage of English not being my native language. 
 He hates all my friends and he heavily criticizes my family.  He never likes anything (shows, movies, etc) that I show him, sometimes before watching them. Once again, he thinks he is superior to me. 
 He is very volatile and easily angered. He throws stuff and he screams. I suffer from anxiety.  He says horrible, disturbing things and he says he wants to kill himself although he only does it to get my attention when it is not 100% on him. 
 He never makes me orgasm. I fake everything, even if it feels good.  He likes fat. So, after working my ass off and losing 8 kilos before meeting him, I gained back more than 30 ( 66 lbs) and he wanted me to gain more for his sexual pleasure. 
*I have overall antagonized him and I want to focus on myself. 
 Even with all these reasons, I am acting like a coward and pretending that everything is fine to avoid any sort of confrontation. Here are some reasons that are preventing me from breaking up with him. 
 When we have our good moments, they are amazing.  We cuddle a lot and it is the best feeling in the world. 
 He is learning a language for me.  We share a house while we study, at least until June. 
 I owe him a lot of money.  His family loves me.
 I am his only friend and he would be alone, as his relationship with his family is not the best.  I owe him a lot of money. 
 Did I say I am a huge coward and would never have the courage to tell him?  He has some sort of mental disorder and he is too fragile. I am afraid he might actually kill himself. 
 His mother is really sick.  I don't love him as much, but I still care about him and he is my best friend. 
*I can talk about almost everything with him. 
 What should I do? I am so lost and confused. Please help me.","I know I have to break this up. I just cannot bring myself to do it because I care too much about him and we share a house, with me owning him a lot of money. What should I do?",26,F,relationships
"eh. everyone has their own pace at which they learn stuff and the only real way to improve how quickly you pick any of this up is to immerse yourself in it in a way that you just have more experience. When it comes down to it a lot of things are the same, all computer languages break down into the same elements, all websites and programs have their staple functionaltiies and every programmer has similar ways of getting things done with these programs so once you force yourself o experience these things hands on and more often you start to notice patterns and soon enough you be able to open a new program like fl studio and figure it out in a week or so.

"Everyone posts such big introductions on here. 
 I'm a 21 year old male. Two years ago I was dating a girl who preferred fast food and Mountain Dew over eating actual food, so from graduation to breaking up with her in late 2011 I was stuck around 220 lbs. After leaving her I wound up looking in the mirror and being very unhappy with what I saw. So I stopped drinking soda completely, cut out almost all fast food (DQ Blizzards are my weakness) and started running. 
 I became more active during the summer. I didn't have much money to spend so I would do push ups, crunches, squats and whatever workouts I could find on the internet and then I would run a mile. I found that mile slowly went from 11+ minutes to 10, then 9 1/2. I also noticed myself breathing less and less hard when I got home from the run. I started biking to work (8 miles there, 8 miles back, variable up/downhill both ways). Winter came and I got a gym membership and started working out more often, usually two or three times a week. 
 And now, just over a year after quitting fast food and soda, I'm sitting between 170 and 180 lbs at ~15% body fat. My goal is to be as close 170 lbs and 9-10% body fat as possible by mid summer, because who doesn't want a sexy beach body? I recently heard about loseit and figured I would give this a shot. I'm looking forward to getting advice and sharing my progress (or failure) with you all.","I dated a fast food/pop addict, broke up, hated how I looked and lost 40-50 lbs in a year.

"I'm a waitress at a very small restaurant, about 30 staff overall maybe I would say.  Most of the time I worked there, I had a boyfriend, but a lot of the guys there still flirted with me anyway, even though they knew it wasn't going anywhere.  However, I've been single for a little over a year now. 
 A girl I work with, who I am also just becoming friendly with outside of work, decided that a guy we work with and me would make a good couple.  I sort of laughed it off and didn't think anything of it since she didn't bring it up to me again.  But then she told me that she told him the same thing, and she said at first he laughed it off too, but then he said something to her like, I would never give him the time of day, or something to that effect.  She told him she though I might.  This was a few weeks ago, so I forgot all about it. 
 Now he's messaged me on Facebook with his number saying I should text him sometime.  I don't want to ignore it, but I don't really want to go out with him either, which although he hasn't said it here, I can't imagine why else he would want me to text him.  He's a nice enough guy, but we don't have a thing in common.  I can't even imagine what we would talk about if he took me on a date.  I work there because I couldn't find any other work after college.  I left last year to teach English in France for the school year, and just came back a few months ago because, again, couldn't get a job.  I might be leaving in a few months to teach English in China (it's very preliminary yet, only a few close friends know it's a possibility).  He has no education, delivers for this restaurant and also works landscaping, and as far as I can tell, he doesn't have a lot of wider interests outside of his cars and drinking. 
 I guess I could go out with him once and tell him I don't think we have enough in common, but I kinda don't want people I work with to know that I went out with him.  He dated another girl I worked with and I wasn't exactly impressed by his boyfriend behavior I guess.  Additionally, I am recovering from vaginismus.  I don't really sense he's the kind of guy who would be understanding, and I would be terrified that he might tell people, though that conversation wouldn't have to happen for a while. 
 Should I just tell him no?  I don't want to date a coworker?  I don't think we have enough in common?  How on earth should I handle this???  He's a nice guy, I don't want to be a bitch, but I honestly don't think a relationship would ever work out between us. 
 Also my real issue at the moment is how to respond to this message he sent me.  He hasn't actually asked me out, so I know I should calm down, but like I said, I can't imagine why else he would have messaged me his number like that. 
 Can I just message him back ""thanks for your number""?  Is that weird?  I don't know what I'm supposed to do here. 
 Thanks r/relationships.  Hoping I didn't come off like a bitch in this post.","Coworker I like but I'm not interested in and have nothing in common with messages me with his number saying I should text him sometime.  What do?

"I realized I have a problem and by removing it I could enjoy life even more. 
 I'm 24M and I am a very introverted person (mix of ISTJ and INTJ) and I do enjoy this much but what I don't like is that I'm shy, get anxious when talking to new people and women and I have a huge lack of social skills. 
 I don't have a problem on the business side of things like work and interviews (i'm really confident there). I'm a programmer and I enjoy doing my job so I think I talk quite effectively with my coworkers to get the job done but besides that I don't really talk about anything else and I avoid outside work meetings like they're the devil. 
 Then on the other side of things I find it impossible to start a conversation with a stranger and have small-talk. I won't even go like how I am with girls, although somehow in a computer camp I got my first girlfriend and at uni i got the 2nd which i'm stable. Also around her I can talk random shit, sing, dance, I don't care. 
 Until now I felt good about it all, I mean why the fuck talk to strangers right? But now I think that I be missing out on something, also don't know how much will my ongoing relationship last so I decided to do something. 
 I will tell you that I'm most interested with improving social skills with girls more. 
 So my first task for today was to ask a girl for the time.
Got out from the bus one stop earlier just so I could make contact.
I was terrified and making excuses all along the way and I got to work without asking one single female what is the time. Man i really suck. 
 Had a somewhat shitty day at work and cus the lack of intellectual satisfaction I tried to ask for the time while going home.
After some failed attempts on my side I finally managed to ask a girl coming from the other direction, the time. From my reading she had a face of ""what do you want from me?"" but oh well I managed to find out the time (like i didn't know it) and felt good. Several minutes later in the park another girl is coming to me to give me a flier. I decided to take this opportunity and because she had a white/black striped dress I asked (maybe too seriously) ""where did you escape from?"" but she didn't get the convict joke and that was a bit awkward. 
 So my plan for the future is to practice asking for time, then move on to directions cus it's a bit more involved, then just give compliments then hopefully do some small talk. 
 Now i also have to make a plan about being more social in general, at work, outside of work with work-mates. 
 Any advice about any of this is much appreciated.

"My story is probably a typical one, always been a large and in charge dude, but I have a body frame that hides my weight pretty good, no one has ever guessed me over 250.  Ever since middle school I gradually put on weight and never really paid attention.  I come from a family of large folk with bad eating habits, most famously serving ""healthy"" foods like vegetables...covered in half a stick of margarine.  Things like that. 
 Anyway, I've battled with insecurity, self esteem, all that run of the mill stuff.  But something in me finally snapped, Lambert the Sheepish Lion style, last August.  The wife and I are a bit rocky, it's a sitcom marriage, she's 5'8"", 125lbs, tall, blonde, never understood what it was like to be fat (until she got pregnant).  And here's me, Cap'n Fatty McGee not giving a shit.  Anyway, I hate exercise, I hate dieting, I hate calorie counting, I hate sweating, overall I'm a lazy fuck. 
 I started losing weight last August by just eating less.  I eat the same shitty food, but less, this lifestyle change helped me lose 32lbs so far.  A big help getting me going has been anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds.  Over the years my drive has just dwindled down to a pattern of self-destructive bad habits and I could not get out of the funk.  I talked to my doctor and she suggested that a big part of wanting to change but not being able to is chemical.  Anyway, taking a low dose of zoloft and wellbutrin (I know, it's different for everyone) gave me that little push I needed, that push to actually get off of my 310lb fat ass and do something. 
 Yesterday...I walked into a gym.  I haven't been in a gym since high school.  I spent a good deal of time talking with the staff and all my build-ups and anxieties were really shut down, I've taken the first step to continuing this path.  I'm going to save up a little money and get started in the coming weeks with a personal trainer.  Gym, exercise and nutrition is a big mysterious cloud of scary for me, but no more.  I want to be fucking hot.  I want to have my wife drag me to the bedroom with lust filled eyes.  I want my kids to look at me and wonder if I'm really a superhero because my arms will be stretching my shirt.  I want to walk into any room and know I'm not the fattest guy in there, that I'm not going to have to worry about bending over because my ass crack will hang out.  I want to be able to enjoy the beach and hot weather and not have to live with the fact that I haven't had my shirt off in public since the 80's.  These are things I want and I'm going to take. 
 I know I'm rambling and thank you if you've read this far.  I just want this to be in /r/loseit because I hope that there is some other person out there, around my age or weight that is on the fence or needs a little push or is naturally lazy and has REALLY and HONESTLY tried everything they thought could work.

"So long story short I'm a 22 yr old student living in Suburbia, USA (I lived in Chicago for a while so the suburbs still kinda freak me out). ANYWAY, like most other suburbanites its like WTF is there to do?! I have been working out a ton, might hit the gym soon as my at home workouts aren't as challenging as they used to be, going on bike rides, etc. So I'm on day 3 right now (third attempt but feeling good) and I had to go go the mall to buy a gift for someone. Usually I HATE the mall, esp in the burbs. I was gonna eat there until I was walking thru the food court and saw a family eating Sbarros with their shoes off :0. 
 SO I go to the store to get the gift and there was this chick there who looked like 24/25 she was really pretty. Tan with light eyes. Anyway she was very helpful, like I almost felt like she was flirting but I always feel weird 'flirting' with people providing you with a service bc like they have to be nice right? The store asks for your # I should have said like 'text me sometime' tongue in cheek. 
 Anyway so I'm leaving and this other chick at a jewelry store like flagged me down. I was walking past as she asked a question about what I bought, I answered, kept walking, and I heard her say something else. So the latter repeated and I walked back over to her. We talked for like 5 min about PartyLite but then her bosses started walking over so I told her if I needed jewelry I'd come and see her. 
 I hate sharing and I know I'm really early into this but yeah it was interesting. Makes me want to go out more. I feel like people actually want to talk to me.",SUBURBS ARE LAME BUT I HAD TO GO TO THE MALL AND I FELT SOME STRANGE AURA AROUND ME,22,M,NoFap
"So myself [18M] just went off to start my first year of college in August, and like most lazy people that are going to a school where they know no one, I used a random roommate. We will call him Jake. 
 Jake is another [18M] that is about the weirdest kid I have ever met. My parents and I believe he has some form of high-functioning Asperger's because one of my parents has taught Special Ed for the last 20 years. I described my observations to her and she agreed. 
 He reads over my shoulder as I text (after knowing him for 2 days at the time), he has to shower every morning AND night even if it is 3AM and I want ti sleep, he will ignore you, forcing you to ask the same innocent question at least three times, he talks very slow, he's got a ziplock bag full of pills sitting out, he will watch ESPN on his phone/TV whenever he can, even if we are in public or it is a rerun, talks very slow, walks on his toes, but worst of all, he STARES at the girls on campus. 
 It is fine if he is autistic, I just wanted to try to put his behavior in some sort of perspective. I've been stressed out because I have to take care of this guy when he's not in class because he seems to not be able to socially function on his own. It's okay if he's autistic, I just wish either he or the school told me so I could know I have to take care of him half the time. 
 I don't mean ""checking a cute girl out,"" I mean ""let me bore my eyes into this girl's forehead and get her to like me"" type staring. Someone even said something the other day to her friend along the lines of ""Ew why wouldn't that guy stop staring at me?"" 
 This takes us to my friend that I made during the first week. I have a girlfriend, and this girl, called Joan, has been hanging out in my room with my two other friends. (18 M and 18 F). The four of us have gotten pretty close so far this semester and hang out a lot, but Jake likes to hang out with us to, because I'm nice to him and he has no friends, and when he hangs with us, he stares at Joan. 
 Joan has gotten pretty uncomfortable. I asked Jake what he thinks of Joan and he said ""I'd do it."" Whatever that means. He follows her even more than he follows me, and says a creepy hello/goodbye whenever he sees her around campus. He doesn't seem to be stalking her, but they always seem to see each other, because campus is small. 
 Joan says she does not want to make a complaint yet; she wants to wait for classes to pick up and see how bad it gets or if Jake will get over her. I am uncomfortable FOR her and told her if she does make a complaint I will help her, but in the meantime, what do I do? I'm protective in nature but I don't want to wait for Jake to make a move or worse on Joan and have this turn into something awful.",My (possibly autistic) roommate has started making my friend feel uncomfortable because he sees her a low around campus and says hello/goodbye in a creepy way.

"Okay, I think I'm going insane. I just finished watching Inception for like the fifth time, and like always it made me go from being unaware and out of tune of my surroundings to being a little bit more in tune with life, and thinking deeper (dunno why). Now I'm just laying in bed, listening to music, and of course zoned out just thinking of random shit while trying to fall asleep. Anyways, one of the things that pops into my mind is how the human mind apparently can't properly grasp the concept of nothing; that is to say, in outer space, where there is absolutely nothing. Not even air filling a space, no molecules, no atoms, nothing. Thinking this through straight up blew my mind. Then I started thinking, is it even possible to have nothing? (note now, I'm 16, and my highest knowledge of science is being three quarters through a grade 12 chemistry class. I'm no science geek, although I doubt anyone that's reading this post will confuse me as such...anywho..) 
 Like what if simply we can't see whatever fills up the space that we presume to contain nothing? I'm not talking particles smaller than protons and electrons though...that's when another thought hit me. What if what we're (not) seeing is  bigger  than that. Bigger than protons, electrons and neutrons. Bigger than your basic atom, or even molecule. Some element that we haven't discovered yet, maybe with an unknown pigment or something so it's invisible? Like could there be something in a black hole that is simply undetectable by every possible human form of detection...and maybe that's the building block of the universe? Because if the universe is expanding, it seems that nothingness is expanding, which is something I can't grasp...yet if nothingness was actually something, with unknown properties of expansion, then wouldn't that make sense? Like an alternate dimension of chemical properties. 
 Hopefully one of the many science geniuses on here will see this and straight up own me...but in terms I can understand, so I can learn something. :) Or even better, maybe I've just come up with something revolutionary and I'll have my proposed unknown element named after me. vchizzleinium, I like.",I watched Inception and started to try and come up with an explanation for the universe.

"the arguments began pretty soon into out now 2-and-a-half year relationship. It stems primarily from our conflicting attitudes towards how we handle situations - I tend to fly off the handle and catastrophise, I suppose it could be described as a tantrum - and unfortunately I often forget there are 2 people in the relationship and only think about how a set back affects me. 
 My boyfriend wants a relationship where we can be each other's rock. Which is ultimately what I want, but coming from a family who weren't very close I find it harder to think of myself as part of a team and can be selfish. If there's a problem I snap at him, and instead of handling setbacks by considering the both of us, I tend to blame him for situations even when he's had no control over it. Even a tiny thing like not being able to eat at a particular restaurant suddenly becomes a ruined evening because I immediately look for blame and become passively aggressive. 
 I also suffer from anxiety which makes it all a lot worse. My boyfriend is very patient with this but I can see it's really wearing him down as he is basically there to support me through my trials and tribulations but I'm never able to do the same for him because I've always got some drama going on that I am being irrational about. 
 I've tried everything, meditation, mindfulness, medication. I can't stop being like this. And therefore we keep arguing. I can't think of a single weekend we've spent together where we haven't had at least one argument about the way I've handled something or my attitude. We've never broken up, but had been close several times. 
 Despite how it may seem, we really are in love. We swing from blazing rows to blissfully happy. He's never said a mean thing about me despite how difficult I am and he is as desperate as I am to get things right. 
 This is the third long term relationship I've had - and they've all been the same - constant arguments about my attitude. As cliched as it is- it's not him it's me. 
 Does it sound like it's worth trying to sort this out? We're at our wits end and just want a stable and solid relationship. How can I calm down and become a rationale person and not some psycho bitch girlfriend.",me (f27) and my boyfriend (m28) constantly argue because I'm so difficult - I need to change. What can I do?

"Question (more at the end of the post): 
 Will insurance companies evaluate a patient's case in depth if requested? Taking into account previous history and  quality of life . 
 
 Looooooong Background: 
 
 I was born with  cryptorchidism . In other words, my testicles were not in my scrotum when I was born. They were inside my abdomen. Most of the time, this isn't an issue and the testicles descend within about 3 months or less after a baby is born. Sometimes, like in my case, they are unable to descend. 
 To reverse this, surgeons performed an  orchiopexy . This is a surgery to attempt to manually move the testicles into the scrotum and make sure that they don't retract in the future. In my case during this procedure, one of the testicles was deemed to be non functional. Either due to complications or due to it not being able to regulate temperature and overheating. The other testicle was successfully moved to my scrotum but is now very tender to the touch. 
 To remove the bad testicle, an  inguinal orchiectomy  was performed and a prosthetic testicle was inserted and attached. 
 As a result of this, I assume. I have been  somewhat  diagnosed with low testosterone aka   male hypogonadism . That is, physically, there is something wrong with me, but according to the ""normal"" range on lab reports, I'm normal. 
 
 Some of my symptoms include: 
 
 
 Always tired, no energy, able to nap for multiple hours at a time if possible. Generally get about 7 hours of sleep a night.  
 
 
 
 Cannot concentrate on school or anything that requires higher level thinking. When I've been on testosterone replacement therapy, I've aced exams, I passed all my classes, etc. When I've been low on testosterone, I can't remember/memorize things, I do horrible in my classes, don't feel like I'm learning and have issues remembering things. 
 
 
 
 Easily gain ""flabby"" weight. I tend to gain about 20lbs when i'm not on testosterone, this is mainly around my waist/stomach. This is even when I eat very well. I also cannot gain any strength at the gym.  
 
 
 
 Erectile disfunction / low libido. My sex life with my partner is virtually non existent when I'm low on testosterone. Even when I do try, I cannot get an erection. 
 
 
 
 Foggy mind / a bit depressed. Not sure how to explain it, i tend to over think things and I'm not as cheerful when my testosterone is low. I tend to just go through the motions. 
 
 
 
 To top it off... I'm also infertile.","I was born with undescended testicles, surgery was performed to fix this, I lost one testicle, the other was salvaged but is very tender, after reviewing symptoms and blood work, I have low testosterone, though it's not low enough to be considered out of normal range. 
 
 In depth question: 
 Will insurance companies evaluate a patient's case in depth if requested? Taking into account previous history and  quality of life . 
 According to the lab reports I've gotten back multiple times, the ""normal"" range is 250-1100ng/dL. I'm within the lower end of the normal range. Which to the health insurance means I'm healthy. Physically and mentally, I don't feel well. 
 At 24 years old, I feel like I should not be on the lower end, if anything I should be on the higher level... at least 500 or 600. I'm actually at 406ng/dL. 
 According to [ this 1996 study ]( my levels are similar to those of a 85-100 year old man. 
 According to [ this other study ]( 95% of men my age had levels around 1005ng/dL. My actual levels represent about 5-10% of men my age. Even 95% of men 60 years old of age have levels more than twice as high as mine. 
 Is there anything I can do? Previously, I paid for Testosterone Cypionate prescribed from a GP out of pocket since my insurance didn't cover. 
 I ended up canceling the insurance since my only medical expenses were not covered by my insurance and I couldn't afford both. 
 When I moved away, I started paying for testosterone pellets out of pocket ($998 every ~5 months) from a hormone clinic. 
 Now that I have health insurance, I'd like to take advantage of it and get it to actually cover my medical expenses. I'm perfectly healthy aside from this issue.",24,M,healthcare

"Six years ago I was on vacation in Ireland. It was our third day there and we stayed at a bed and breakfast above a pub. My parents paid someone to carry our luggage upstairs. They were going to pay someone to bring it back down so I volunteered. I got the three huge rolling duffle bags down without a problem. The last piece was one of little roll alongs for under the plane seats. I went sailing down a flight of almost vertical, concrete steps. I landed on my elbow and twisted under on my wrist. One parent was loading the car, the other was eating in the next room and heard me fall and still didn't believe it was broken. Finally (almost 12hrs later) my arm looked like the Michelin man's so we went to the ER. They were able to tell my elbow was broken and something was wrong with my wrist so they sent me to a hand specialist and casted me until then. Three days later I met with a specialist who actually did his residency about 20mins away from where I live in NC. He said basically the same thing and to see someone when we got back to the states. I saw a general orthopedist but he didn't know so he sent me to a specialist. The first specialist looked at my wrist (my elbow had healed without a problem) and said ""she's a teenager, sometimes they get little pains or say they hurt because they want attention but I'll write you a prescription for occupational therapy (OT) anyway"". The therapist was baffled as to why my wrist was blowing up like a balloon whenever we tried to strengthen it. We told her which doc I was seeing (OT is in the doc office) and said ""he's an asshole. He's a typical surgeon who thinks he's god. You need to see the head of the practice"". After lots of politics to be able to see the new doc, I got to see him. (I shall refer to him as Dr. ) Dr. spent 6 months doing arthrograms, bone scans, nerve conduction tests, you name it before finally deciding he had to just go in and look around. A year and a half after my initial fall, I had exploratory surgery. I had a torn ligament that had folded back on itself so none of the scans were able to see it. I flew through recovery and rehab and was discharged. The pain returned about a year later though and we started the entire process over again. Last year Dr. went back in and found severe excess calcium had developed around where he had repaired the ligament. I still have been having severe pain so he went back in today and found TONS of scar tissue. Hopefully, this will take care of my wrist pain for good! But now I've got this damn finger to deal with.",Broke my elbow in Ireland 6yrs ago and screwed up my wrist. First surgery found a torn ligament.

"I've been dating this girl for a few months now and even though we aren't ""official"" (does that even mean anything nowadays?), we are exclusive. Today was a new low for us both as we discussed what we wanted from each other. 
 Background: She's been three years single before meeting me. No boyfriends or any serious dating. She was your typical single college girl in the sense that at the end of the day, she had no one to worry about but herself. 
 Me [24M], I'm a relationship guy and always have been. I know what and who I want and that's the end of it. 
 Today, while we were discussing some relationship issues, she straight up said ""I miss my friends"". It caught me so off guard because I never pressure her into seeing me. I'm fine on my own. She never tells me if she cancels on a friend to see me, so there I was, naive or oblivious to it all, thinking there was no problem when we got to see each other. 
 But I digress. In short, her friends are the ones still going out every weekend, clubbing and partying it up. They're good people and I've met a few. But that's what she wants to be doing too, all the while knowing I'm home completely 100% okay with her being out & getting drunk (I'm not, but I'm actively working on being okay with it). ""It's trust"" she says, ""my girlfriend goes out all the time, even more than I want to and her boyfriend doesn't care at all, because he trusts her!!"" 
 Don't get me wrong, I don't mind her going out with her friends but does she really have to get fucked up every time and neglect to let me know she's leaving the bar/club and that she's made it home? She tells me, ""I don't know what's going to happen, I don't plan things. If I get fucked up then I get fucked up and you should just trust me."" 
 I suppose what I'm trying to say is while I trust her FULLY, knowing she won't cheat on me and she won't do anything to endanger our relationship, I'm not comfortable with this ""single girl"" side of her that comes out when she's with her friends.  I just feel like now that's she's dating someone exclusively at this kind of level of respect and love, why can't she control herself when she's out? 
 But I digress yet again. So I asked her what her thoughts on having cake and eating it too and she said there's nothing wrong with that. She wants to be able to go party it up and not worry about me in any kind of way and have me to come home to at the end of the night. I get the vibe that she wants to act single with conditions (""Yeaa let's get fucked up, I'll flirt with you and you can buy me a drink but I am dating someone."" Yes, she more or less said this to me.) I just shook my head in disbelief. 
 My question(s): 
 1. Is her view on having the cake and eating it too a sign of relationship immaturity? Relationship immaturity as in she's not ready to be in a relationship? 
 2. What is normal in a healthy relationship? Can you or can you not have the cake and eat it too? 
 3. Am I over-thinking it all and should just let her do her thing? After all, I do trust her on issues like infidelity.

"I've been dating the same guy for 9 years, and last year I moved away from my family to live with him (2000 miles away). I am 25 and I think that he is my soulmate but there are some things that I am suspicious of.
The #1 thing that is bothering me He won't friend me on Facebook. When we originally started dating, he un-friended me because I was ""clingy"" (I'll admit I was). I was childish and he didn't want me posting ""cute things"" on his facebook wall. I've grown up a lot but he still won't friend me. 
 I should mention that he current has two Facebooks - one that he's had since High School (account #1) and one that he created after we moved away, which is the title of his contracting business (account #2). He won't friend-request me on ""account #1"" which is the one that uses his real name. When I asked why he wants two accounts, he said that he doesn't want his religious parents to see his old wall-posts including pictures of drinking and parties (which I think is understandable) but he also won't friend ME on that account 
 My concerns are that he's using his other facebook account to talk to his ex-girlfriend and doesn't want me snooping. 
 The part of this that I find really disrespectful is that he is still accepting friend-requests from other GIRLS, just not me. (I can see the ""recently added friends"" on the wall of his private account) 
 I also have a suspicion that the other account might say that he's single, but I have no way of knowing because he won't accept my friend request.

"I'd like to know about other people's experiences with their physicians, acquiring hormones and such. I'm currently 5 months on T-blockers and my doctor refuses to prescribe the estrogen part of my HRT yet. Originally my doctor and i went back and forth examining my mental & physical states through questionnaires, checkups and tests for about 6 months before prescribing my T-Blockers. She said that I didnt need a therapist because I had wanted this for SO long and also because i had a counsellor/trans mentor who was able to offer me help and support. 
 Well 5 months ago, the plan was to start me on Spiro and then add Estrogen 1-2 months in. On my 2nd month, I showed a little bit of hesitation to start Estrogen and I requested the doctor to push it by two weeks before I started estrogen because it was a big step and i felt the need to prep myself mentally and emotionally abit more. Two weeks later, I called my doctor, set up an appt to tell her that I was ready to start E. But she refused to prescribe the E when I saw her and asked me to wait another month to ""really make sure"" I was ready. Well it's been nearly 3 months since then and I still have not started Estrogen, and even joined a support group (my doctor refused to prescribe estrogen without me joining this group). I have another appt next week and I'm really hoping i can start estradiol. She seems to give me a new excuse every month on why I should wait another month. Last month, she asked me to do another general blood test (like my third time doing it in the past 11 mo.) to ""make sure"" my body was okay for estrogen. 
 I understand that my new doctor is inexperienced with trans-care and wants to be more cautious since there is a note of hesitation from a few months ago.

Women that he had never met and had no intention of meeting, as well as a woman he had a long-distance relationship with before we started dating (I will get back to her shortly, let's call her Sara.) Literally every woman in his life, besides me, he had showered with genuine, charming, gushy compliments. And even women that weren't in his life. Wtf. 
 I came to terms with this and (stupidly?) forgave him. I also worked on my self esteem a little bit. He improved in the compliments area but it never sounds genuine so tbh I cannot care less to hear them, it's always the same shit. I've given up in that department. I don't want to hear pre-rehearsed bullshit, all I wanted was the occasional ""you look nice"" or god forbid ""you look beautiful."" Bleh. 
 With my new-found self esteem comes the desire to post pictures of myself on the internet and bask in the glory of notes/likes/tweets/whatever. Two things happened out of this: 
 
 I started taking selfies. Not a lot. Not the amount that any of my friends take. Just a few. I came to this conclusion because I realized that I was 23 and owned LITERALLY  zero  pictures of myself. None. Whatsoever. I was asked to submit a photo for a group and had to take one because I had nothing.  His reaction?  The usual eye roll. Thinks it's unimportant. Thinks it's silly. Don't waste time on it. Thinks it's stupid, vain, etc etc. 
 
 I started taking more pictures of my body, sometimes clothed, usually not. Not posting them anywhere. His reaction was the same, except more ambivalent. Doesn't care. At all. 
 
 Since I wasn't getting a reaction from him (at all) I kind of wanted to post them for other people. Not on gone wild or something, but in more female-dominated spaces. His reaction? Doesn't want me to. Doesn't think it's respectful. 
 
 
 Now all of this would be fine and dandy if it was your boyfriend, or some random joe off the street. Completely reasonable reactions and nothing puzzling at all. 
 The problem is my fiance's personality. This would all make sense if he just genuinely didn't like the idea of social media or the idea selfies or the idea of nude pictures. But he LOVES them. Not just likes them in the way your average guy does, but LOVES them. The amount of time he has spent in the past both maintaining social media accounts, posting his own content, as well as going through other women's social media accounts/selfies/nudes is UNFATHOMABLE. Like. I can't describe it. The way he talks about other women who do post pictures of themselves online - especially ones that are nude - is so personable, respectful, unbelievable. I can't even describe it to you guys. 
 It makes me feel embarrassed and horrible tbh. How he spends long lengths of time liking pictures of other people's faces on twitter, or reblogging other people's nudes on tumblr, but for me he actively discourages and shames me for doing the same. It feels like such a horrible double standard. 
 The same goes for any sort of kinks. I figured this is long enough so I'll leave it as is. Only vanilla sex and missionary position here, despite him liking other things. It's not like I hide my interest in them. 
 It honestly makes me suspect that he's cheating, but I snooped through his entire PC (I know, bad, but honestly, reading all this, you wouldn't think he was?) and there was NOTHING incriminating on it. And he doesn't hide anything because we don't share passwords to each others phones/PCs but I got his, and there's nothing even remotely to suggest he's cheating. Watching fucked up porn? Yes. Messaging with people that are kind of promiscuous? Yes. Complimenting random women? But not cheating, not having emotional affairs, nothing. Everything (to me) is in the realms of 'acceptable.' So wtf.","Fiance actively encourages, motivates and befriends women who post sexually provocative pictures but doesn't want me doing the same, he's respectful to other people's selfies, but has called mine stupid and vain. He has his own kinks which very closely overlap with mine, but doesn't actually want to carry them out with me... but isn't cheating on me. Wtf",23,F,relationships
"Hi everyone. 
 So a bit of background info: My husband and I have been married for 3 happy years, are ""young"" parents to two wonderful boys (I'm 22, he's 23) and neither of us have really had to deal with the loss of a loved one before (the last deaths in both our families happened when we were both infants/toddlers)...

"Growing up, we always had dogs but I was never allowed have a cat because my mother hates them. I desperately wanted a kitten for years. One night, there was a litter of wild kittens hanging around outside my house. I waited around for hours to see would they hang around. Eventually I plucked up the courage to grab one. This kitten was the cutest animal I had ever seen. It was a fluffy white ball of love in my 12 year old eyes. I desperately snook it into the house, passed the sitting room where both my parents resided and quietly crept upstairs. I didn't want to keep the cat in my room so I put it in the guest bedroom. The guest bedroom is basically a room where my parents keep the most luxury items in the house. All of which happen to be white. I decided to let my sister in on my little secret and we both agreed that we would sleep in the guest room that night with the little creature. We fell asleep with the kitten in between us. 
During the night, I woke up to a sharp wetness at my feet. I quickly flicked on the light to find that the fluffy white ball of lurve had not just  pissed on the white sheets, but actually diarrheaed all over them and the white carpet too. It was everywhere. Now, anyone who's had the pleasure of smelling cat shit knows the pungence of it. The diarrora had  seeped through the sheets and onto my legs and the mattress. I actually dragged my younger sister out of the room. I braced myself as I went back in to look for Fluffyshitty. He was no where to be seen. I inspected the room to find ways of escape and realised that he must have escaped when I opened the door. I ran out of the room and down the stairs following a trail of shit into the sitting room where the cat had proudly placed himself on the coffee table. My mother and father stood there, mouths open, ironically, nearly shitting themselves too. The whole house was destroyed in stray cat shit. I was literally about 5 months scrubbing poo out of the carpet.

"My parents are from... out of state. More specifically, they're not from the States. They moved into the states a little over 22 years ago. Then, eventually, they gave birth to me. I was (and still am) their ""treasure,"" their ""world,"" their ""universe."" I am an adult now (young adult, to be exact), and they still tell me this because I am still their ""baby."" Well, my mom's ""baby"" and my dad's ""grown-up son."" 
 I grew up with parents that value my happiness over everything, and they endeavored to raise me to be an understanding person - someone who can understand other people's history, pains, emotions, lives, personalities, etc without prejudging them. I have to say, I am that kind of person, so I guess my parents achieved their goal there. However, growing up, they were so worried about my future, so they raised me to be a hard worker. Funny story: I'm not. See, my parents came into the states with nothing. My family was literally DIRT POOR. I remember a couple years back, when I sat down with my mom and talked with her after I had a huge fight with my dad, a quarrel that was instigated by my ignorance to the fact that my dad worked hard and still works harder than anyone I know, that our family, when I was just a little kid, made a little over 10k a year. My mom had a small job and my dad was jobless. When I was a kid, he would always leave home late at night (around 10PM-ish), telling me that he had to go to ""work"" and that he'd be back in 2 hours. As a kid, I was REALLY stuck to my parents - I didn't want to be separated from them, so those 2 hours my dad was away every day of the week felt like eternity. Little did I know, he wasn't going to work. He was looking for a job. Yes, he was job-searching everyday from 10PM-12AM and sometimes even longer (I slept at 9PM all the time as a kid, but our place was so small that I could hear him opening the door and coming into the house from my bedroom). I never really appreciated my parents until after that moment of realization - that my parents worked really and I mean REALLY freakin' hard to get to where we are now. Despite that, I would always fight with them whenever they wanted to hire a tutor or send me to cram school or even help me with anything, whether it be homework, making friends... anything. At one point, whenever the words ""homework,"" ""study,"" or ""test"" came out of their mouths, I would SNAP at them. I would scream at them without even giving them a chance to say anything, I would run to my room, and lock the door. Then, I would proceed to give them an attitude during dinner. This went on for years and years and years until the end of high school - until I hit college, which is where I am now. Now that I am an adult, I understand and appreciate them much more than I used to. I understand that they're hard-working, but the funny thing is, their jobs that they've been doing for so many years now... they're not jobs they enjoy. They even told me that. But then... ""why?"" I asked. Why would they work jobs that they don't enjoy? They've been doing this for YEARS; shouldn't they be burned out? Obviously, it was because of me. Their motivation to go through life every day is... me. I am the source of their happiness, the source of their reason for living - their raison d'etre (according to them). I know now how much they've worked for me. I know now how hard they've been fighting against their own demons... for me. They would always buy me the best clothes and shoes as a kid. Not to mention, a lot of toys, drawing kits, books, games, etc, and they would wear the same clothes for years until they were rendered into nothing more than rags. They would wear their shoes until they had holes in them. My parents would always joke about their tattered clothes and shoes full of holes, so, as a kid, I thought it was funny. But now... I understand everything. But I'm nothing like them. I'm not hard-working. I'm not motivated. I'm not necessarily the nicest person. I'm selfish. I'm... not the kind of son they wanted me to be. But, I'm trying to change. I'm trying to work hard now in college, but even then, I tend to get lazy a lot... recently, I've been thinking, ""have I failed my parents?"" I can't help but convince myself that I have - that I am a failure and although I know that they will always be happy for me and love me for who I am... I can't seem to love myself...

"Hey everybody, 
 Wherever you are, good morning or good afternoon. I hope you're all having a kick ass day. Thanks for reading my post. My name is Jacob and I want to give you a little background on me. Not really looking for attention just trying to explain where I'm coming from. 
 When I was 12 years old I would temporarily lose the ability to eat. It would come and go in periods where I just couldn't make myself swallow. My parents thought I was crazy and it took them a while to take me to the doctor. Well I went, and they had no idea what it was. I went to many doctors. I was put on liquid diets for months and months. 
 Eventually they decided I would need an endoscopy. Which is where they put you to sleep and put a camera down your throat and look into your esophagus. I didn't much understand the results then but they concluded that my esophagus happened to be a third of the width of the average person. So even when I could eat, a lot of the time the food would get stuck in my chest. Guys I've done some crazy shit in my time and gotten pretty hurt doing some stuff. But when the food gets stuck it hurts so fucking bad that I can't do anything. I start to drool, breathing gets hard, and it's incredible incredible pain. 
 So I continued to go to the doctor for years. It took them a long time to get a diagnosis. Lots and lots of endoscopies. I missed school all the time because I was in the hospital so much. They told me it was EE.(eosinophilic esophagitis) Basically allergies affect my eosinphil count causing the muscle in my esophagus to contract and get smaller. I'm allergic to quite a bit of stuff. And still now, 8 years later. I don't have an exact cause. They've tried to diagnose me with other conditions and lots of doctors have gone back and forth on what I really have.  I started having to get these risky procedures done where they would essentially put a balloon in my esophagus and fill it up with air every couple weeks to try and expand it to normal. 
 One time  when I was about 16 the balloon got a little too big.  It   tore my esophagus . From what they told me I started bleeding pretty bad and I had to get somebody else's blood pumped in me to fight it off. I stopped getting the procedures after that. 
 It got to the point when I was younger that I couldn't even finish a meal because food would get stuck and I'd have to make myself throw up to get it out. Every single meal. I lost a lot of weight. I was crazy skinny. I got made of for being skinny all the time. Bullied real bad in middle school and I know in high school I pushed a lot of people I cared about away just from all the stress. 
 Fast Forward 5 years  - I'm 17. I'm taking my first gravity bong hits in my parents garage with my best friends. I like it a lot. I start smoking regularly. Bud helped with other stuff. But I woke up one morning and realized food wasn't getting stuck anymore. I wasn't spending a couple hours every day in the bathroom. It just wasn't happening. EE just doesn't go away guys. They haven't found a cure. And I'm not 100% cannabis is the cure but I'm really positive that food stopped getting stuck in my chest 95% of the time and it's been the only real change in my life. 
 Fast forward 2 1/2 years.  - I'm 20 now. I live on my own. I work a job for the railroad I could easily make a career. I make good money and I have a good living. But I can't smoke anymore. My company drug tests. And the problems are coming back. Food is starting to get stuck again. I don't even want to go out with friends or girls because how can I make an excuse to sit in the bathroom for 30 minutes during a lunch/dinner date? The pain is coming back. 
 Today I'm doing a little better. The symptoms aren't fully back. I've gained a bunch of weight back, I'm living a healthy life. But I can't live with getting my condition all the back. I can't go back to how things were.
My eyes are watering and I'm trying not to scream. It feels like somebody shot me in the chest every single time and my only saving grace is illegal in my state for medical or recreational reasons.  I really want to get better, but this is gonna require a move. My condition is rare. I can't find any studies or anybody talking about bud helping them. Will a doctor believe me in another state? I'm only 20 so I guess I can't do it recreationaly. But I swear to you guys, this is chronic pain if chronic pain ever existed. Anyway, I'm just looking for help/advice about how I can make this happen. I can't talk to my parents about it because I got treated like a criminal when they found out I smoked. My mom threatened to call the cops all the time. My dad practically disowned me at one point. So I came to the best, chillest place for bud info. Thanks everybody.",Developed an awful rare condition when I was younger that stopped me from eating. Lived a shit painful childhood.

"20/F here. The guy is 26; not sure about his girlfriend (she's probably like 23). 
 This guy and I had gotten pretty close for a few months. It was to the point where we would see each other every day, I would sleepover, etc. He mentioned us being an official couple a few times, but I had just gotten out of a long relationship, so he said he wanted to give me some time. I thought things were hitting off well. I decided to tell him how much I liked him. A few days later, he told me that we probably shouldn't date because "" if we dated, something bad is bound to happen between us... and I wouldn't want to lose a good friend "". To me, that sounded like bullshit. But whatever. I was friend-zoned.  moved on. 
 It was probably about a couple weeks after he friend-zoned me that he got a girlfriend. We all worked together, so I would see them hold hands, kiss, and whatnot. I was internally bitter for a while, but then realized "" hey, I guess it wasn't meant to be "". Since he got a girlfriend, he and I stopped hanging out. No more late nights of DnD, guitar sessions, or movie outings. One day at work, he told me that he told his girlfriend about how we used to be close. I guess that was when this all started. She said since then, she hated when we talked. He also told me that she was jealous of me because he and I were perfect for each other. I didn't think much of it, seeing as how we rarely saw one another. I told him to assure her I had no plans of perusing him. 
 I quit the job and started doing my own thing. Not working together meant that I literally never saw him. We text casually, but that's about it (we've been preparing for a convention coming up soon, so we talk about costume ideas and whatnot). 
 This morning, I woke up to a text that said, ""My girlfriend just asked me not to be your friend anymore, so I'm probably about to be single"". It seemed so sudden to me. I have maybe said 3 words to the girl. She's cute and I have no grudges against her. He asked me if I had confronted her or said anything rude. I told him the truth, which was I didn't talk to her. I don't even have her on Facebook. I'm not a vengeful person. 
 Right now, my gut tells me to try and distance myself from this situation to prevent any more conflict. But that would mean losing a friend, which I don't think is fair. I'm a nerd; I have guy friends. Am I doing the right thing by staying out of this? Or should I try to intervene? Do I just need to let them sort this out on their own?","This guy and I used to be really close, but weren't officially dating. He friendzoned me. I moved on. He then got a girlfriend.

 EDIT  - I thank everyone for you input! It has really helped out. Back when we would hang out, he told me that he loved drama... so this could be amusing to him. I'm just standing back. He removed me from Facebook and said he would re-add me once he talked to his girl some more. I wish I could tell her I'm not interested in him at all, but again... I really don't want to interfere. 
 Also, to clarify a bit, I was ready for a relationship. I was completely and utterly detached from my ex. I had made sure to distance myself from him slowly while we were still together. This guy was just being courteous and wanted to give me some time. I suppose when that time came, he was no longer interested.",20,F,relationships
"As a quick aside: if the circumstances were any different, I'd probably preface this post with your standard ""I know that I'm in the wrong, there's no need for name calling, etc."" but I think that some proper shaming might do me some good. Even just typing this story out makes me feel sick. 
 I've known P since my freshman year of high school. We're both 25 years old. He is undoubtedly one of the closest friends that I've ever made. About three months ago, P introduced us to his girlfriend, B. If I'm remembering correctly, the two of them had met six months earlier and had been dating for three of those months (might only be one). I was blown away by her. B was beautiful, funny, caring, etc. We ""hit it off"" the night that we met. I was both genuinely happy for my friend and very saddened that he had met her first. 
 I saw B on several occasions over the next several weeks and was thrilled when I did. She attempted to talk to me over facebook during this time, but I ignored her messages or gave her one word answers, as I didn't want my friend to think that I was at all interested in her. B developed a friendship with my FWB, mentioned that she thought I was cute, and asked a lot of questions about me. Some of this stuff was pretty nosy, especially after B learned that her new friend and I were sleeping together. 
 About two months ago, B broke up with P. He was pretty upset by it. I felt badly that she had hurt him, badly enough that I pushed away any thoughts of being with her. My FWB told me that B also felt badly about it, though probably less so than P. A few weeks after the breakup, P was meeting with and hooking up with other girls. I didn’t have any contact with B during this time, and anything I heard about her was through my FWB. 
 Two weeks ago, my FWB told me that B would be couch surfing the following week. I purposefully spent the night on Thursday, when I knew B would be over. I feel like a pig for what happened next. I genuinely was not planning on having sex with my FWB that night, but she initiated. I was literally having sex while fantasizing about the girl in the next room. 
 My FWB left for work the following morning. She trusted me enough to close the windows, lock the door, etc. so that B and I could sleep in for an extra hour. I woke up to B sitting next to me and hitting me in the stomach playfully. I sat up and we spoke for a few minutes. I asked her if she was okay, as she had seen P on Thursday and had spoken to FWB that night. I had heard them speaking in the living room while I was in the bedroom. She said that she was mostly okay. I showered and we left FWB’s apartment. 
 We walked to the train together. I’ve run through this scenario a hundred times over the past few days and I cannot for the life of me explain what prompted this. We reached the platform and I put my arms around her to try to give her a comforting hug. I leaned in to kiss her on the cheek and before I knew it we were kissing. I realized what I had done and stepped away, but she pulled me back towards her. We kissed a few more times while waiting for the train, we held hands as we walked, and I kissed her goodbye. 
 Since then I’ve spoken to her nearly nonstop. We’ve discussed the implications of what happened several times. 
 Some choice quotes: 
 B: “You know that I wouldn’t be just a casual just for fun hookup though right? That’s not me, I get too invested for that.” 
 Me: “I know. But the thought of that doesn’t quite scare me off.” 
 B: “I thought that’s the last thing you wanted.” 
 Me: “I don’t know what I want. I feel like we click, though. At least a little. Don’t you?” 
 B: “Always have.” 
 Me: “You always have felt that?” 
 B: “We have more in common than me and P ever did.” 
 …… 
 On the two of them ruining their friendship: 
 B: “We never should’ve dated. It’s such a shame.” 
 ……. 
 Me: “Do you feel like what I did yesterday felt kind of “right?” "" 
 B: “The only things I feel bad about in regards to it is that a person we care about could get hurt.” 
 Me: “That’s exactly what I think.” 
 B: “Do you wish you hadn’t?” 
 Me: “No. I wish that I regretted it. But I don’t.” 
 ……. 
 Me: “It just felt natural yesterday morning.” 
 B: “Doesn’t it bother you at all though?” 
 Me: “It bothers me that it would hurt P if he knew. I don’t regret kissing you. It felt right in that moment.” 
 B: “I know.” 
 Me: “Is that an ‘I know you feel that way’ I know, or an ‘I agree that it felt right’ I know?” 
 B: “It’s an ‘I’m a stupid idiot because I actually wanted it and didn’t think’ I know. It’s an ‘even though I liked it I should’ve stopped it’ I know.” 
 ….. 
 On Saturday night I told my friend nothing more than that B had asked me to hang out next week. The two of us were both pretty drunk. I asked P if he would be okay with me seeing her, and he said “you have my blessing.” He also said “talk to me tomorrow.” Yesterday’s “talk to me tomorrow” conversation consisted of: “You know what I’m gonna say, man. I would really prefer you do not have any romantic relations with B.” I told him “Okay, that settles it then” and he thanked me. 
 P's roommate of four years has been dating another one of P's exes for the past two years. While the two of us were intoxicated, he mentioned this in an ""I've already had experience with this"" kind of way, but in our sober conversation, he framed it in an ""I've already got this on my mind"" kind of way. 
 P and B's Thursday encounter was a fluke due to the presence of a mutual friend. To my knowledge, they have not spent time together on any other occasion since the breakup. 
 I called up B and told her that P had since changed his mind. I asked her what she wanted to do. She said that she wants to wait and ask P again in the future. I have no idea if he’d ever be okay with the two of us dating, but I’m more than willing to wait. The next time she’d be in town would be October, so it’s not as though there’d be anything physical in the short term. B and I agreed to stay in touch until then. I plan on talking to her tonight. Not about anything serious, though. Just friendly conversation. 
 I struggle to put into words the passion in that kiss. Subconsciously or not, it was something that the two of us had wanted since the night we met. I know how crazy this makes me sound, and I know that I’m relatively young. But I'm not some stupid teenager. I'm an adult and despite knowing that I’ve betrayed someone close to me, I know how that kiss made me feel. I know that my friend would be furious if he knew that I had kissed her. I feel that he would understand, though, if he could somehow have swapped places with me and experienced how right it felt. 
 So what should I do? Which one of us is being selfish?",I am a shitty person who kissed my friend’s ex. He has no idea. I asked him for permission to accept her invitation to hang out next week. He said no. I don’t know what to do.,25,M,AskMen
"Long time lurker here, thowaway for obvious reasons. Wife (27F) and I (33M) have been open to the idea of poly for a while. A big concern for us is the fact that we have HPV and I have HSV2.

"Okay, so I first moved into my apartment in about August of last year. About 5 days into my lease I threw a cigarette into some boxes which my roommates and I had set out on the porch.

 I found a spot next to the road. My idea was to sit there in this 8-10 foot long path between road and cornfield, and watch the sunset. Until  Iwas extremely interrupted. 
 She came out of nowhere. I looked to my right, and see a bright red pick up truck pull off the road into the grass right next to where I was sitting. I started apologzing, thinkingshe was the farmland owner about to be pissed. 
 It was an older, hard gal in her late forties. Deep, gravelly voice from years of cigarettes and beer. Lookin' like she belonged on a Harley, and she was staring me down. 
 After a few moments, she squints her eyes at me and says ""Are you safe?"" I ask her what she means. She says ""Are you okay? You're sittin' by the side the road, just sittin' here, and it got me worried."" At this point, I realized she thought I was going to jump under a car. ""No I'm okay"" I tell her. ""Seriously"", she insists, ""Are you okay? Can I help in any way? Do you live here, you need a ride?"" Me ,"" No ma'am, I'm okay, I likve a few blocks down."" ""Oh. Well, alright, I guess... You need somewhere to stay?"" 
 At this last question, I started choking up. I had no one to share my eelings with, I was deep in (very real) depression, I obsessed about my death and how to do it and where and why (I've always been a coward about it, though). No one knew how much I hurt. And this rough old bird broke me down in a matter of words. After finally convincing her I was okay, she continued down the road, never to be seen again. As soon as she left, I called an old friend who sort of understood, and sobbed, telling her what happened.","angsty, hurting, 17 year old spacepuppy recieves hope.

"So I am a 29 HL male with a 28 LL wife.  Been together for 13yrs married for 9.5 We just had kid #2, why...? I have no idea, probably stupidity on my part, thinking things would get better.  She has been LL for years now, but more so over the past ~4 years. The kids are 2.5 yrs and 3 weeks.  I know that kids can really dampen a woman's libido, but any kind of intimacy (non sexual touching, kissing etc) has been non existent for quite some time now even before the kids (except for the obligatory peck goodbye).  I have always had to initiate, she has never really shown any interest and she has always needed help in the lubricant dept.  basically it has made me feel like she isn't attracted to me, and the lack of enthusiasm during our few sexual encounters has felt like I was fucking a mannequin/dead fish and it only reinforced my perception of how she feels about me. 
 She says she is attracted to me and loves yet over the past year or two all I ever seem to hear from her are things about me that repulse her.  She can't seem to comprehend the idea of ""if you don't have anything nice to say..."".  I can understand wanting to tell someone of a flaw if it might be embarrassing in public, all I'm asking for is some tact or stfu.  We sleep in separate beds, because 1; we aren't intimate. And 2; she says I snore. We haven't shared a bed in any capacity for a few months now. 
 I'm a pretty good looking guy, I'm quite fit, still have my hair and I stay well groomed, yet she shows no interest.  I have pretty much given up on initiating because it seems more naggy especially when I know the answer already.  I don't expect her to be ready to go after just having a kid, however just showing some kind of affection would be appreciated.  The most frustrating thing is when she masturbates when I am at work or school and then tells me about it as if only to rub it in my face, because she won't want sex later.  I've told her to not even tell me about it anymore as it just makes me mad. 
 Even before the kids the excuses were the same: maybe later, you should of asked earlier, too tired, not in mood,headache, headache, etc.  and forget about foreplay, she always just wants to get it over with, with an impersonal quickie. Even trying to give her a bj is often a no go.  For the past few years She has told me that she doesn't want to be intimate because she feels too self conscious, which blows my mind since we have been together so long. I tell her how attractive I think she is throughout the day not just to get sex. Apparently it doesn't help her confidence. 
 Besides her intimacy issues she is great, however, I feel that I am reaching my wits end with this relationship.  I need intimacy, I want a partner that desires me, right now we feel more like roommates than a married couple.  Unfortunately the situation is complicated by our children, I love them and I am conflicted on what to do. If we divorce it is likely that she will move out of state and I will not see the kids very often.  Extended family will see me as the asshole, and its possible I will still be alone, and still be jerking it to porn.  Not to mention that I will likely be paying her a decent chunk of my income for child support. Or option 2 is I stick it out for the kids, but then they grow up observing a dysfunctional relationship and think it's normal, and I am unhappy for the remainder of the marriage. However I get to see the kids grow up, and I don't have a child support payment. 
 We have had ""the talk"" several times and it doesn't seem to do any good.  We have seen a counselor for martial issues, with no positive changes. I've done the chore-play game (several times) with no results.  As it stands now I am leaning towards giving her the ultimatum come New Years after family is done visiting.  I'm planning on asking for an open marriage or some tangible solution to the problem versus ""I'll try and be better"".  Shouldn't the desire to be intimate just come naturally? IMO if it's forced its no longer a desire. 
 Any recommendations on what to do are welcomed. 
 Edit:it's not just a lack of sex, I completely understand her not wanting to have sex right now and that's not what my post was entirely about. I knew posting this would make it sound like I was asking for sex right now, and I'm not. What I'm asking for is someone that is attracted to me, and desires me, and not being someones whipping boy/roommate. What I just don't understand is how there seems to be a complete lack of attraction. Intercourse isn't the only way to show your desire for someone. Even if she were to just give me a serious kiss that would be something, but the last few times I tried to give her a real kiss she literally laughed at me. There is no touching coming from her and hasn't been for a while, I have always had to initiate. Which has felt like I am touching nothing more than a ""real doll"".","married with 2 young kids, non-intimate marriage.

"I sold a digital camera to an old man that wanted to use it to photograph some of the things that he owns. He contacted me a few days later and asked me to show him how to use the camera. He seemed nice enough, and like he wouldn't rape me, so I went to his apartment to show him what's up. 
 I figure that he is about 70-80 years old (was in WWII). He lives by himself (never married, only a couple secondary family members in the area) in a condo, and is an art collector. In fact, he is an a-lot-of-things collector. Mostly trinkets and jewelry and vases and that sort of thing. I think he figures that he is going to croak soon and wants to keep a record of all of the things he has cllected for one reason or another. He seems like he is on okay shape for his age, he can get around (very slowly), and can lift heavyish objects and has good dexterity, can climb stools, etc, and his mind is still pretty sharp. 
 His condo is nice, but it is very messy. Not dirty, really, just messy. Seems like he's gotten into the habit of not putting things away when he makes food, plastic bags and mail all over the floor and so on. We make some small talk about his place and how long he's been in town and such, and I start showing him how to use the camera. After a little while it becomes clear that there is no way he is going to be able to use the camera to take pictures of dozens (hundreds?) of his trinkets by himself, let alone, figure out how to use the camera or press its tiny buttons. So I offer to come over every week or so and help him catalog his shit. He pays me for my time and an arrangement is made. 
 I went for the second time tonight and spent a couple of hours going through stuff together. We made some small talk (he's got a pretty keen sense of humor, and many good stories) and I oogled some of his collection. Anyway, one of the first things I said to him was how nice his place is, and he said ""yeah, I like it, but I have to take the bus, and it's awful lonely."" And I figure that this guy doesn't really have anybody, it's a pain in the ass for him to leave, he's slowing down,,, -- I want to try to give this guy some good company. 
 Tonight he tried to give me money and I declined, this time at least, as a gesture of good faith (although I don't have a problem with him paying me for my time while I help him). I also offered to help him clean up and organize, which seems like it would be hard for him to do in his physical condition. But I'd also like to reach out to him, so to say, with simple gestures. I don't know, make him food or something? Bring him something? And I realize that I have no idea what I could give him or do for him (other than help out around the house) that he would get enjoyment out of. Furthermore, I don't want to bother him if he's not into it. I understand that some old folks just want to be left alone, or otherwise don't want people messing about their lifestyle/apartment/routine/whatever, no matter how so. 
 So, does anyone have any advice on what I can do (and how I tactfully do it) to help brighten this fellow's life?","Recently befriended an old man (70-80). He lives alone, has fairly limited mobility, and seems lonely. What can I do for him to brighten his days?",75,M,AskReddit
"Hello there! It's been a while since I've last visited this site, but over the holidays I was frequenting ExNoContact like crazy after my boyfriend [21M] ended things--my first heartbreak, and one following a very intense relationship. Once I got back to school, I found out I was in a class with him, but despite seeing him twice a week I was moving on and becoming very happy living a single life for the first time since I was 15. We remained civil-to-friendly, but didn't talk about anything going on in our lives. About two months ago I also started seeing a new man, which has been great. 
 Because my breakup with my ex was relatively amicable, although painful, he stayed friends with my best friend who I'll call J. J always told me when he was hanging out with my ex if it came up, and I appreciated his honesty. But recently he's started bringing my ex's name up in conversation pretty often, unprompted, and has been giving more and more details about what they've been doing. This has started to annoy me just a little bit, but I'm not really sure why. I'm over my ex to the extent that I realize he's not the person I thought he was, and don't really want to see him or think about him at all. I guess it annoys me that J has started talking about him more because that chapter of my life finally felt over and now J's bringing it back to my memory. 
 But today, J talked the most about seeing my ex than before, by a large margin. He discussed every activity they'd done hanging out, but then dropped some pretty crazy news. My ex moved out of his apartment back with his parents, and is letting his friends live in his apartment instead. His depression, which has been a life-long struggle for him and reappeared towards the end of our relationship, has gotten worse. And to top it off, he bought a bunch of acid, and is probably going to do it with his friends. (Nothing against acid, but he's clinically depressed and pretty self-destructive.) 
 I didn't know what to say to J when he told me all of this, and so I didn't say anything at all. But it's really worrying me. After a few months of not knowing at all the details of my ex's life, I get a window into it for the first time and it's pretty upsetting. I was finally not thinking about him as much, but now I can't stop--I don't even want to reach out to him or anything, it's just devastating me that I don't think he'll ever be happy. 
 I would really really love some advice--I don't know why J is starting to bring up my ex so much, especially to tell me something like this. Is there anything I can say to him? And I don't know how to process this new troubling information about my ex, who I also see in class regularly.

"As the title says, I(17) had a summer relationship with this girl(18) and things ended last week because she had to go to college and I had to stay for one more year of high school. 
 Backstory:
Jen(18) was a girl ive always liked and really looked up to her as a friend.  Ive liked and pursued her twice and we decided to date towards the end of the school year.  The problem was that she was a senior and would soon be going to college and I had to stay in our home town and do one more year of high school.  She is going to college 5 hours away so there is no possibility of us continuing so at the beginning of it we agreed to break off at the end. 
 Me and Jen both quickly fell in love, or what I think was love.  We did everything together. We ate ice cream, went to concerts. We went on 5 hour car rides to different states and stayed in a friends lake house.  We visited water falls and toured natural parks.  I had the time of my life with her. 
 Well last week was my last day with her.  It was filled with ice cream and tears.  We never really talked specifically on what was going to happen while she was in college but she said that she wanted to stay in touch.  She said that writing each other letters would be fun and to send each other cute cards and stuff. (She loves little card stores and witty and cute holiday cards such).  I talked about going no contact for alittle while would be good for me.  She was confused about that and thought that that wouldnt be good.  She wanted to keep contact. I havnt talked to her really since. 
 Well its been a week and i was not ready for this.  We had about a 150 snapchat streak but i had to delete her off it because of the snap chats she was sending. She was constantly with boys and she called them babe and sometimes they wouldnt be wearing a shirt and stuff like that. It really bothered me. 
 Now my question is what should I do? I know that really isnt anything i can do of sorts but should I bother to try to comunicate to her? I know its only been a week but whens a good time? A few more weeks? A month? 
 I understand that she is in a totally new setting and is currently starting a new life sort to say in college.  Am I just a lost cause?  Do you think she could of forgotten about me and gotten over me so quick?

"Damn, man. Reminds me of a date I had off the ol' Craigslist:
So I met this girl on Craigslist, and after a few phone conversations we decided to meet. She seemed legit (not in retrospect), until she asked me to meet her behind a K-Mart in a dark alley at 11:00 P.M in one of the seedier areas in my mini-metropolis. So some hippie left his beat up Datsun truck at my house so i drove the piece of shit to meet this girl, but not without taking the precaution of taking a metal t-ball bat, knife, and pepper spray with me. For a date. Anyway, after some sketchy preliminaries she gets in the truck and eventually we start making out after she does and says several things that would make anyone else drive the fuck away. So some car comes up and turns out it's her mom yelling for her to get out. She was 19 and i was 24 so i thought that was why, but after an awkward exit she texted me and said, and i quote: ""My sister just died :("" I said sorry, and then she started calling me from blocked numbers for 3 weeks, crazy shit.

"All these stories about how badass we were when we were kids, one can't help but to wonder where it goes over the years. 
 Anyways, my badass childhood moment took place when I was 8 or 9. I had a couple friends who were brothers and they lived down the street from me. Almost daily I would drop by and we'd roughhouse for hours playing football, playing nutcheck, wrestling on their trampoline, you get the idea, manly stuff. 
 On this particular day, a couple of their cousins came over and we all decided to mess around on the trampoline. At some point they decided we should all wrestle and divide into teams, black peoples vs. white peoples. I was the only white guy. I eagerly took on their challenge and quickly found myself laid out when I was drop kicked and then body slammed until I snapped and roared with my powerful young voice for them to get off me. 
 One of the cousins laid down on the trampoline in front of me, looked me straight in my teary, rage filled eyes, and said "" Are you okay man ?"" So I huffed, I puffed, and I took two fingers and poked him in the eyes, turning him into a screaming, crying mess of pain. One cousin down, one more cousin and two brothers to go. I shambled to my feet and took each of them and threw them into each other or on top of the cousin with the poked out eyes. The drop-kicking, throwing, and screaming in pain (for one of them at least) continued until we were all exhausted. After checking to see that Cousin Eye Poke was okay (his eyes were pretty red from the poke and the crying but he was fine) I went home laughing like a maniac as I recalled the eye poking over and over.","Manly play time turns into a racial beat down.

"So this weekend I went down to Bourbon street in New Orleans for my fraternity formal. I currently use a KF ONC, was hoping to try out my new NG21 TX ID's but I didn't get the chance to because he doesn't know what an ETA or overnight shipping is. Anyways back to the story, Bourbon street bars and bouncers are EXTREMELY strict when it comes to IDs in general, and we rented out a bar for our formal, so everyone in my fraternity thought they wouldn't be so strict since we rented their place out. One of my brothers (age 20) goes up to the bouncer with a TED OH, gets denied within 30 seconds sent outside, another one of my brothers (age 20, looks old too) uses a DJ TX and the bouncer looked for over a minute and then denied him, neither ID was taken.

"I know this is stupid, and I'm sure you'll all tell me to unfriend or untag her and move on   I just wanted to vent and hopefully one of you will be kind enough to explain emotions to me like I'm 5. 
 A year-long relationship ended a few weeks ago and I [27m] just realized that my ex[25f] has untagged herself from photos in which we appeared together.  I understand that this is a normal and healthy thing for her to do to get on with her life, however she has  not  untagged herself from solo-shots or closeups that appear in my albums. 
 Vent-mode :  This drives me crazy -She doesn't want proof\reminders of our past relationship (fair play, we're not together), but it would appear to me (in my potentially irrational state) that she wants to use  MY  single photos of her to bolster her social status.  I know it's no longer any of my business what she does or how she does it, but it just really bothers me that she would have the nerve to pick and choose between wanting to distance herself from our relationship, but still appear in my photos.   She even asked for  pics of our last date together shortly before we broke up, then used them as profile pictures for facebook AND her  current dating profile .  It's a huge slap in the face. 
 I really wanted to let things be and just go our separate ways -- let our pictures remain, as a kind of testament to past experiences and memory, and just move on.   I just can't help but see this as her ""using me"" by removing traces of our relationship, but keeping the pictures I took of just her. Am I reading too much into things? 
 Where I'm at: 
 
 Ego mode 
 
 Still obviously reeling from the breakup 
 
 bothered by her apparent opportunism 
 
 Hurt by her disinterest in keeping\treasuring our past memories, and instead just adding her participation to the collection of shit she's done. 
 
 
 I realize that last bullet is pretty idealistic, but that's how I feel right now. 
 I know it's late and I am reacting rather badly to this, but I'd appreciate if someone could  patiently  explain how I should interpret and deal with this.  I removed one album in protest, but I don't want to sanitize our time together out of spite. 
 I don't have any delusions of wanting to get back together, but part of me would really like for us to be friends at some point in the future.  Seeing her do this makes me feel like my pictures of us mean nothing more to her than an opportunity for showmanship or preening for someone else.  Maybe I'm overreacting, or maybe it doesn't matter how I interpret it. 
 I'd appreciate any advice on how I  should  approach this.  Should I take the high road and ignore it?  Unfriend her?  Untag her from my photos she's opted to keep?  I desperately want to take the high road in this and not get sucked down into doing immature and petty things, but my feelings are majorly hurt right now.","Ex has de-tagged herself from FB photos where we appear together, but kept my pics of just her.

"I [M23] Have recently lost complete contact with my circle of close friends. We used to hang out every single weekend,  they would either text/ call and always try to include me.  Lately,  and by lately I mean these past 2 months,  I have been pushed out of my circle of friends (it is a group of 4 including myself.)

"As I began typing this, I realized it was turning into a wall of text. My apologies. 
 My first request- don't let my age be off putting. I'm not your typical 19 year old. I've been challenged on that several times before, but nobody has challenged it once they have gotten to know me. All I ask? Give me a chance. 
 My ideal age range is 18-25/26. But hey, I'm always down to talk to people. 
 Distance doesn't bother me, although places like Australia may be difficult to work, I'm always opening to trying. 
 Viable candidates should have the following: 
 -Quick wit and intelligence 
 -Ambition/passion for something in life. You don't need to want to climb the corporate latter. You just need to love something and be willing to share it with me. 
 -A sense of adventure- why? Because it's more fun. Will we go on many adventures? Probably not. But a girl can dream, and open mindedness, flexibility, and spontaneity are all great things. 
 -At least some level of physical fitness- I'm not saying you need to be a gym rat or anything. I'm certainly not. But I love the idea of someone who can play volleyball with me (more on that later), or go hiking, generally takes care of themselves. 
 -Ideally, you would include a picture in your message to me. I don't want to sound shallow, but attraction is an undeniable part of any relationship. I will be more than willing to send one in return, so long as what you send me is SFW. 
 Bonus points are assigned for the following: 
 -Red headedness- I have no explanation. I just love gingers. 
 -Accents- You can make silly attempts at them too. That can count. 
 -Musicality (more on that later) 
 -Being really athletic 
 A little about me: 
 I'm in school studying publishing and audio engineering. Both are very behind the scenes areas, but that's part of what I love about it. Taking the creative work of the artist, the author, and actually turning it into something that others can enjoy. I've yet to dive into the publishing side of it, but I love what I'm doing so far in audio. It's like a big puzzle. You know that you can make it sound better (not talking about autotune and actually changing things like that, nothing more dramatic than EQing, compressing, etc), and there are a thousand ways it can be done. It's like a puzzle with multiple ways to be put together, and no one answer is right in the end. It's great fun. 
 As kind of side note from that, I am fairly musical. I sing and play guitar, but I also played flute/piccolo for 7 years and have dabbled a bit with piano and cello. I love getting swept up in music. There are these moments where everything else fades away, and it just kind of consumes you. It's like breathing. I can't explain it. But if that's what it's like being high, I understand how people get addicted. 
 I'm also a competitive volleyball coach. The season is almost over, with the last tournament being this weekend, but it's something I really love most days. I've got the third string of 14 year olds. Most of the time, they don't have an ego and are willing to work their butts off for you. I've set the precedent that I am the authority, and will snap them in line any time I need to, but because I'm really not that much older than them, we almost have a weird sibling relationship. We can joke around and poke fun at each other, but there is still a ton of respect. Usually. Some times they act like 14 year old girls, but it's not very often, and I deal with it as bluntly as I can. Kids, right? 
 That's a little bit of a look into main parts of my life. Of course, Netflix is my stand is boyfriend at the moment. We spend many a night all cozied up in bed watching House of Cards (I freaking love House of Cards), Mad Men, X Files, the occasional competitive cooking show to cleanse the palette. 
 I am Christian, and my faith is important to me. I went on a month long mission trip to Guatemala last summer, and will be taking another trip to Mongolia this summer.","I think I'm an interesting person, and if you think we would click, please message me!",19,F,r4r
"I'm only 19 years old, but I'm not in school at the moment. I'm training to work at my family's software business and have been ever since I was 16. It's fulfilling work, but I've been starting to feel lonely. 
 I had always been a loner in school. My only peer relationship was with a girl who approached me because she felt that I was lonely. I wasn't, or at least I convinced myself that I was not. However, now, three years after last speaking to her, I actually found myself feeling lonely. She was the only person I had to reach out to, so I messaged her, asking if she wanted to meet again. 
 When she agreed, I was so very happy. The forlorn feeling was gone completely. I imagined I had solved my problem and could get back to work full-heartedly. She said she'd tell me when she has time towards the end of the week and generally seemed quite pleased. 
 When she didn't get back to me I was pessimistic. I was sure that she just didn't want to say no outright and that she never wanted to meet in the first place. On the weekend I wanted to know for sure, and sent her a joking message saying something to the effect of: ""You know, if you didn't want to meet up with me, you could have just said so :P"". 
 To my surprise, her response was ""noooo... I'm just getting flooded with school work."" We scheduled a day on which to meet. I was as happy as I had been when she accepted my first invitation,  and there was no trace of her doing it just to be nice. However, there was this creeping feeling that after we met it would be over again, and I'd have just freshly lost my last peer. 
 We met. She did most of the conversation driving (for which I felt a bit guilty), but I enjoyed hanging out with her. When we said goodbye she told me to message her sometime. My inter-personal pessimism had returned almost within 2 days of the meetup. The few conversations became shorter and shorter (her responses more so), and I was always the one to initiate it. 
 I only messaged her about once a week because I didn't want to be annoying in case that she was just being nice, but I also knew that my pessimism had been misplaced before, so I didn't want to just end it. 
 Truthfully, I do not like chatting over facebook very much. I find it too impersonal even though I'm a somewhat smoother conversationalist in text form. 
 Anyway... I wanted to meet her every so often (not too often... she has other friends and I didn't want to be a pest), so I was planning on asking her if she wanted to meet up again. I was going to... but then I found she had gotten a boyfriend. 
 I had been unsure if my feelings for her were romantic, but seeing her with someone else evoked a feeling of ""well, it's time to move on."" I feel (perhaps irrationally) that she senses that I have feelings for her, and that she surely doesn't want to keep in touch for that reason at least. Maybe I'm boring as well... the only things I seem to be able to talk about are work related, and though she plans on pursuing her studies in the same general field, I think our interests in it are a bit too far apart. 
 At this point, in addition to not being sure if she wants it, I'm unsure if it would be smart to try being friends with her, given that I seem to have different feelings for her. 
 I don't want her to chat with me because she's nice, and grow resentful. I've been on the other side of that with a different girl that I met under similar circumstances in high-school, and I know how easy it is to pretend to enjoy talking to someone (I feel guilty about that). I would feel pathetic in that situation, and I would almost prefer cutting ties to even risking being put in such a position - I find it utterly humiliating. 
 So, I still feel I'm burning out if I just work all day, and I think I need someone to unwind with every once in a while. Some part of me still wants to remain friends with this girl, but my uncertainty as to what she thinks of this, as well as my doubts on whether it's wise to continue a friendship, having romantic feelings for the other person, is a strong counterweight. It might not be good for me, and it might be weird for her. 
 If I should not attempt to continue this bud of a friendship, what else should I do about my sudden onset of loneliness. I guess I could go out and meet new people, but I'm not sure how I would do that. In school, it's relatively easy - you're all there for the day, and you all have that in common. It's quite natural to start new friendships. However, in the real world I have absolutely no idea how to go about it. Not only that, but I don't feel particularly inclined to do it. I feel like this girl and I have ""history"" (scarce as it may be), and I feel attached to her in a way I don't see myself getting attached to someone else. Filling the void with some new stranger seems very strange to me, and I can't really picture or look forward to it. 
 Maybe I should get over it, and try to meet someone when I'm less desperate for it? 
 I notice that this got quite specific, and if the girl read this (which is very unlikely, I know), she would know that it was about her. Just for the sake of peace of mind I'll address myself to her here: 
 ""In the extremely unlikely event that you're reading this, I hope you find this at least amusing instead of weird. ;)  "" 
 Also, sorry for the comma placement. I just sort of sprinkle them around, I'm not sure what I'm doing. Maybe I can blame it on not being a native English speaker, but I kind of doubt that. 
 Anyway, thanks is you read all that. Just writting about this helped clear up my mind a bit.","The hardest part of this post is to condense it... every part of it just seems to significant to me. Here goes:
Due to suddenly feeling lonely, I reconnected with a girl whom I hadn't been in contact with for 3 years. We met. I'm unsure if she wants to continue the friendship. She just got a boyfriend, and I think I found that I have feelings for her... so there's another reason against continuing this. However, I still feel lonely. Should I get over it, try to meet new people, or try being friends with her?",19,M,relationships
"When I was in high school I had the biggest crush on this literal girl next door. She had a horrible back-door way of rejecting me (that took years) and it really hurt. When I wasn't interested in her in that way anymore she seemed to be over me too because she didn't have ultimate power over me anymore. 
 When I went to college I wanted everything to change. I wanted to stop giving a fuck about everything. No attachment to any idea, object, person, etc. I wanted to be what I would have considered to be the coolest guy ever to a 15 year old. I became this weird mix of The Dude and Tyler Durden (or so I thought). I was pretty much always stoned and always said what I thought. I had this image and reputation as a guy who didn't give a fuck and people from all over the unit would come to my dorm for ""therapy sessions"" as we smoked and talked about the absurdity of life while listening to music and watching stupid youtube videos. I was super anti-conformist and anti-authority. If I wanted to do something, I did it, and if I didn't want to, I didn't do it. I was literally referred to as a ""mench"" (which I still think is a lofty claim). 
 Well, it all kind of caught up with me eventually. It was coming to the end of the first semester and I hadn't done shit. I thought I would have been able to pull it all off last minute because I had a shit ton of adderall. I found that taking a lot of adderall felt really good and just started experimenting with smoking and snorting adderall. I thought that I was finding the answers to the universe by doing so. Turns out, there is something called ""amphetamine psychosis,"" and adderall is an amphetamine. I became incredibly paranoid and delusional. Everyone was out to get me. Everything became some weird metaphor. Everything was ""one"" and it scared the shit out of me. Long story short, in this state I babbled to my residential director and she called cops and an ambulance to pick me up for a little check up (needless to say, the cops were scary as fuck. Not intentionally of course). 
 So, I thought I was in some 1984 Ministry of Love kind of places because I was in a hippy hospital for a mandatory 72 hours. I missed finals and got a medical withdrawal so it was like the semester didn't happen. I had to take a break from the university and go to community college for a semester to show that I could still function in society. Even after the hospital, I was still loopy for months and I knew it. Since then, I gave A LOT of fucks. I became extremely self conscious, either too anxious or too depressed to function. 
 The next semester I came back to the university but it was different. I didn't want to contact the people who saw me all crazy. I kept quiet and kept mostly to myself. I would pop in and out of my self-impossed box, but I was in it for the most part. All people knew about what happened were rumors (like that I did PCP) and I gave up on correcting them. 
 It's a year later now and a decent amount of things has changed. I'm a 21 year old middle class white guy at college and I don't really have time for this existential crisis bullshit. The meta-shit like being ""depressed about being depressed"" and ""anxious about having anxiety"" thing is just ridiculous. I knew for a long time that all it took to make things better was a change of perspective that took will power. I was staring at the exit of my self imposed box for a long time and not doing anything because I was afraid. My misery was comfortable and easy. I'm over that now. I want a challenge. I'm going to NGAF again but in a different way. It will be based on acceptance and honesty rather than apathy and irresponsibility.",I went crazy and was depressed and anxious but now I realize I've been a lazy pussy.

"So me and this guy have been official since last night, but have been a thing for a while. But he was always dating someone else or I was too, but we finally got together. We went to a carnival in my town last night, and we had a lot of fun but he said a few things that really offended me, though there were way more compliments than accidental insults. 
 Well, he turns 18 in July and he plans on getting a tattoo on his birthday. He was talking about how painful it would be because its on his shoulder and he was saying how it was just skin and bone there (he's very skinny) and how he said it was a different story for me. Well, I am a little chubby, but I have been losing weight. But still, ouch! 
 He also kept talking about some ex's. One of his, we'll call her Donna. Donna and him were serious, and she's also a good friend of mine. She's how I met him. But anyway, they dated last year for 9 months and promised to be each other's first which they weren't, they never went through with it. She dumped him because her sisters said he was cheating and he said ""I couldnt have done anything like that Donna. Shes too amazing and I love her too much."" Not LOVED but LOVE. As in present tense. Dafuq? 
 He also kept making out with me in public. I dont like that. And tried fingering me in the park and night. No. Im on my period and we havent been dating that long, and no, we;'re in public. DURING A HUGE CARNIVAL. COPS EVERYWHERE.

"My (23F) boyfriend (24M) of two years is still a mystery to me. When we first met, he chased me and compromised a lot of things to me. He would do what you'd call Grand Romantic Gestures almost everyday just to get me to talk to him. He was romantic, he would sing praises to me and how he thought I was the most special girl ever, and he'd avoid inconveniencing me. 
 Fast-forward two years later, everything seems different. We had had problems one year in. He became different. I know that limerence died out and complacency will set in in every single relationship, but with him, everything was so drastically different. He said that he wasn't used with using words to display his affection. That he was more of a phisical guy. I love having sex with him and we always have great sex life, but aside from that, I felt thirsty emotionally. He could talk to me for hours, but when I asked him to just say sweet nothings to me (something that he would have done before), he froze up and said that it just wasn't his style. 
 I feel like I'm rambling. The thing is, the things that he had done previously, he stopped doing that. He stopped talking to me that much, saying that he had things to do. He stopped giving me rides, saying that gas is expensive. He stopped getting me into restaurants, opting to ask me to cook for him, because it was too expensive. He became stingy, and I think he started taking me for granted. He blamed it all on our differences, and that he was simply behaving in a different language in the five language of loves. 
 I feel like I'm at loss already, and I could see this relationship crash and burn any time. He doesn't compromise, but he also doesn't want me to go. He doesn't make any efforts to keep me, but when I mentioned breaking up, he would jack up every single tricks in the book and win me back. I feel like I'm addicted to him, and the fact that he always kept me on my toes drove me crazy.","Boyfriend claims that we're operating on a different language of love, doesn't compromise, doesn't want to break up.

"Hi there! I was diagnosed with ADHD - emphasis on the ""H"" - in 4th grade. I will be entering my senior year and recently I've came into a depressive episode in my life for the past 4 or so months. I have complete lack of motivation, and just feel  terrible  most of the time. I even consider suicide sometimes, but do not plan on going through with it. I don't even know why the fuck I feel this way, I've read online people who are depressed are depressed about something, but I can't figure out what I'm depressed about. I'd also like to add that my entire family has a history of depression, (general) anxiety disorder(s), and my dad is ADHD, as is my sister (terribly!) 
 I stopped taking my ADHD medicine after my freshman year. I cannot even recall why I did so. I got a prescription to adderall xr 25mg and decided to take it again to see how I'd feel. I've taken it once since - yesterday, 1PM. I'm still up today, 5:30AM. Little but noticeable crash was noticed around 12AM, but after eating some food and drinking tons of water it was no issue. However, I felt absolutely great throughout the day. I accomplished so many tasks, was extremely social, and was full of confidence throughout the day. 
 This brings me to my question.  I'd like to note that I am still ADHD - I can't sit still and watch a movie unless I'm totally into it, working on projects is a major task for me, and I skip between songs all the time (does anybody else do this? - fuck there is my ADD again.) 
 Will adderall actually help my depression, or did I just feel really good yesterday because of that first-time (at least in years) euphoric ""high""? Also, how much will tolerance build up taking 25mg XR once daily? 
 I'd also like to note that I take Sceletium tortuosum - a natural SSRI and PDE4 inhibitor. It helps boost my mood greatly, but the lack of confidence is there. That is something adderall completely fixed. Combining the two floods your brain with both dopamine and serotonin - although I notice no crash on Sceletium. Adderall was minor for me.","Is adderal good for treating depression (along with a natural ssri), or did I just feel good because of the ""high"" first day taking it?

"I [22M] have known (of) this girl [20F] for a couple of years at my workplace but only in the past 3 months have we decided to talk. Our rosters only matched on weekends and while some weekends we could have a casual conversation during breaks, sometimes we could only manage a 'Hi', if anything at all as we work in completely separate areas with very few overlapping duties. Other than both of us being First-Aid attendants, we rarely worked together or knew much about each other and never had the time. 
 She finished her resignation 3 weeks ago and we had a slow walk & talk on the way out (she brought up that she graduated with a degree in biomedical science, was getting entry to a degree in pharmaceutical science and got a entry level job in a pharmacy. A career path I previously studied for and still had a interest in but had a offer in an alternative career and parted ways) and talked by her car for about 15 minutes before I abruptly asked if she wanted to keep in contact after I found we had a common interest and just genuinely wanted to know more about her and her reasons (I previously had no intention and would have just left it at goodbye and goodluck) and she gave me her Facebook. I added her a couple of days later and popped her a message asking how she was and she pretty much immediately gave me her number after she made a light-hearted joke about how often I (don't) use Facebook. 
 Anyway, we went out for a coffee on Monday at around 5~ on my day off and after she finished work (she moved in with 2 other girls the week before and she lives with them during her work week but she goes back home to her mother on her days off who lives over an hour away in the city).
Originally, we were both thinking we would chat for about half an hour until the place closed, but as the coffee shop didn't close until late, we talked for a good 2 and a half hours before it got late and we really needed to leave for work tomorrow. Everything was pretty relaxed, open and never a dull/awkward moment. I walked her to her car and she suggested we should do it again (I didn't have any input as I was thinking it was a one off meeting. We're going to the same place again but an hour earlier this Tuesday.) 
 Now... Going out for coffee with someone I barely know is something I've never done and I just dove in without much worry or concern but as a side-effect, I was honestly oblivious to the fact of whether she was interested in a relationship or of her intentions. My previous relationships were with people I got to know over a period of months at university as lab partners and such and things just naturally went on to dating as we went outside. 
 The things previously stated seem to suggest that she's pretty keen for dating, but she's very career/professionally driven while her personality is very mature for her age while being cute and bubbly... I'm fairly sure she hasn't been in a relationship for a few years (since highschool?), which is odd as she's a solid 8.5-9/10. Are there any quirks or actions I should look out for that would hint that she's interested while on our second outing?

"I have been thus far unable to find a person, other than my brother, who is unbiased and is willing to hold a real and serious conversation with me about religion. 
 Being a teenage girl, I recently began thinking deeply about my own beliefs; truthfully, I am utterly torn. I'd like to assume that this is not too uncommon, but nonetheless, it is what has happened to me. 
 I was raised a conservative Christian and never thought twice about it when I was a child. 
 At the current point in my life, my best friend is an atheist, and my second closest friend is Catholic. As far as my other less important friends go, I have an equal amount of religious and nonreligious friends. My parents are both Christians, though my mother rarely attends church anymore as she is upset with organized religion. My father is still closed-minded in his region and a very religious person, but not an extreme Christian, as far as I’ve been able to understand. - basically, I have extreme influences from both sides of the ""war"". 
 Within the past year, I claimed atheist-agnostic (to my immediate family, except my dad, and my best friend only) because I really have no idea if there is God or not. It has proven to be a truly difficult task; to throw my previous religion out of my mind in order to contemplate merely facts and not dwell on instilled faith. 
 Unhelpfully, I want not only the simplicity of figuring out my own philosophies but to understand others' views as well. This is particularly challenging. Everyone seems to have a general view of their religion, but then continues to bend and twist miniscule details so that they can put it in their own words. How many types of Christians are there? There are those that receive homosexuality and those that claim it is demonic, those that seek as much fact to prove the Bible correct and those that say faith is the only thing they can do, those that spend their money on large flat-screen TVs in order to “better spread his word” and those that spend their money on giving fifty meals to the homeless shelter. Not to mention the different types of Islamic, Judaism, Hinduism, Shinto, and so many more. 
 Adding to that thought: how is everyone so incredibly sure of their faith? If one of them is right, then the rest of the world is going to “Hell”. I use that word generally, as I’m sure that not all religions use “Heaven and Hell”. 
 How does one go about deciding what they believe, given all the options? How does logic fit into each of the separate religions and make them any different than fairy tales or wishes? And why do so many people claim to be a part of a religion when they could just as easily become nonreligious and it wouldn’t change a thing, except not spending a few hours in church on Sunday? 
 There’s so much more to think about and to talk about, and so much more that I could learn and that I could discuss if anyone were actually willing. I’m hoping that talking to people who are more open-minded will allow me to explore and find my own religion, or lack-there-of. 
So my fellow redditors, if you would be so kind as to give me your time and talk to me about religion, it would be very much appreciated.
Be warned that I like listening and learning and may ask more questions than actually making conversation.

"I (I am female, 35) have a friend, Trisha, who is married to a man of similar age and they have 2 young kids.  He has been arrested in a prior relationship for domestic violence, but told Trisha that it was a crazy ex-girlfriend and she shrugged it off. 
 I have never seen her as miserable as she has been this last year.  He calls and yells at her for not being home, while he can come and go as he pleases.  It's awful yelling with name calling, swearing and threats.  She will be out with a group of us and he will reduce her to tears and she will have to leave.  I am honestly not sure if she just doesn't want to rock the boat or she is scared.  She has said before that she is sometimes scared to leave him alone with the kids.  Trisha does not go out very often or do things for herself. 
 He has temper tantrums where he breaks things.  Expensive items.  He has been physical once (that I know of), but swears he was drugged by a friend (does not sound legit, I know).  He was finally put on medication for anger.  But the last weekend while we were on a weekend away, he acted drunk/high, was extremely irritable with everyone, and made his wife miserable and she spent a vacation weekend in tears.  All the kids were concerned, and they spent their time yelling and swearing and arguing together.  It was clear that they didn't like each other, but then she'd be all over him.

"I (22F) met my boyfriend (24M) 3 years ago, through some mutual friends.  He was pretty guarded, and I was the one that pursued him.  We were long distance (I was living in Oregon, he was living in Washington) until I moved in with him last year. 
 My boyfriend has only had one other relationship and a hookup before me.  He stopped talking to the hookup a long time ago because she was crazy, but he kept in touch with his ex until she cut contact with him around 2 years ago.  They dated when he was 15 and it lasted for around 2 years, and then she dumped him because ""he had no self-respect.""  Apparently she's the reason why my boyfriend is so guarded now.  I'll admit that I was really jealous of her and was glad when she cut contact with him, because she's beautiful and my boyfriend talked about her as if she had all of life's answers. 
 This past January I woke up in the middle of the night and I heard my boyfriend crying quietly.  I could tell that he was looking at his phone, and I wasn't sure whether or not to say anything since I wasn't sure if he just wanted a private moment or not.  After a while he got up to go to the bathroom, so I took a peek at his phone.  He was on Facebook, looking at his ex's profile.  She had gotten engaged and there were pictures of the ring and everything.

"Here's the story:  This took place when I was around 14 years old (I am now 24). My mom was always coming up with these ""get rich quick"" schemes, and one day she saw this nation-wide modeling ""try-outs"" was coming to our city. Her first thought was to take my sister, as she's a good lookin' lady. I don't remember exactly how or why, but I ended up coming along against my will. When we got to the place, they made all the entries sit and wait until they called you up to the front of the room to basically just give you a once-over and make sure you were good looking or something. Well after an uncomfortable wait time, I got bored and filled out one of the applications as well. I jokingly put my name as ""Ace"" (that is not my real name). When they called for me to come to the front of the room, I strode up all confidently and honestly, pretty stupidly. Miraculously, it somehow worked! They passed both me and my sister on to the ""next round"" which took place in another city! 
 Several months later, we traveled to Chicago (probably 6 hours from where we lived) for the modeling convention and try-outs. I remember it took place at this huge hotel. All ""contestants"" got split into 2 groups and received a number. We spent the afternoon in a seminar that taught us how to walk a catwalk and basically do other modeling shit. If I wasn't 14, I probably would have used that time to hit on chicks (if I was smarter). 
 The actual nerve-wracking part is, that night we had to walk a catwalk in front of representatives from over 100 different modeling agencies. That part was pretty fucking crazy, now that I think about it, but I did it. When it was all over, my sister didn't get a callback from any of the agencies (which surprised my mom and I, because we thought she'd be a shoe-in) but I actually got a callback from one agency! At the time, I thought it was pretty cool but I ultimately didn't pursue it, because as I mentioned I only entered as a joke and didn't really want to be a model.  Looking back, I really wish I had given the agency a call, because my life probably could have turned out very differently! 
 Anyway, that's my story, feel free to AMA!","I tagged along to modeling tryouts with my sister, jokingly entered the tryouts and was accepted onto the nationals, traveled to Chicago to walk a catwalk before 100s of modeling agencies, and actually caught the eye of one of the agencies.",24,M,IAmA
"2015 was a rough year for me. My girlfriend left me after cheating on me emotionally (after taking advantage of my kindness and love by giving her the green light to explore her bisexuality for the first time, explicitly stating I was ok with her having sex so long as no romance was inbolved). She did it just after I had given my two months notice. She had been living at my place for 8 months, the plan was for me to live with her and save money until we could afford our own 1 or 2 bedroom apartment. I ended up staying with my parents who are covert narcissits (see /r/raisedbynacissists), treated me like a child even tho I am 27. 
 I ended up being desperate for a roommate, and being in for a surprise when a friend from work turned out to be sketchy, manipulative, and lazy. He's also living in his own little world and doesn't understand reality. I ended up being the only person who cleaned the apartment (bathroom, floors etc) and I even cleaned up his own messes (his stew splattered all over my microwave, dunno why he couldn't just heat it up in a pot or clean up my microwave after using it). I fronted him some money so we could snag the inexpensive apartment I found, and he took ages paying me back. He was buying himself fast food constantly, new video games for his PS4, even bragging about buying over 200 dollars worth of weed when he owed me 300. 
 We had horrible neighbours who broke the law on numerous occasions. They world purposefully make as much noise in the morning and wake us up. At first I didn't bother having them charged with disturbing the police because I didn't know I could. We have a 7 am to 11 pm window where people are allowed to use electronics (eg. TV, stereo) and I thought the same window applied to dropping heavy objects on the floor, stomping, or going out of the way to slam a vacuum cleaner while vacuumung at 9AM). By the time I learned that for noises that they were making there was a 24/7 noise bylaw for, my roommate had started to become very inconsiderate. 
 One of his friends was over one night, I don't know if it was the roommate or the friend but someone was dropping something very loud and heavy every half hour until 1 AM when I grumpily told them to stop it as I had to wake up early to study. The neighbours thought it was me making the noise that night and focused their efforts directly above my bedroom at 7AM the next morning. I was tired and stressed and ended up missing a quiz and an assignment that day but luckily my professors were kind and understanding. 
 I immediately started sleeping at my parents (so that I could do well on my final exams, them not letting me be out as late as I wanted wasn't an issue during exam time). I got all my necessities and expensive belongings and planned on moving all my furniture and the rest of my things when I found a new place. 
 January was the last month that I paid for but my roommate thought since I wasn't sleeping there any longer I was no longer a tenant. He changed the lock without notifying me with the permission of the landlord. I had to break the lock in order to get something that I needed immediately (a notepad and a pen to write a list of places to apply to for a new job). Right off the bat I said that I would pay for the door but the landlord called the police and tried to have me charged, lying and saying I never offered to pay for the door. 
 I told them both that the lock was illegal and that they needed to put the old one back on or give me a copy for the replacement but I was ignored. 
 Its illegal for a landlord to change the locks on a paying tenant, and its illegal for a roommate to change the lock on another roommate without a restraining order. 
 The lock ended up costing less than my month of rent, so when I apply to the Landlord and Tenant board to have my rent returned the landlord will actually end up owing me money. 
 As well it is a criminal offence in Ontario to change the locks like this, a whole different organization than the LTB will conduct an investigation at my request. The landlord can be fined up to $25,000 in criminal charges, and the roommate can be fined up to $10,000 in criminal charges, $100 per day the lock was changed in civil charges, and up to three times the value of any damages to my belongings. 
 I would have preferred my roommate to be the decent guy he pretended to be, so that we could have worked through the issue with the neighbour (which only got worse after the shady landlord got involved), but I'll settle for justice. Karma is a bitch, and it always ends in my favour.

"Several months ago, my 18 year old cousin was in a car accident which nearly took her life. Thankfully, she survived, but suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI) as a result. This means that she entered into a coma and is only recently starting to interact with the world outside the bounds of her head. She has been at an acute rehabilitation center, which offers top-of-the-line occupational, physical, speech therapy. Though the steps have been small, she has been making progress: her CRS score fluctuates around 12…which doesn’t really mean a whole lot to most of us, but from what I gather she can respond to commands such as “move your right foot”, “blink twice if your sister is in the room”, so we know she’s still in there, especially since she couldn’t even breathe for herself a few months ago! 
 Here’s the problem: my family’s insurance company says that they will not pay for her to stay at the Acute Care Facility because the rate of her improvement has slowed. They want to put her in a Sub-Acute Care Facility, which is essentially a nursing home, where they will not be able to offer her nearly the same amount of resources or attention as her current facility. 
 We have one week to formulate an appeal to this decision, so if anyone out there knows anything about this stuff/dealing with insurance companies, it would be wonderful if you could offer some insight. We basically have to prove that moving her to a nursing home will be detrimental to her progress of recovery from the TBI. Any PubMed articles or case studies you folks may know of to support this will be extremely helpful.

"I am 24 years old and I recently broke up with my girlfriend of 3 years. I've known this woman for a decade. We were very good friends before we dated, I never met someone who completed me the way that she did. Someone that I could have a conversation with and not feel like I'm talking to a two-dimensional cardboard cut-out. I confessed to her that I had romantic feelings for her, and she reciprocated. A relationship soon developed. We were together long distance for 2 years, and then I moved up to where she lived. Long story short, I think the moving in was too fast and our relationship spiraled down rather quickly. We put each other through a lot, and hurt each other dearly. But I still love her, and I miss her every day. I recently moved back to Milwaukee and we still keep in contact somewhat. I gave my first kiss to her, my virginity, my everything. She means the world to me and I would give anything to have her back. We were going to get married, for Christ's sake. 
 I just don't know what to do with myself anymore. Sure, our relationship wasn't perfect but it was OURS. I loved her, she loved me. We may not have had the best communication in the world but at least we were happy. Now I feel like I will never experience that happiness again. I know that I am not unattractive, nor am I boring, or overly insecure. I can easily GET another woman, but I simply feel completely shattered without her. She really was my other half and no-one can fit in the hole that she left. I come off as aloof and distant. Very far from the rest of the world to everyone around me, so they assume I'm ""over"" it. All I want to do is collapse in on myself like a singularity so I don't have to feel this empty anymore. 
 I'm glad to finally have this off my chest but it doesn't really make me feel much better. I guess it would have been more ""cathartic"" to talk about how much I hated her, or how much of a bitch she was, etc. But I can't lie to myself anymore. She is beautiful, smart, loving, and fun. I love her with all of my heart and soul. Any advice would be appreciated dearly.",My fiance' and I broke up. I still love her. She misused me but I don't care. The hell do I do?,24,M,offmychest
"My parents also lived through the depression, and my Mom also never throws anything away. 
 In her laundry room there are products and supplies whose labels are clearly in the style of the 1950s, and which have likely never been used in my lifetime (I'm 49).  Does anybody even still  use  liquid starch? 
 In the upstairs medicine cabinet there's a little bottle of NuSkin marked ""[my Dad's name]'s"" -- he died 21 years ago, as well as many other supplies I know were his in the last years of his life.  There's also a bottle of white shoe polish, even though I've never, ever seen her wear white shoes. 
 In the kitchen pantry there's a little bottle of vinegar, marked (so she would remember) ""1996."" 
 She regularly reuses, say, the jar that Ovaltine comes in (which she gets from her friend--my family has never bought-or-drunk Ovaltine--) for apple cider and such.  She relabels the jar by writing, in real small, faint letters in pencil, ""CIDER"" on the large, bright, obvious Ovaltine label. (Once when I was a kid, she put cider-colored cleaning solution in an old cider jug and labeled it ""cleaning solution"" in the same manner.  Dad gave her hell for that one -- ""somebody might well have thought that was still cider, and drunk it!"" -- but it didn't stop her using the general principle.) 
 She currently refuses to pay my daughter $50 for seven hours' work cleaning the house every month, because ""the house doesn't get dirty that fast;"" she won't do it any more often than every  other  month, and even that's usually something of a fight. 
 She manages to grudgingly tip in restaurants, but only about 3% (and bitches about  that ); I always sneak back to the table and lay down another 10-15% or more.

"Hey. I'm gonna do lsd for the first time soon, I've been planning it and reading about it for a long time now. 
 Little bit about me and my history with psychedelics: 
 I'm 24, male. I've done mushrooms for ~8 times, few times 25i-nBOMe (Some years ago, not smart but not bad times either).  I've had some great experiences with mushrooms and I've been intrigued to try lsd for a few years now. I'd say that the strongest trip I've had was a level 4 trip with about 3 grams of cubensis, a great experience. 
 As I said in the title, I've never tried any psychedelics alone, there has always been some other people tripping too. However I have kinda wanted to be alone at some point in many of those mushroom trips, but was not able to find a peaceful place with no other people distracting me. 
 Now I have a perfect opportunity to try. Set & setting is gonna be almost as good as possible, familiar house with surrounding nature, privacy and summer :) I'm also in a good mindset right now, life is good at the moment. 
 I have a few 200µg tabs, and I haven't made the decision if I should split one tab in half, or take a full one right away. There is a little piece of me saying that it is my first time tripping alone, so I should take only half a tab first. Then again a part of me is saying that I should embrace the first time and a good set&setting by taking a whole tab of 200µg. 
 What do you say? Been reading many of the comparisons between dosages and many stories of first times, only with the difference that many of the first time-storytellers have never tripped with any other psychedelics.","Some experience with psychedelics.

"So, I'm a 22 year old FTM and have been secret dating a 25 year old woman for about two months. She identifies as queer, but is also a practicing Muslim. She is in the closet with her family, friends, school, and work. 
 I am fairly early in my transition and do not pass very often, but will likely be masculine enough in appearance within 6 months or so to be presented to her family without comment. I'm in the process of getting my name and gender marker changed so official stuff like that isn't really a problem. 
 Funnily enough, the biggest issue between us isn't that I'm transgender or that I'm a white dude; no, it's that I'm not a Muslim. She basically said that her family will never approve of anything between us, which makes her hesitant to pursue anything despite having told me that she is very interested and emotionally attached already. 
 We had a discussion several days ago where she admitted that she was at a fork in the road: to please her family and marry a brown Muslim guy and reproduce asap, or go for me? I felt really shitty that she felt like she had to choose between her family and myself. 
 I know it's a bit soon to say something like this, but I really feel that I love this woman. She is somebody I could see myself starting a family with and having around for a very long time. This isn't some kiddie crush that I can just not pursue with no repercussions. I don't want something stupid like her family's blatant racial and religious intolerance to ruin this, but I don't really know what to do. 
 To be honest, the only options I really see are converting to Islam, which isn't really something that I want to do; or letting her piss off her entire family and potentially get outcast. Does anyone have some advice?",I'm in love with a Muslim girl and it sucks.,22,M,relationships

"So when I was younger and more of a tool I go for a morning workout with my friend. I hadn't eaten anything yet. I warm up, do my abs, among other muscle groups, then go up stairs to cool down. 
 There are only two open treadmills so my friend takes the one at the end and I take the other one beside a cute girl my age. Naturally being a tool I try to up the speed to 'impress' the girl. 5 minutes in I get a little barp (burp that tastes like barf), followed by a bigger barp about 15 seconds later. Finally I yak until my mouth is full and I quickly stop the machine and hold my fist to my cheeks to prevent leaks. 
 At this point the cute girl stares at my so I man up and swallow the barf. Panicking, I speed walk over to my friend to tell him what just happened but before I can say a word I explosively yak all over the floor.

"I've recently entered my first real relationship at the age of 19, and i feel woefully unprepared for this. I really like this girl, but things are kind of complicated so I'll try my best to explain. 
 First of all, I met her on a social networking app, and she lives kind of far away. Same country, but a three hour train journey which costs around £60. On top of that, she is from a Muslim family, and her parents don't approve of her being in a relationship, which means when I go down to see her I can't stay with her, we have to either only see each other for the day or book a hotel. She can't easily come up to see me because of this as well. 
 All this aside, the thing that prompted me to make this post is myself. She had a pretty fucked up break up with her last partner, who told her out of the blue that he wanted to get a sex change. Thing is, this guy is still in the picture somewhat. She called the relationship off with him after the sex change shit, then when he found out she had spent the weekend with me he then retracted it and said he still wanted to be with her. While she has said she would choose me over him if it came to it, which it shouldn't, she said she still does have some feelings for him and it tears me up. 
 I try to ignore it the best I can, but when we have the situation with the distance it makes it so much harder. We both have exams coming up, and so it's likely the next time we will see each other in person is mid-june, and the stuff with her ex just eats away at me and I don't know what to do about it. 
 Last night we were on Skype and I was looking through her old facebook pictures and saw some of her with her ex and it just made me feel shitty. I guess seeing as i've never really done this before its making me realise some things about myself, like I'm very jealous. She obviously noticed that something had happened, as after the skype she texted me and asked if something was up. When i explained, she just said ""I'm sorry"".

"Obvious throw away here because my friends know my normal account 
 So I'm a senior in High School, and it's starting to get close to when people start asking others to prom. Last year I had a gf(V) so there wasn't any real issue with finding a date or if she'd go with me, this year I don't have that. This is where my problem lies. 
 Little Background first: 
 I have known this girl(E) since sophomore year, she's now a freshmen in College, I met her through my ex who was her bestfriend at the time(They are no longer close). We always got along well given we shared conservative views on things. We were never really close until I broke up with my gf this summer and she texted me to see how I was holding up. We started talking occasionally, just chit chat stuff. Eventually over time and her breaking up with her bf, we got closer. Eventually it got to the point where she kept making statements about how great of a guy I am and any girl would be lucky to date me, to eventually she asked me out on a date(Literally a day before I was going to ask her to), and then immediately back tracked after I made a joke that she said ""was something her ex would have said that she hated"". Things kinda petered out from there until one day she texts me angrily asking me why I lied to her, this confused me as I had never lied to her to my knowledge and so I asked her what she was talking about, she never responded. A few months go by and I'm still in the dark and still really into her and missing her and our talks. Out of the blue one day she texts me and asks me why I lied again about 3 months later. I just tell her I have no idea what she's talking about, she then tells me my ex had told her(E) that somethings I shared to her were all lies, when they were true, and I had proof of it. So since then we've talked and she's made comments about how me and her dad are the only good guys she knows, and we joke about how crappy guys are and what not given her experiences with them. 
 Current Situation: 
 I have no idea where we stand right now. She's off at college and I only see her once every couple weeks. She's still single, but she talks to me about guys that she meets in classes, but nothing ever goes anywhere. I try to make plans to hang out but they always fall through. I'm hopefully (fingers crossed) taking her to a concert in two weeks, not as a date though, I often take her to concerts/sporting events that we have extra tickets for. She's told me she never says no to a first date but I don't know how to initiate that, my last, and only, relationship just kinda happened, I never had to ask her out. One day we're talking nonstop the next it's sparingly. She gets upset when I don't respond after reading her texts for multiple hours though, which really isn't an issue just trying to get everything I can think of down. I tell her she's pretty and beautiful and sweet and all that jazz just kinda offhandedly and she never really says anything special or whatever. I'm just totally lost and new to this whole thing so I wanted some help. /:

Anyway we eventually start talking and she's just being friendly not even sloppy drunk yet so we play beer pong in which she ends up trolling (for any of you virgins out there it's when someone plays an entire game without making a cup) so by rule her name has to go on the troll board and be signed and dated.

So here's the thing. This girl I've been talking to has been kind of..off and on and I just don't know how to interpret it. For example, she takes forever to reply, and rarely asks any questions. Right there your probably thinking what I was thinking..yeah shes not interested. But here's the thing. I kinda just gave up on her for a day and she messaged me and apologized (which I didn't expect at all). I told her it was okay and that I understood she probably just gets a bunch of messages (shes fkin gorgeous) and she replied by telling me that its all just 'creeps that she doesn't even respond to'. She then 'liked' me on the site and has also agreed to meet me. 
 So I was thinking..okay this is sounding a lot better. But despite this her responses haven't really changed. The weird thing is that I've noticed from her status that she really only seems to come online to answer my messages. 
 Honestly I'm not planning on playing this game. There are other girls im talking to that are responsive and show interest and would rather date them. But I've just never been so confused.

 First thing's first - I approached with a big smile and gave them my name so they could get a ""car jockey"" to bring down the hoopdee. It was obvious a huge thunderstorm was coming, so the first thing I asked was whether they brought their umbrellas to work. Noticed that HB7A was itching her nose, and I started teasing her a bit about it. ""Your secret thunderstorm sense."" I told her she looked really cute and all I wanted to do was scratch her nose for her. I asked if they get a lot of douche bag customers being rude to them and so forth, and HB7B told me she often deals with drunk rich dudes trying to run game (drunk? really?). 
 Next I found out their credit card reader was broken, and they had to process the transaction with a paper record. Out comes the slidey-machine. Told them about my fond memories of my mom paying for cabs with the slidey-machines when I was a little kid and transitioned to my natural interest in the cab industry. Her slidey-machine was also on the fritz and I told her she was like the modern day MacGyver as she scraped her pen across the paper receipt with my card under it. She said, ""Who's MacGyver?"" I stared her in utter disbelief and told her MacGyver is the world's great detective and she needs to watch more vintage TV. 
 At a certain point HB7B started the whole, ""You're really funny. I bet you're fun to hang out with"" thing and I knew I was good to go. HB7A said, ""feel free to go look at some cars, yours should be ready soon."" I replied by saying, ""Yeah ok it can be like a game of hide and go seek. You have to come and find me. It'll be super fun. I might be in a trunk."" She liked that. 
 I sauntered over to the back of the showroom and saw a fairly good looking (another HB7) Sales Associate. I asked her some silly questions about the new C400 (what's up with that tacked-on display, looks like a glued on iPad knockoff) before I realized she had a cool accent. I told her I had zero interest in buying a car (waiting for maintenance) but we should keep talking because it was fairly empty. I asked her where she was from and responded that she grew up in Cairo before moving to Canada for University. 
 As soon as she told me those two details it was over. She crossed from the ""professional"" frame to the ""non-professional"" frame. So I just showed insane interest in Cairo and what it was like growing up there and what was the economy like for educated people and jobs and culture and just tell me everything. She had anime eyes going pretty hard after ten minutes of genuine wonder and excitement about her story. 
 At this point, HB7B was walking over towards us, and she approached, seeing her competition smiling and laughing, and told me the ride was ready. Cue awkward eye contact between HB7B and Sales Associate. I said thanks and she left. At this point, I told Sales Associate that she was awesome and I loved our conversation. She should give me her number so we could talk more about all of it. First number closed. 
 Next, left the showroom and walked back to the service counter to say thanks. Looked at HB7B (I liked her better than HB7A) and told her she was awesome and would love to hang out and scratch her nose sometime (right in front of her friend, who cracked a big smile). She said, ""Are you sure? Looks like you got along with Sales Associate pretty well."" I just said,""Do you blame her? Your friend also thinks I'm fun.""  Number 2 closed. 
 I deleted them both when I got in my car. Like I said, I'm in a LTR. But it felt great.","Dropped off car for service. Gave no fucks and had lots of fun. Picked up the car a few days later, along with a Service Receptionist and Sales Associate.",29,M,seduction
"Sorry if this turns out to be a wall of text, but here goes; 
 I'm 39 years old (nearly 40) and for the last 7-8 years I've worked in the IT industry in varying aspects of support.  Prior to that, I served in the military where I worked medical for 5 years (stayed working medical for another 2 after I got out).  I never got a nursing degree while I was in, and at most was only National Registry EMT Certified (which expired about a decade ago).  I switched to IT because I really wanted to work with computers.  I never hated working in a hospital/clinic, I just thought I'd be a lot happier working with computers. 
 Over the last year, I've become progressively more and more annoyed and unhappy doing what I do.  My productivity is down and I find myself completely unmotivated to do anything but plug into video games when I get home.  I've searched for other jobs within the field however, as we all know, the job market sucks.  Also, I realize as I look at these other positions that I doubt I will be any happier anywhere else because I'd be doing what I am now. 
 During my job searching, I realize that I was never this miserable when I worked in the medical field.  In addition, the intrinsic reward for working medical was much greater than what I do now, where I feel like I bust my ass to help people and get shit in return from mostly ungrateful clients. 
 I've been thinking of enrolling into a local L.P.N. program, which is a year long.  Once I get my L.P.N. I should be able to get a job and while I work I can hopefully complete my R.N. degree.  My question is this, AskReddit, do you think this is wise given the current job market and the fact that I'm nearly 40 and thinking of changing my career BACK to what I did before.  I would especially love to hear some feedback from people who currently work in Healthcare/Nursing.","I used to work as a medic, now I'm an IT dude.

"Now, firstly, I'd say I'm pretty experienced with women. I'd consider myself shy, yes, but I've have numerous gfs, and once I get past the first stage of meeting someone, I'm pretty talkative and natural. I also perform as musician so I've learned pretty effectively how to fake confidence in nerve-racking situation. 
 But this girl makes me ridiculously nervous. I feel like I'm 14 again. I don't think I've ever liked a girl this much. She's giving me quite a few reasons to think she's interested (and maybe a couple to think she's not to be fair) but I think my nervousness is ruining things. I can't really prolong conversations (she asks me questions about my life/background and all I can say is ""yeah"" and nod my head or give the most basic answer), I don't really know where to put my hands (we're pretty touchy feely with each other, but I overthink it constantly), I get so nervous it takes me hours to build the courage to text her for fear of rejection or saying the wrong thing, whenever she teases me to be flirty I ruin it by taking it seriously (not in an offended way, just in a, ""is that what you think of me"" way which shows I don't get the joke) making a move to kiss her absolutely scares the shit out of me, I'm just a bloody wreck around her. 
 She seems pretty nervous too, but not nearly as bad, it just makes me like her more (little things like when she blushes or where we just hold eye contact with nothing to say, or when she just stands there not wanting to leave when it's time to go home), but I'm pretty sure I going to fuck this up. We had one super long convo when we first met (basically hung out all night) but liquid courage definitely helped that night, and I can't just be buzzed all the time with her. Any advice? Any one ever been through something like this before? How can I be less of a bumbing idiot around this girl?

"Oh reddit, I need some help. 
 I'm 23/f, he's 22/m. We met and just got along really well, there was noticeable chemistry in how we talked and interacted, others commented all the time. After a few months of flirting, we've been officially dating for a little over a month. In the beginning of the relationship, he made it very clear that he wanted to take it slow, ""We'll see where it goes"" was the mantra right from the start. 
 Tonight I got a text, the dreaded words, 
 ""We need to talk"" 
 Uh oh. 
 ""But I'll save it for tomorrow. I'm drunk, I want to give you the dignity of hearing it when I'm not an idiot"" 
 Well shit. This must be it, I thought, the end of this short fling. I felt like a prisoner on death row, just waiting for the final buzz from the electric chair. Luckily, his drunk self couldn't wait (as drunk selves are wont to do), and I got a followup text roughly 13 minutes later. 
 ""Look, my ex I really liked her a lot. I loved her. Probably why I'm taking it really slow right now. I dont know, probably because of old feelings and stuff. You aren't a rebound, I get along with you, we have a lot in common. I was hesitant to start the relationship, but I like that we don't have drama and are honest with each other. I like that you don't get mad easily, and that you have goals in life. I respect that."" 
 I know he dated this girl for about two years, and that they're still in contact, but I don't know how long ago the relationship ended or who broke it off or any details. I feel like hearing that should have hurt more than it did, I feel totally willing to take it as slow as he needs. Despite his assurance that I'm not just filling a gap, I'm afraid of that. I'm afraid he'll never get over her enough to love me, in the long run. 
 He asked, when I gave a response indicating that I was thankful for him being honest with me and that we can take it as slow as it needs to go, ""Aren't you afraid of wasting time?"" He refused to elaborate further, but I knew what he meant. Was I afraid of sitting in this relationship that he sees staying idle for a while because of his inability to fully let her go for now. 
 Beyond that, something that bothered me is how he listed out all these objective things, it reads more like a used car checklist than a poem, and that makes me feel like he likes how laissez faire I've been with the relationship so far (which I've tried to do in order to respect his wish to take it slow) more than he likes me as a person. Maybe I'm reading too far into that, maybe I'm expecting too much from a drunken 3am text message. But that almost got to me more than the intended message. 
 It felt good to write that all out. I care about him a lot and have a lot of fun with him, and I don't know how to feel about all of this. Any opinions, reddit? Do you think he'll ever let her go? Am I just a square peg he's trying to fit in the void she left?","My boyfriend of a month confessed he is having trouble moving further in our relationship because of old feelings, asked that we take it slow.

"First, i'll give some back story to our relationship to help bring everyone up to speed. My girlfriend and I have known each other for 8+ years and have been best friends ever since we met in high school. We have always had feelings for each other but the timing was never right for us. We've dated different people but we both came to the realization about how strong our feelings really were for each other down the road. So, I made the decision that I didn't want to be with anyone else and waited 2 years for the time to be right, and now we're dating! I'm truly lucky to be in love with my best friend. 
 I'm a recent college graduate and began putting my new degree to work at a start up business. This job is everything I've ever wanted in a job. I get to unleash my entrepreneurial side and since i'm young, have a lot less to lose if this business fails. I see a lot of potential with this business to be a multi-million dollar a year company and getting in at the beginning is huge, but it's not about the money for me. It's about developing myself in my job field. Even if this business fails, i'll have learned and developed a long list of skills that can launch me into jobs that I never thought were possible for me. 
 My boss is easy to work with and I see him more of a mentor now, not just a boss. He's helping me along the way with exposing me to as much of the business world as he can. We work well together and bounce ideas off each other, we are great at what we do and I trust he isn't playing me for a fool by trying to launch his business only to reward me very little. Since it's a startup business cash flow is tight, which leaves me with very little pay. I was aware of this from the beginning and I will be rewarded for my efforts if the business succeeds or fails. 
 As the title states, my girlfriend and I have been together for a little over a year now and we are approaching the point in our relationship where we decide how to take the next step in our relationship. We both see a future with one another and at this point we are looking to get a little more serious about our relationship but have hit a wall trying to figure out how to do that. 
 When my girlfriend and I first started dating I was very upfront about my goals for my future. I'm a very hard worker and I planned to pay off my student loans as fast as I can while living at home with my parents before I even considered moving out on my own. Essentially, I want to pay off my student loans in full in two years, this timeline is very feasible I must add. Personally, I think it's the smartest thing to do so that I'm not paying off interest for 10+ years and carrying that debt with me while i'm trying to settle down with her and start a family. 
 Recently, she's run into some financial troubles and has had to move back in with her parents (who live 1.5 hours away) to find a new job and save money to afford a place of her own again. She's struggling to find a steady job but she has set a goal to afford to move out by mid-2015. She also wants me to move out with her. It's hard to develop our relationship further while we are both living with our parents and she's the one that drives up to see me, she was very clear that she does not want me to visit her because of a rough situation she has with her family (who i've met before and can see why she was clear on this). 
 Since we have both spoken about a future together she's suggesting we start our future sooner rather than later. I'm at a point now where in order to afford to move out, which i'm still not 100% comfortable with because I haven't even started paying off my student loans, then i'll need to find a new job with a steady paycheck. Me not choosing right away to move into a place together has scared her and now she's afraid that i'm wanting to put more focus on my job rather than our relationship. But leaving this job and giving it all up doesn't sound appealing to me, though on the other hand she's the one I want to be with and I don't want to lose her over a job. 
 So now I feel stuck, should I choose to stay with this job and develop myself and my skills in the job field that I love? In the mean time try to work things out with her and show her that i'm still focused on the relationship. Or do I give it up to move in with her so we can start getting more serious about our relationship?",Girlfriend and I are looking to take the next step in our relationship but my job is affecting my decision.

"I am 19F and he is 19M, together for a year and some change. 
 Okay Reddit, here's my problem. Sometimes, when my boyfriend and I are talking about a problem, he will be completely nonconstructive and offensive, drenching every reply in sarcasm. 
 This is what happened today to inspire this post.
Usually, we will text each other throughout the day, not non stop but a few messages here and there. We are looking at apartments and plan on moving in once we have everything sorted out. I was out doing errands and sent him a few pictures of cheap furniture we could use. I got short replies back and asked if it was a bad time, he said no. Later, he found out he was offered a great job and I was very excited to hear the news from him. His joblessness has been stressing him out  a lot  for the past few months and I guess I was a giddy chatterbox because he gave me very short replies. I took the hint and stopped talking to him. 
 A few hours later, I had something separate to ask him. I got the same short replies. Maybe it's selfish, but it put a damper on my mood and I said something a bit passive-aggressive to him. I hadn't planned on mentioning why I was in a bad mood but he asked, and I told him. I said what was on my mind, and I specifically told him that I was just a little miffed, not upset or angry. He says something like ""Here I was thinking an answer was good enough for you, how petty of  me "". I say ""Stop being sarcastic, it's unwarranted. I don't like trying to be serious and I get these remarks"" and try telling him what's wrong again. He says something about what he says not meeting my criteria, and ""I do it your way or I'm in the doghouse, right?"" At this point, my face is red and I feel like I'm not even talking to my boyfriend. I tell him to try and say something constructive and to stop putting words in my mouth. He says ""I'll finish this later"". That's where we are now. He is so sweet otherwise and this is so out of character. It makes me feel small or like a joke. It's his tone and how degrading it is, I usually end up in tears. It's embarrassing.","Boyfriend uses sarcasm as a weapon when we have civil discussions about our issues, turns them into arguments",19,F,relationships
"UPDATE: After reading all the comments and taking the night and morning to think about it I have decided I'm going to sit down with him and tell him the truth. It was arrogant and wrong of me to assume what I did and it was naive of me to act the way I did on it instead of just having a talk with him about it. I'm going to ask him if he would like to be tested and offer to go with him so we can both know. 
 I didn't mean to be deceiving or to seem like I was gambling with something so serious but this is why I love reddit, it puts things into prospective for me and I now see, no matter how high the percentage of infertility is in men with this condition, that it was just wrong and stupid to trust that instead of talking to him about it.

 My SO has a condition which makes him sterile. I don't have a problem with this but the awkward thing is.. I don't think he knows this.

 A couple weeks ago he asked me if I was taking birth control and was honestly worried because he said he never seen me take anything and we don't use condoms. I haven't been on birth control this entire relationship and I -know- there isn't a chance of pregnancy but I'm afraid he doesn't.. 
 I really don't know what to say to him. Do I lie and tell him that I'm on birth control? Do I sit down with him and talk this out? Or should I just avoid it entirely.

"Have you seen the movie The Prestige? Subtract all the magic and murder and focus on the Christian Bale/Rebecca Hall subplot and you have a pretty good idea of how I'm feeling. 
 I've been with my boyfriend for over 6 years. In that time, we've spent 1 year living fairly close to each other, 1 year in a long distance relationship, and 4 years living together. We've lived in 3 different cities during this time because of my grad school. He wanted to move to be with me after our year apart, and I encouraged that idea. 
 I'm not ignorant to his alcoholism. He drinks. I deal. He never gets physically aggressive. Recently I've just been shutting myself in my bedroom when he starts drinking heavily because I know what he's going to say: 
 ""I'm miserable."" 
 ""You've taken me away from my friends."" 
 ""I was doing well before we moved."" 
 ""You don't respect me."" 
 ""You don't appreciate me.""

 I stayed. 
 Which brings us to now. I had to go out of town Thursday-Sunday. Thursday via text message I discovered he had been drinking. Did he even wait for me to pull out of the driveway to do so? That hurt.

"I grew up Mormon from the day I was born until about 3 years ago, I'm 30.  I left my old mormon marriage, two kids, 6 and 7, and live an hour away from them.  That is a hard thing for me, but leaving her was the best thing I ever did, I never loved that woman, I jumped in for religious reason and lost 10 years of my life.  Now I feel so insecure in my new amazing relationship, I find myself jealous that she had her teens and 20's all to her own, to make her own choices, to have more fun in the bedroom, while I floated along living the cookie cutter mormon life to my own mental hell and torment.

I feel like this is causing a lot of my depression, any thoughts?

I'll get so anxious that sex won't 'end' for me, and I'll end up in a pile of unfulfilled frustration and self loathing. 
 I'll take any advice, I've never had depression before, I've heard from a therapist I have RTS, religious trauma syndrome, which fits with my upbringing, but I need to stop self destructing before I ruin the best thing that's ever happened to me.

"So I [26 F] have been dating [29 M] for 6 months. Throughout the entire 6 months, I have been questioning whether or not he is genuinely interested in having a serious relationship with me or if I'm just being strung along. I'm unsure if these are legitimate concerns or if I'm paranoid. We have been exclusive for 5 months and I'm pretty confident he is not seeing anyone else. Here are the main things about our relationship that concern me: 
 &nbsp; 
 *After 6 months of ""dating"", he still hasn't agreed to the whole boyfriend/girlfriend title. I have brought this up multiple times, for the past 4 months he says he's just ""waiting for the right moment to ask"". He says he considers me his girlfriend and refers to me as his girlfriend. 
 &nbsp; 
 *He does not involve me in any social media except for the occasional picture hidden in some large photo album. That's an obvious red flag, but he's in politics and is a private person in general, so perhaps that's just how he is. He has absolutely no pictures of past girlfriends, although he doesn't allow others to tag him in photos so I could be missing a ton of stuff. 
 &nbsp; 
 *He has introduced me to a lot of close friends and even his brother who was visiting from out of town, but not his parents. He has met mine. From what he tells me, I'm pretty sure his parents at least know I exist. But, he knows how important family is to me and this is not exactly where I want to be after 6 months of dating. 
 &nbsp; 
 *He will often open up about his feelings and how much he likes me when he's drinking, but very rarely when he is sober. I'm still not sure if he is honest when he's drunk or when he's sober. After 6 months I think he should be comfortable enough to tell me how he feels or at least show me. There have been no ""I love you's"" yet. But, I tend to not be very open either so perhaps this is hypocritical. 
 &nbsp; 
 The past couple of months especially, I have been feeling like he is not serious about me and is stringing me along. I have already brought this subject up to him multiple times, and every time he assures me that he is into this and really likes me. Then, we are OK for a little bit, but those feelings keep coming back. 
Recently he left for a 10 day trip and was very proactive about calling me and texting me at first, which was great. After a few days, he even told me about a job interview across country, and asked if I'd consider moving there with him if he got the job. After we talked about this, I was SO happy that he finally was showing me how serious he was. But, things started fizzling out, he stopped texting and calling. Because he tends to only show how serious he is about me when he's drinking, I thought that maybe he regretted asking me and wanted to distance himself. So I was very sad and upset, and decided to step back and talk about it when he gets home. 
 &nbsp; 
 I pick him up from the airport and he seems distant, and doesn't really seem excited to see me. I was hoping to go to lunch but he just wanted me to drop him off at home. I ask when I can see him, and he says in a few days after he recovers. A few days?! He had absolutely no plans. Wouldn't you be so excited to finally be back and to see your girlfriend? 
 &nbsp; 
 After this I was pretty much over it. I stopped initiating conversations and making plans. Maybe this was childish, but I'm a stubborn girl and I wanted him to care enough to bring the subject up for a change. So, a few days goes by, and he texts me while I was in an important meeting and asks if we had talked the night before and that he was sorry for any drunk phone calls (I had 4 missed calls from him at 1 am). I said no we did not talk, and then he texts me a little later and basically says that I have been acting distant, and if I didn't want to move with him then I should have been upfront about it and I shouldn't have pretended and blah blah. I texted him back saying that he was wrong and that I was excited, but I was concerned that he was drinking when he asked and then he regretted it after. I also said this isn't the best thing to talk about over text. He responded that I must not have picked up on how excited he was, and I responded that I did and I was excited, but everything else points to him not wanting a serious relationship so I get confused. That was 3 days ago and I haven't heard back from him since. Is he expecting me to reach out? Me being stubborn, I don't want to be the one to do all the work and try to fix this. Honestly, I'm not sure if I really want to. The way he is acting is exactly why I'm questioning his commitment in the first place. 
 &nbsp; 
 Is there a mature way to handle this? Should I reach out to him or should I wait for him to reach out to me?

"I cooked professionally for years. Primarily French fine dining. I loved it. It was a great way to spend my early 20s. Then i joined the Marines for my late 20s. Infantry guy with two tours in Afghanistan. I wouldn't do it again, but I wouldn't trade the experience for anything. 
 Now, I always told myself I would go back to cooking after getting out. But, when it came time I decided that I was tired of working weekends and holidays and getting paid crap. So, now I'm back in school for computer science and trying to get into mobile development. All of my friends are successful, so sometimes it sucks being the one still pretty much living paycheck to paycheck, but I make do. 
 I don't regret any of it. Everything I have done makes me who I am, and I am awesome. The worst of it is dating. It's hard to get out a lot when I have to watch what I'm spending. I'd rather spend that money on a night with friends than on a date where it may end up being terrible. Also, I'm 30 and a lot of women my age are looking for someone who's as far into a career as they are. They don't want to do date a college student. Than want someone who can afford to go out whenever and all that. But, it'll be okay.","I regret letting myself get overweight after getting out of the Marines, and now I'm in the gym trying to fix it.",30,M,AskMen
"The first one that comes to mind is when I was probably ~14 (freshman year of high school).  A few buddies and I had smoked weed at this one kid's house with extremely lax (non-existent) parents and eventually got the munchies.  So we all head off to Subway, marching along knowing that we would have glorious sandwiches before long. 
 As we're walking, I start to feel pretty weird, not anything crazy but just couldn't see particularly well and felt odd in general.  Anyway, we're walking along, probably about 1-2 miles, and by the time we get there, I'm feeling pretty light headed.  So we're in Subway, and I can just feel everyone looking at me like 'wow, what the fuck is up with this guy'.  I go to order, and I immediately realize that I'm not gonna be able to get through this order without slamming face first into the counter.  So what does any reasonable guy do?  I blurt out my whole order in about 2.3 seconds; ""FootlongWhitebreadTurkeyMayoLettuceTomatoSaltPepperOilVinegar"" 
 I gave my friend my money to pay for me, and slunk past some display and just laid on the bench for what felt like an eternity.  It was during this time of reflection that I realized, wow, I am way too fucking high for this shit. I eventually pulled myself up and scarfed down that sandwich in about three bites...leaving the Subway in a state of confusion as to what was up with that 14 year old who orders he sandwich like a damn auctioneer.","Went to Subway high as shit, had to recuperate between ordering and eating

"I (21m) am getting upset about the fact that she (21f) is still hanging out with her exes. We have been dating for a 2 months. She justifies it by saying that these guys are her friends. One of these guys she was in a one year relationship with and the other she had been hooking up with in a friends with benefits kind of deal for the last year until she met me. 
 She has not yet even told them that we are in a relationship. I asked her if she thought them knowing would change the dynamics of their relationship, and she said it probably would.
With the first guy, she says when they went out it was more like they were friends or family then bf and gf. They get dinner and lunches time to time and she usually says its with ""a friend"" instead of tell me that it's him. I find out later only by chance. 
 The second guy she has been friends with for the past two years. She has since ""ended it"" with him but after an initial falling out where he told all their mutual friends that she caused him pain and angst and blamed it all on her, they are friends again. He is part of her main friend group and they party and hang out all the time. 
 Her being friends with them is not what bothers me. It's the fact that it seems sometimes like she is hiding it from me and me from them. Also when we are hanging out, she is texting them and they have no clue that I am with her. 
 I'm scared that my feelings of something being off comes from immaturity and jealousy, but I still am wary of these other guys who have a lot of history with her. I am trying to be open about my feelings with her and communicating.

"15 years. 15 years (to be exact, 14 years and 10 months) ago I started the way towards my dream. Have you met a kid, who doesn't dream big? They all do. And so did I. With idols such as Martin Brodeur, Dominik Hašek and Patrick Roy, I dreamt of the highest things. And, decided to be a goalie. 
 I was tiny, so I wasn't really the greatest at time. Nor was I ever. Yet, around 06-07 I got to play a lot, as I had nobody behind or in front of me. Then someone bigger came along. 
 In 08, KHL was created and with it, a team in my country. Being 13, I sorta realized that I'm not going to reach the peak of dreams. I had to refocus on being best I could be and try to reach local KHL team. A long way, but in 09 junior system was created and it didn't seem too impossible.. Then I was told I was not tall enough. 20cm was the difference between me and two other guys. I was told I had great work ethic, etc, etc, but I had no shot at getting ice time. I did, tho... 10 minutes, 2 goals. 2 months later I was diagnosed with Osgood-Schlatter. 
 3 years spent in depression, contemplating life choices and all. In '12 I got on ice with amateurs. Ice was in my veins and I just couldn't live without hockey. I immediately got better. In late 2013, small team 100km away from country's capital was looking for players to join, as otherwise it would get dsq for not being able to gather enough players for games. 
 I played half season, team lost all 24 games, but I fucking loved being there. 2014 and I thought of going to Denmark to study, to try to find a team and play.. I pussied out. I was afraid that my depression would come back.  In late  summer of 2014 there was a decision to create a 1st league, where players under20 and, those who can't reach highest league, would play. It gave me another year. I had an amazing run from December till late '15 January, until.. Thorn knee. Bunch of doctors, MRI's, xrays, taping.. Nightmare for 3 months, nothing exact, no concrete diagnose. A procedure in June and another start of season in late autumn. A terrible first game, and I didn't see ice until end of November. 2days, 2 games, 2 wins.. And another 3 games in next 6 days. No backup, no power, 3 loses and afterwards I was back on bench until end of January. A lose. And no ice time once again. With last home game in this season today, I have decided to hang the skates.","nobody ends his hockey career, nobody cares, gl&hf.",21,M,hockeyplayers
"Hello Dear friends, first thing I have to say is that I’m a superfan of this thread and can happily say 99% of my reddit browsing is devoted to this and r/justneckbeardthings. What makes everything so real is that I have come across a couple of neck-necks in my life, one in particular so I’d thought I’d share. 
 Me: An average 12 year old girl at the time (Slightly above Normal grades, average looks, very lucky to be blessed with many amazing friends and fun art classes)
Jack: “popular boy” and shitstirrer, he sounds like a toss in this but I promise he isn’t that bad just a regular immature 12year old boy
Canckles: our residential NB he was only 12 at the time but already had many NB tendencies, particularly thinking he was super smart and also very mean to anyone he thought was a “dumb”. 
 Canckles was indeed a well rounded boy physically. He was a little bit bullied apparently in his primary school for his fuller figure but not too badly. He ended up being incredibly defensive and quite vindictive and nasty. I presume he used it like a defensive mechanism, rather like “If I’m mean to you first, then your attacks wont hurt” kind of thing. Apart from that he had classic nb tendencies including superiority complex, deep rooted misogyny, nerdy hobbies and he was of course an atheist. 
 One day in year 7 art class our art teacher had us make some form of clay sculptures. As we were incredibly immature 12 year olds we were messy and all playing around with the clay. 2 of the popular boys aka future chads decided it would be funny to steal one of Canckles book, he knew it was them immediately though as they had been doing it to other members of the class. He then began hurling lumps of clay at one of them, we shall call Jack. Jack had been a bit of a trouble maker in the class so no one really paid attention. Until I hear a yell and turn to see Canckles had grabbed a hold of jacks shirt and was trying to hit him. Canckles went to tae kwon do (he was later kicked out) and by the looks of things was trying to use some of these moves on Jack. The teacher however pulled him aside before things could escalate. Canckles however in a rage tore away from the teacher and grabbed some clay on the nearby table and hurled it full force towards Jack. Unfortunately it missed it’s target and slammed straight into the person inbetween. Yep. Lucky guess, that clay smacked right into my forearm. I did scream in pain, however that did stop canckles he continued to hurl further clay projectiles at Jack. Jack decided it would be a good idea to just ran straight out the back of the room. He fled through the doors with canckles hot on his trail (well a bit behind considering jack was a stick insect at the time). Jack turned right and ran straight from the art block onto the grass oval. Canckles in the mean time turned and pulled (I shit you not) an old loose brick from the  pavement and hurled it at Jack. Considering that Jack was a lot faster he was able to dodge it. Canckles then picked up another brick and just started chasing Jack down.  Now this must have been a sight to behold, Jack running full bore yelling “CALM DOWN CANCKLES WHAT THE FUCK” followed by, (at this point power walking) canckles with brick in hand. Followed by our entire art class screaming and lastly our art teacher trailing behind. After a couple minutes of running around on the oval Canckles now completely out of breath hurled the brick at Jack but it missed by a long shot. Jack then ran straight back toward the classrooms whilst Canckles realising that the teacher was catching up and screaming at him, fled in the opposite direction outside the school gates. We all followed Jack to see if he was okay and were genuinely in shock over the whole incident. 
 The teacher went after canckles and found him sitting in the dry creek bed in front of our school before getting the principal and calling his parents. 
 In the end Jack was fine and my arm healed after a couple days. Canckles however ended up getting suspended, getting kicked out of his martial arts club (apparently your only supposed to use it in self defence not kicking 12 year olds) and becoming one of the most hated kids in our grade. 
 Please let me know if you want to know more about Canckles. I have plenty more stories over our entire 6 year highschool together.","NB gets a book hidden from him in class, violently overreacts and goes on rampage with clay and then bricks to seek vengeance on attacker.

"Both 20 years old, he's a virgin, I've been with 2 guys previously (one was my first and a year-and-some-change long relationship, the other was an old friend, a drunken hook-up after ending the previously mentioned relationship) 
 I'll try to keep this as concise as possible. I met this fantastic guy back in late September/early October. We immediately hit it off, started spending a lot of time together, just getting to know each other. It's slowly evolved into a very honest, intimate relationship. One of the first nights we spent together, things were getting a little heated between the sheets, and he felt compelled to admit to me that he was still a virgin, that sex (not for moral or religious reasons, but more personal values) was something that he'd planned to save until he met a girl he felt very strongly for. Over the next couple months, the implication has been that I could be that girl. 
 There is a ton of sexual energy between us. The fact that he's a virgin is actually a complete turn-on for me. This may seem like a no-brainer to some, but I really am unsure how to respectfully move towards, or at least bring up the topic of, having sex. I'm not in any rush, if it didn't happen for another year I wouldn't bat an eyelash, but my senses are telling me that that's not what either of us is thinking. But, due to the fact that I'm the one with more experience, I feel as though I should be the one to ""take the reigns"", so to speak. I've never been in this situation before, but I'm completely willing to step outside my comfort zone. Part of me is wary of being a bit presumptuous, which is why I don't just want to ""go for it"". How do I know he's positive he wants me to take his virginity? Clearly it means something to him. 
 Also, recently (as in, within the past 3-4 weeks), we met up to have a little talk late one night. The overall message was that he was very much interested in pursuing what we had going, but that he also needed a little space, that the physical aspect of our relationship was a little ""too much"" for him at the time, and that he also needed a little more space for personal time. I understand this, he's a very busy person, and I also am one to need down time to just space out and not have to focus on anyone in particular. The conversation ended very positively, and I felt (as with many discussions we've had) even closer to him. 
 The more I thought about what he said about the physical though, the more I began to wonder if he had other motives he didn't want to state. We had not long before that moved into performing oral on each other. Whenever I would go down on him though, he had trouble lasting more than, say, a minute. Could that be what he meant by ""too much""? Because, recently, things have moved back into getting more physical. Of course I've asked if he's okay with things, and he definitely has been, but suddenly he's lasting so much longer. Could this have to do with why he wanted space? Because now he seems much more motivated to be more sexual with each other. Regardless, with this discussion in mind, I'm wary of moving faster than he wants to at this time in his life. 
 I don't want to rush anything, and part of me thinks it'll just feel right when it's the right time. But even when that time comes, do any of you have advice on what to say, or what to do? He and I have established such openness between us that I'm not so much concerned about actually being able to talk to him, just how to say it. And I apologize for the length!","20 yr. old girl seeing 20 yr. old guy who's a virgin (by choice), unsure of how to approach the topic of having sex.",20,F,sex
"So, a few years ago I decided to drop everything to become a dj/producer double threat and take the world by storm. I left my home town to work two full-time jobs(Over  100 hours per week ) and take music courses online. ( I was also my own manager, I suppose that counts as another part time job.) 
 Long story short, I took on  way  too much, and after two years (a week ago) I crashed, hard.

"I actually guessed so, but didn't want to assume ;)

"New to this, so bear with me in regard to any formatting oddities. 
 I met my girlfriend, call her Vivian, almost two years ago. We hit it off and started dating at the end of the year after I told her how I felt about her. 
 Things were great, but not without faults. A few months into the relationship we regularly started fighting over trivial things that we let get blown out of proportion. I have grown a lot as a person from this. I've become more respectful toward people's differing views, and become more emotionally accommodating not only to her but to all. Despite this, even in recent times, we have had the same kind of fights more times than I care to admit, due to both of us being stubborn and prideful when we feel disrespected. 
 I should mention a few things at this point. My girlfriend has depression. Apparently she's felt depressed for as long as she can remember, but a few months ago it became worse. She bit off too much work to chew (part time job, full time student with almost maximum possible units with TWO upper division math courses along with a lot of biology, and volunteering at two hospitals simultaneously) and ended up failing two courses, which is awful for her since she's been a straight A student her whole life.
She recently started seeing a counselor but she's said that it makes her feel uncomfortable opening up to people about her problems, but she's making an effort to get better. She says it makes her sad to see other people be happy like her counselor because she can't be, no matter how hard she tries. 
 Secondly, while Vivian had a high libido when we started dating, it has declined severely for the majority of our relationship. Additionally, she wanted to wait 7 months from when we started dating before we could have sex. I appreciate waiting to make sure you really love someone before having sex, but to me this still seemed far too long a period. Regardless, I decided to wait for her and compromised. Eventually, 7 months came and she still wasn't into it. I asked a month after that, still nothing. She would give me a different reason every time I asked why she didn't want to have sex. ""I just want to enjoy where we are right now a little bit longer"", ""I don't want to think of what my mother would say if she knew I was having sex"". Ultimately she wasn't ready and I was really disappointed and felt like she wasn't all that invested into the relationship as a result, and it has affected my self-esteem. Eventually her sex drive all but disappeared when her depression worsened, and I feel shitty for even thinking this way because I know she can't help it, but I feel led on. Note: we have had oral and hand sex since about a month into our relationship. What she is not ready for is penetrative sex. 
 On the topic of her depression and in general, I see myself as very supportive. I have driven down to her place to be there for her on multiple occasions (which is a big deal because it's at least an hour drive with good traffic), I'm often thinking about what more I can do for her, I go to her house just to be with her when she's feeling down if only to hold her hand and tell her I love her, I buy her flowers without occasion. She's praised me for how sweet I am a lot through our relationship, so I'd like to think I am generally a good partner. For as long as I've wanted a relationship with someone, I've tried to grow myself into what I consider to be a supportive and affectionate lover. 
 We had a rough few months up until the beginning of March, and we were finally back on a smooth course.. or so I thought. Last night we had a typical thick-headed argument and long story short, she broke up with me. It was a very impulsive, sobering decision. As soon as she said it I dropped everything we were arguing over and told her that if this was really the end, I wanted it to not end so horribly, but she just kept insulting me and telling me how a terrible and unsupportive boyfriend I am. This blind-sided me. I've been very open with my communication toward her and she's been very busy with class this quarter, but when we see each other once or twice a week, things are amazing. She said she's tired of having the same arguments and that she appreciates all of my efforts but she can't handle the same mistakes being repeated so many times (stubbornness leading to arguments mostly, though this is definitely an issue we both have). I'm so distraught. I've grown so much not just for her but to be a better person and I've always put her at the top of my priorities and given her everything I have to support her through any trouble she has. Is that not enough? Is it really so terrible that we're mutually assholes to each other now and then? I always apologize profusely for my mistakes. Most of the times I apologize to her, I end up in tears because I hate letting her down in the slightest. 
 I'm so confused. I've felt emotionally and physically unsatisfied with this relationship for a good while, and despite this as well as being told I put up with too much immature behavior on her part by multiple friends I love her. I don't want it to end. We spoke more from around 2:00 AM to 6:00 AM. We both don't want it to be over, but she really doesn't know if we can get through this. She says she love me and doesn't want us to be over, but doesn't miss me. She proposed that we make lists of all of the things we do not like about each other, then talk about it when I go to pick up my things from her house later this week.",girlfriend broke up with me over a stupid game because we are both hard-headed and a bit disrespectful toward each other when frustrated.

"I'm F (19), he's M (19). We started dating when we were 16, broke up last May when we were both 18. First love, first relationship, all that jazz. He was my best friend. We went through everything together. 
 Unfortunately a few months in I developed anorexia, and we had a really unhealthy, co-dependent relationship. He ignored his problems for too long and he had a breakdown. He was diagnosed as bipolar and depressed, and he broke up with me because we were both way too fucked up to be in a relationship. 
 I moved away for school, relapsed hard and moved home to the town we both live in. I am doing much, much, MUCH better right now with regards to the eating disorder - weight-restored, eating regularly, etc etc. I still struggle with depression and the ED might always be there (I hope not though), but I'm ten times better than when he broke up with me. 
 He is not doing as well unfortunately. He's really into drugs right now and is drinking heavily. I have missed him so much and I know he misses me (mutual friends told me so). Neither of us have done more than drunkenly made out with someone else in the ten months since we've broken up. I have never stopped loving him. 
 We met up yesterday to talk and catch up and see if we could start being friends again. It was so easy and natural to talk with him. The last thing he said to me was, ""I'll see you soon"" and he gave me a big smile. I know he was happy to see me. 
 Is is possible to make this work or is it doomed? My eating disorder really, really fucked up our relationship, but he had his own issues as well.

"My girlfriend and I started dating from different high schools, and we knew each through mutual friends. Our relationship became much bigger than I think both of us imagined it being. Our personalities were very different, yet clashed so well. We would see each other once a week on average, normally during the weekend because we lived about 45 minutes away from each other. Our relationship was everything that a high school relationship could be. We loved laughing together, we were passionate, going to church together, and even both agreed on believing in saving intercourse until marriage. 
 We have been through a lot together. She was the person who I went to the most when my mother passed away when I was 17, and I was the person she talked to the most when she was having troubles among her family. 
 In a nutshell, our relationship was perfect. Now, we are freshmen going to the same college. We now live a 30 second walk from each other and see each other every day at practice. She spends much more time than me doing schoolwork, and traveling for our sports team at our college. Since we have been here, she has not quite acted the same. We never went on dates as often as we used to in high school (despite only having one once a week), she is not as passionate with me anymore (haven't hooked up since the summer... it is now March 12.. again something that we both enjoyed that we did weekly), and all it seemed is for me to buy her dinner and then drop her off for her to go to bed. 
 The point is, the past 8 months in our relationship has not been the same as it has been. I assume it has been a huge culture shock for us since we aren't used to seeing each other every day. Three weeks ago, she sat me down and admitted that she felt obligated to hang out with me because we were dating and was not sure if she wanted to be as committed with me. She wanted to take a break and stay away from each other to see how it went, and to see if we really loved each other. 
 I feel that we are on two completely separate pages. The past three weeks for me have been miserable. I see her every day, and takes all that I have not to talk to her. This definitely confirmed for me that I know I love this girl. I asked her last week how it was going with her and she said she wants it to keep going since she has been caught up with schoolwork and has not relaxed at all. 
 I want to get back together with her so bad. I miss her so much, but at the same time, this girl needs a few weeks to see if she needs me or not. So I feel like my feelings for her are stronger than hers are for me. 
 I know I know.. I am in college and we are young. There are 20,000 other girls on this campus, many of them being very attractive, but being around this many good looking girls make you realized that there are few REAL quality girls.

The coffee ""date"" went great, so she agreed to hang out again. Last night she drove down here and we hung out at the mall for a couple of hours, and again, it went great. Conversation was flowing, she was laughing, I was laughing, and we had a great time. So far we've only really hung out with each other those 2 times. 
 So, I've always been really horribly bad at picking up on signals as to whether a girl likes me as a romantic/sexual interest or not. I've dated plenty of girls, but they've always had to make it painfully obvious or just outright tell me they were interested in me for me to make a move, otherwise I would be completely oblivious. 
 I don't know whether she's interested in me as a romantic interest or not. I just know that we've hung out twice by ourselves, we text each other a lot, she initiates conversations with me as often as I initiate conversations with her, it's easy for me to make her laugh, and she wants to hang out again soon we just haven't figured out what day yet because of her work schedule. 
 I'm genuinely interested in this girl and I want to take things further with her. The thing is, neither of us have been really touchy-feely with each other and I don't know what the most comfortable way to make the first move would be. I feel like finding the opportunity to kiss her would be really difficult to do naturally, and it'd be something I'd have to direct which I feel like may make it awkward and uncomfortable and ruin the whole thing. Would it be better to try holding her hand first, putting my arm around her ever once in a while when we sit down, or are those too ""middle-school""? Or should I just somehow let her know of my intentions, since I may have not made them clear other than dropping hints that I find her attractive?","I've hung out with this girl twice and I'm interested in taking things further, but I have no idea if she only sees me as a friend or if she really sees me as a romantic interest. I figured the only way to find out for sure is to make the first move, but neither of us have been touchy-feely with each other and I feel like just outright trying to kiss her would make her really uncomfortable with me and put her off completely. Would it better to make my intentions clear before doing any of this somehow?

I dated a guy for 5 years.  He was 6 years older than me and we met when I was 16 (should have sent up a red flag right there).  He was actually fairly normal for the majority of our relationship until I started going to college.  I commuted and I lived with him.  I was not allowed to make any friends on campus (including female friends).  I was only allowed to be friends with his friends and only hang out with them when he was around.  One day about a month before we broke up I started suspecting that he was cheating on me with a girl from his work (he was...).   He freaked out on me and when I went to walk out of the room he grabbed my arm and wouldn't let me go.  I was hysterically crying and asking him repeatedly to let me go.  When he didn't let me go I hit him open handed on the shoulder.  He let me go but then came behind me and held my arms down and drug me to the bed and held me still.  I got away and he apologized over and over.  I forgave him.  Over the next few weeks he would bring it up occasionally and he progressively started to defend himself and say that he was in the right and that he did nothing wrong.  I broke it off with him shortly after that started.  We still kept in contact and I thought about getting back together with him but I realized how much happier I was with him not around.  The day after Christmas (over 2 months after we broke up... and we were hardly talking at that point).  He shows up at my house with a bad full of presents and an engagment ring.  I wasn't really sure how to react so I listened to him for a while.  When I told him that I didn't think it was a good idea to get back with him and that we should go our seperate ways because we were in different points of our lives (I was 21 and he was 27 turning 28) he flipped out again and started pacing back and forth across the room with his fists clenched and looking like he was going to hit me.  I kicked him out of my house.  I haven't heard from him since however my mom heard that he got engaged to the girl that he cheated on me with a month after he tried to propose to me.  Best decision I have ever made was getting out of that while I still could.,My ex-boyfriend of 5 years physically and emotionally abused me and then tried to propose to me over 2 months after I broke up with him.

"About two months ago, I (21F) went with a group of my friends/ housemates to celebrate Mardi Gras. At the end of the night I ended up in my neighbor's bed (20M); we eventually fell into a FWB situation and started spending time together on and off until about two weeks ago. I slept with someone else, as we had not made any sort of official commitment to each other, and quite frankly, I didn't really think he was all that into me. The night before this happened, he commented on how he was so bored whenever he was hanging out with me. Kinda hurt to hear that. I mean, nobody intends to be perceived as boring. But we don't really have alot of core interests in common, so it wasn't a huge surprise. 
 I texted him yesterday seeing if he wanted to catch up sometime this week and he responded with a resounding ""no"". Clearly he wants nothing to do with me, and I suppose I can deal with that.

"26, M, 140 pounds, 5'7. 
 Here's my original post. 
 Long story short I had a lump in my neck from a swollen lymph node. Turned out I had a mild case of mono. 
 ANYWAY, the doctor ran a bunch of blood tests on me and I ended up testing slightly positive (as he put it) for Hep C antibodies. He was concerned and so he ran a ""Confirmatory test"" as he put it and that came back negative. He now wants to send me to a specialist to confirm my results but it sounds like to me I don't have it and that this was a false positive test. I'm not sure what the point of going to a specialist is other than being overly cautious. 
 The only possible way I could have gotten hep c is sex. I have no tatoos, piercings, have never done any drugs and I am not a vampire. So any advice here?

"This is exhausting. Writing about it is exhausting. I know that people say you can't ever give up, and believing that you can will ensure that you will, but the fact is that I've been trying to lose weight for 16 years and I think I'm out of options, except weight loss drugs and weight loss surgery. Maybe you have some ideas? 
 I have some brain damage from a head injury that I think contributes to impulse control element of binge eating. 
 Right now, I feel a little bit hungry. Intuitive eating would say that I should go downstairs and eat a hunger-proportional healthy snack. But I'm afraid that what will happen is I will go downstairs and eat everything in sight. I did that last night, and I've done that for the past three nights in a row. 
 Currently I'm at 290, and I've been on the increase since Christmas when I was 273. I honestly don't know how much I should weigh, because I didn't keep careful track of my weight when I didn't look fat. When I started getting fat, I remember the number 230 popping into my head, and that steadily increasing. I struggled to stay 230, and that failed over time. Then I was 280 for what felt like a long time. The heaviest I've ever been was 326, and at that point I had trouble moving around and experienced abdominal and back pain. Generally if I stay below 300 I don't have motion problems. But it's been up and down since I was 22. 
 I don't even know what to shoot for -- just ""as much as possible"" would be a good amount of weight to lose. The BMI calculator tells me I should weigh 195 maximum, but I've heard that the BMI was developed in the 19th century and that people are bigger now. I dunno...the lightest I've been since I started struggling with my weight was 210, and I was lifting weights somewhat obsessively then and eating really minimally. It was nothing I could sustain. 
 So: what should I do? Calorie counting? Intuitive eating? Some combination? I need to solve this! I can't live my life fat. I won't. 
 And this is maybe most important: is there anything I can do about binge eating? I have powerful brain compulsions to eat lots of food, and I feel like I have no power to stop myself from walking downstairs to get a dish of ice cream (I live with my parents, and they keep goodies in the house -- I can't ask them to get rid of all their food). As I write this, my hunger is growing. I don't know what to do. I gave up on love and romance for the time being, which was a good decision, but I'm worried about my health and just general social acceptance (including getting hired in the medical field, which is what I'm in school for). 
 I don't want to be fat anymore! Do I have to be fat? I don't know what to do. I've considered suicide because of this...I know how silly it would look on a suicide note to say ""I couldn't lose weight"", but I don't think some people understand how frustrating it can be. Everyone must understand how awful it is to be fat in contemporary America.

"It was at my Secondary school. Aged 14-16. I didn't have many dependable friends then. But during these final 3 years, I had a friend whom shall be named ""John.""
John was in a similar situation as me, but he lived in a village quite far from my town where the school was, so we never saw each other that summer. He also always treated me like shit to make himself more accepting to other schoolmates. I being a naive, wiener went along with this through the last 3 years of Secondary school, I got pissed but I utterly let it go out of it being ""Witty Banter"", a commonly man-thing to do. Then after that final year, three things hit me: 
 
 He was bullying me/treating me like his bitch. 
 Like me, he didn't have any actual friends apart from one, naive me. 
 He's going to be miserably alone this summer. 
 
 All through the summer, he proceeded to tell me through MSN that: 
 
 I've been his only trustworthy friend. 
 His foot fetish 
 His wanking habits and problems with wanking privacy in regards to his family 
 Infatuations about the girls in our year and his fantasies of what he would do to said women. 
 How he's miserable and alone. 
 Most hilarious of them all, his foreskin is stuck on his bellend and he was considering a circumcision. 
 
 After all this 3 year crap he put me through, I decided it was his turn.
About halfway during the summer holidays, he tells me through MSN that would be somewhere else for a few days, with no computer access and proceeded to ask me for advice on wanking while in proximity of his mother and younger sister at this place. I gave him some cliche advice and off he went. 
 Time to play MSN ""hacker"" by guessing his password at 1 in the morning. Luckily he's a bit of a technophobe and put his MSN username as his password. This was the gateway to all things sweet and delicious. Here's the list and what happened with each: 
 
 His MSN obviously. Did nothing on that, I continued to use this when he went to bed at 10-11PM after he came back. 
 Youtube. Deleted that sumbitch ASAP. 
 Facebook. Juiciest part of all. Those fantasies he told me about? I thought I'd like to share these thoughts to each, individual ""Friend"" he had on there, resulting in blocks and the sort. All while Role-playing as John. 
 
 When John gets back from his break?, he finds out about what ""he"" said to these girls and claim he was hacked via status update. He then came straight to me to ask me about what has happened these past few days. I claim not [to have anything to do with it.] ( He believes me. I mean, why wouldn't he? I'm his only  trustworthy  friend of course! As a result, he creates another MSN account. But makes the same mistake of having his username, his password. And the next couple of weeks and e-mail addresses he goes through, I just tell all these girls and boys (Including me) on his Facebook how I would like to: 
 
 Spray his load onto their feet. (John's Actual Fantasy. Shortened to JAF.) 
 Trim their lady garden with my teeth. (Made up.)   
 Lick them up in his house. Alone. (JAF.) 
 Watch them and another girl trib while simultaneously jerking him off. (JAF.) 
 Watch 2 Girls, 1 Cup with her. (Made up.) 
 Tie them up with his bedsheets to his bed in his house. Alone... (JAF.) 
 
 He eventually calls the ""hacker"" out via Facebook status... Saying he won't be made a mockery of. He gets a few ""Likes"" and comments saying ""Oh John, we know it's just you expressing yourself and you should be okay with that.""
While this was going on, I stopped as it was getting towards September and wrote an appeal to go to a better college someplace else. 
 So summer is over and so begins College. Our Secondary school has a college block, so same place, I haven't received a reply from the other college yet. First thing he says to me ""ARE YOU THE HACKER?!"" I claim not to be ""THE HACKER"" and began our induction. On the 3rd of  Christmas  college, I get a phonecall from my college I applied to, asking if I could come to an induction day the next day, while John being a nosy bastard, trying to listen in to my conversation. I agreed to go to this college and thanked them. I then told John.
""You know when I said I wasn't the hacker a few days ago? [I lied.] ( I then resigned from that college, went home and prepared to go to this new college. Because I hated John and how these tiny college block sucked balls and when a presentation of the Biology objective through these two years was to have ""Have fun :)"", you know it's going to be boring as shit. 
 I didn't think this would be so long, if you read the above, thank you for your time. I hope it wasn't too draining.","John was treating me like his bitch in Secondary school, so I made sure he never got with any bitch in his school life via guessing his MSN password at 1 in the morning, which was connected to all his social media.

"18 year old blonde Australian girl on holiday by herself in NYC.
First day/night in NYC and I had just bought a new jacket (sorry, sweater or coat to Americans ;) and I told the guy helping me I need it to be really warm since i'll be going up to Duluth in MN. 
 It was dark by the time I left the store. I stopped at the first block and I heard someone right in my ear ask if my jacket was warm enough, I looked in shock and saw a darker coloured man right in my space bubble over my left shoulder trying to shake my hand.
I ignored him and kept walking. 
 A block or two down a black car pulls up on the side of the road and the same guy gets out.
I start backing away and he tells me not to worry, it's NYC and there's police everywhere, and besides 'he IS police', and he pulls out his wallet with a badge thing, he 'just happens to be attracted to young blonde Australian girls.' 
 I had never said anything to him yet, theres no way he would have known I was from Australia or to ask if my jacket was warm enough without watching me in that shop first. 
 I didnt look down at the badge, (have done martial arts my whole life, instincts kicked in and didn't fall for any distractions) kept trying to push past him. 
 He kept following me with his hand out trying to shake mine for some reason, and kept asking me questions right in my personal space. 
 He followed for a couple blocks, until I realised ignoring him wasn't working so I turned to him and said something along the lines of ""If you do not leave me alone right now so help me god I will scream bloody murder and every cop from here to central park will come running.""
I kept walking and looked a couple of seconds later and he was no where to be seen, and I saw the car quickly take off from the side of the road. 
 I didn't know weather to go back to my hostel incase he was still following me but I didn't want to stay out either. 
I just walked really quickly and forcefully back and didn't go out the next day, haha.","18, overseas and by myself in NYC, black guy watched me in a shop, followed me down the street, then pulled over in a car and got out coming towards me claimed he was a police officer and kept trying to get me to shake his hand for some reason, followed me some more before I told him i'd scream bloody murder and he disappeared in a hurry.

"Recently I've gotten into a relationship with a new coworker who moved up to my hometown. He was in desperate need for money, so he became a dishwasher. The reason he came up here was to fight wildfires. He's actually leaving out today to go do that for two weeks. 
I'm leaving for college in a month. My priorities have been and remain to be set on getting my degree. I was absolutely not planning on being in a relationship with anyone. But when someone comes along that treats you very nice and well, and you have a TON in common? I'm sorry, but my natural instinct was to kinda go for it. Not to mention he's pretty handy and a very hard worker. (Three jobs to get by while he's waiting for a fire.)
My parents are livid, and I think they are rightfully so. He wanted to meet them? They declined. My dad keeps calling him the dishwasher, and whenever I ask my mom if I can go hang out, she barrs her teeth at me and talks about 'responsibility' and 'priorities'
I've told him IN FULL how my parents feel about the situation. He told me that he doesn't care that I'm going to college. He wants to continue seeing me. If my grades slip, he told me that I would not be seeing him often. He said that college is my ultimate goal and he respects that and he wants me to succeed. 
I'm getting to know him. My parents say I barely know him and I'm making poor judgement and he could be looking for a free ride. Yeah, working three jobs? And he NEVER let's me pick up my wallet when we go out. And I know he's been struggling since he moved here. 
I'm sorry, maybe my vision is skewed and I'm like my parents say, I'm not looking at it rationally and I'm 'doughy eyed' and I have absolutely no clue about him? I'm getting to know him though. 
Not only that? Fun fact: one time my sister slept in for church, they thought that he came to her apartment and killed her. She and I thought it was funny. They were completely serious. 
I know it's their job to be worried about me and what not, they're my parents. But I don't know if I'm the crazy one or they are. 
I have enough money saved up to buy a car and to pay for my first year (whatever isn't covered by scholarships and loans.)
I've wanted to pay on my own all year, and suddenly my dad brings up getting a tax return if he pays me $4,000 a year? 
And the car. I could easily pay for it. And he wanted me to slowly buy it on my own, he just came into my room about 40 minutes ago (6:30 AM) and said maybe it was in my best interest to not pay for the car and to let him pay for it. Then he talked about my college and how I was the families' investment. And how I shouldn't switch my major. (I might have too, engineering is crazy and I like other things too.) 
He made me agree to give him a mileage report once a week, to know for sure that I'm not fucking around. 
A mileage report, once a week. I'm 18, and I'm trying to leave the nest into the wide unknown world, and I thought I would be free of the leash, even in just the slightest bit. But I guess not! 
And shouldn't I be learning my own lessons? If this doesn't end up like I want it to I can learn how to rectify it on my own and I personally think that's a valuable life skill, to fuck up and learn from it. And I only keep fucking up because of the tight leash and I want to go experience things (I'm sorry for wanting to be a fucking teenager and rebel and go hang out with people I like before I leave). I don't smoke. I don't drink. I don't party. I don't like being out past daytime. I'm never with someone who doesn't respect my boundaries and my personal views. Yet I'm constantly reminded on how I fuck up, when I do, and how to avoid it. 
I don't think it's right, and I don't think it's fair. I don't think they should hold anything over my head. It's cruel, to be completely honest. 
I know I'm their little girl and they're worried about me, they only want me to succeed. If they weren't worried I would be concerned. I don't know. Maybe I'm the crazy one? I would like a second opinion. I've told the boy of interest everything that I've written here. I'm just waiting for a response. He told me before we were going to prove them wrong, and send them grade reports regularly. Things just got a little more difficult. I've never felt this happy in my life, and I don't think my happiness is a mistake. And I can tell you, honestly, that whenever something comes along that makes me happy, it gets smashed with the paranoid (nothing is what it seems, be careful, you're irresponsible, yada yada)
I try to talk to them about it, and all of a sudden, when I make a valid argument, I'm manipulating them. I don't want to make any brash decisions here to get a point across. I just want to know if I'm being crazy or if they're right about this. 
It's really bugging the shit out of me. 
They discourage me from dating all together to focus on school. I think personally that I should learn to do things on my own without a leash.

 In terms of my ending goal, I would like to be comfortable and happy with myself. In the short term, I would settle for dropping 5lb and just having more energy to do  anything.  (If you're a numbers person, I should be about 200lb which means I need to lose about 1/2 of me...).

"So, me and the lady friend are very serious - it's not so much an ""if"" we are going to get married, but a when. However, she is currently overseas on scholarship, and returning to (finally!) live with me next summer while I slave away in graduate school. We spent a year living together already and it worked out fantastic, so the ""don't get engaged until you live closer together"" potential advice need not apply. The relationship is healthy. But then I start to get a little murky. 
 I've been thinking about popping the question forever now. She's said she does not care when, where, or how we get engaged, or even if the ring is a super-quality one (""I will definitely want one, but we can wait until we are both together and get on our feet."" Awesome. And she will get the best.) But usually the conversation will turn into ""I'd say yes, but what's the rush? We aren't religious, and already are faithful to each other, a marriage will just be for tax purposes and extra jewelry."" 
 But for me, there is a sort of rush. She is flying back to finish up the last 6 months of her scholarship, and I really wish I could just revel in the fact that this girl I love is my fiance, and not ""girlfriend"", which makes me feel like a 16 year old (no offense..) when I talk about her to people in my program/department/etc. Semantics, but.
Also, I am fortunate enough that I have my grandparents around. However, they have each had strokes in the last 3 years, and it has really been looking bleak - I came home from school for break, and it's just much worse than I thought it could be. Barring past family issues, I owe a lot of any success or happiness I had a chance to ever achieve to them - they are incredibly important to me, and I would really like for them to see their grandson get engaged, if not married at least. 
 But is this fair to her? She says she is ready, but maybe just getting engaged for my own personal vocabulary change and my aging grandparent's aren't the right reasons (though the right reasons are definitely there - I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else.

"The Situation 
 
 I’m in the 2nd year of my university degree, which is an unusually small cohort (there’s about 100 of us in one year). 
 I’m not excessively sociable, so even while the cohort is fairly small, I only got to know a handful of people well in the first year. This second year has been far more fruitful in terms of friendship – for more than just me; everyone has come together to a larger degree, and there’s a lovely burgeoning camaraderie between us all. 
 One person I got to know this year was this girl who I’d only previously known of as  ‘another person in the class’.  We’d been invited by a mutual friend to hang out, but said mutual friend couldn’t make it, and we ended up going along together and actually talking in depth for the first time. That was sometime in September. 
 Since then, seeing her at university, with friends and occasionally hanging out one on one has seen me drift into that precarious position of being quite enamoured with her. 
 I hesitated to call her ‘shy’ in the title, because she isn’t necessarily quiet or aloof. She is however extremely self-effacing and humble, to the point where I almost feel she has elements of an inferiority complex. I think she’s tremendously talented and quirky, and exceedingly kind and thoughtful and loyal, but she would vehemently disagree. She’s also extremely busy, rarely having a free day what with her multiple jobs and family commitments. 
 I really like her and enjoy spending time with her. 
 
 The Question 
 
 At the moment, I’ve convinced myself I need to let her know, predominately because I feel I’d prefer to live in a universe in which my ‘What if?’ question was definitively answered, rather than secretly wrestling with it unanswered. 
 My qualms are myriad though. I don’t think she feels any romantic interest for me. She’s fairly secretive, and doesn’t enjoy talking about herself, so there’s a chance I’m wrong.  She does seem to like me a lot – the last few times we were with a large group of friends, she spoke to me the most. We share similar interests and, I think, a lot of similar tastes, morals, thoughts etc. 
 If she rejects me, I think I’ll be okay. I’d like to continue getting to know her on a platonic level, in that case. I’d just be worried about how it would affect our current friendship  (ah that age-old conundrum!),  because I wouldn’t want it to nip in the bud a friendship that has only just begun due to an air of awkwardness that might permeate our interactions following my confession. I wouldn’t want to muddy the waters between us, seeing as we’d have another year of university to navigate together whether we strike up a relationship or not. 
 Though I think what most worries me is the potential negative effect it may have on her. I’m deathly afraid of upsetting her, or causing her to freak out over this. With that in mind, my current plan is to let her know via a note or letter. 
 The next time I see her alone I’ll give her a note in an envelope when we go our separate ways. It’ll say something like this; 
 >“[Girl’s name] 
 >I felt you’d appreciate a letter over a conversation in this instance. 
 >I like spending time with you. You’re rather smashing. 
 >Would you like to go on a date? 
 >All the best,
>[My name]” 
 I’m guessing a lot of you will come back with a ‘Just ask her out in person,’ sort of approach, and while I see it’s merit, I’d prefer to give her the option of time in which to think of a response. I think she’d become flustered if I ‘cornered her in conversation,’ so to speak. 
 So I’d appreciate your thoughts on; 
 Should I let her know of my romantic interest at all?

"I worked at this gas station with this 300lb woman (I'm not exaggerating).  Not only did she never do anything, but she was OBSESSED with babies and pregnancy.  Now, as a dude in his mid-twenties, I don't give a shit about babies.  She would spend the entire shift talking my ear off about her many, many pregnancies.  The thing that was the worst, though, was when any time a slightly larger female would come into the store, she would always ask them ""when are you due?""  Well.... Sometimes they weren't ""due"" at all and were just a little chubby.  I can't tell you how many times I had to make myself go momentarily numb to the world when she'd ask that stupid question.","woman I worked with would occasionally ask larger ladies when their baby was due, only to find out that they're just kinda fat.",25,M,AskReddit
"To preface this post, I'm 15 year old from a small, affluent town in New England. Our town has roughly 10,000 and the current graduating class has 174 kids in it, so it's a pretty small place (news gets around fast.  Very Fast). I'm a member of my school's theater program and I've enjoyed it a ridiculous amount thus far (just backstage so far, but I'm auditioning next week) and I've met some of the best (and worst) kinds of people because of it. Anyway, on to the topic at hand. 
 I don't have the opportunity to go to many parties, but when I do they're always the kind where everyone gets drunk/high and crashes at the house. I drink (though have never gotten completely drunk owing to extenuating circumstances, described below) and have considered partaking in trees, but am waiting until after AP testing next year to  enjoy myself  try it. In my opinion, as long as no one is leaving, I honestly don't see any issue with a kids doing that as long as they don't put anyone else in danger (ie drunk driving). 
 My parents, however, feel a little differently.. 
 My mother grew up in the bible belt in an unbelievably conservative household. I have trouble believing that she drank anything until she was well past the legal age and if you could prove to me that she's ever done drugs, I would be very impressed. My father, the youngest of three, (probably-definitely) partied hard in college and may have done so in high school as well (he grew up in an affluent suburb in New Jersey). They have a strict policy about parties: ""Nothing good happens after midnight,"" so I'm out of the party by 12; 12:30 if I'm lucky 
 I can completely understand where they're coming from, they don't want me out breaking the law with my hoodlum friends, however this philosophy results in me getting cockblocked (lol) and it creates a disconnect between those that ""were there"" and those that ""weren't."" It's also a lot of fun that it kinda (really) sucks to miss out on.","Me: Parties=good (sans drunk driving)/Parents: Parties=bad, f*ck you. Me: okay.jpg

"I (Male 18 at the time) met this incredible woman a year ago on may 25 (Female at the time 18). Ever since that day, I have thought about her day and night. We started dating 20 days later. 
 Unfortunately, she had to go to college in New York 2 months later and we decided to give it a go. We've been doing long distance pretty much the whole year. I've been over there two times and she's been here couple of times due to spring break, winter break, ect. Everything was perfect. I never thought I could love a girl as much as her. 
 She started to distance herself from me about 3 months ago. So I decided to give her a surprise visit in New York (I've already went once for her birthday on October). She called me about a week after I booked the flights and told me that she needed some space. I had a huge panic attack. I was contemplating on telling her if a was going over there or wait and surprise her. I decided to tell her. The mini break was pretty much over. 
 When I went over there is was no doubt the most amazing time I've had in my life. I will always remember those 3 days. Afterwards everything went back to normal. Skype calls pretty much every day and texts every day. Ever since that day she almost broke up with me, I've been scared. Scared that she would have those feelings again. I was right. 
 About 1.5 - 2 months ago, I started to feel her pull away from me again, slowly. I talked to her about this, but she said that finals and her grades were putting a lot of stress on her, and I understood that, since she was going to Barnard, a subdivision of Columbia University, and the semester was coming to an end. As time passed, Skype calls started to decrease, text messages started becoming drier and drier. I again tried to talk to her about it but she insisted that it was her stress about college. Also, it was about a month away from summer, which ment we were going to be together for 4 months! A moment I've been waiting for all year. 
 I picked her up from the airport on the 15th (8 days ago) and I felt something wrong. On the drive back, she started mentioning that I have been being a bit of a pushover, and I have to agree. I've been trying my best to keep this relationship alive, sometimes not expressing myself fully to avoid a fight. But I've always had a problem with this, since my mother is super strict and I have always been afraid of making mistakes. She said that if she keeps feeling that she is over powering me, she doesn't know if we would do it. I reassured her that I will do my best to be straightforward and not hide anything to avoid a fight. I took her home and everything seemed to be fine. 
 The following day, we went to a party. She was so damn beautiful. I missed her so much. During the party, we sat and talked about what happened the previous day. I felt that I connected with her again. But then, something strange happend, she said that this summer, she needed to fall in love with me again. I paused and asked her if she was in love with me. She said yes yes yes of course, but she just needed to connect with me again. She also told me that she doesn't think she can do another year of long distance. In the past, I've planned to transfer to New York, but it's extremely hard due to its costs. In the end, it was a successful conversation. I tried not to get too emotional, but I was confident that we were starting to fix the damage long distance has done. We have a whole four months! Anyways, after the party we went to my house and had the most amazing sex. I was so happy. I held her as we cuddled and began to feel a warm feeling inside, something I haven't felt in a while due to all this disconnecting. 
 The following day we talked and she wanted to make sure everything was fine after the talk we had. Everything seemed to be going back to normal. I let all my emotions out, telling her how I've been feeling and that she was everything to me. Talking the past few days with her was incredible, but things changed very quickly. 
 Fast forward to Tuesday (4 days ago). She started being dry again. She wanted to come over to watch a movie, like we always did when she come from New York. I noticed some strange things. Instead of me picking her up like always, she wanted to come in her dad's car. Strange. This was she first thought of ""is she going to break up with me and avoid an awkward car ride home?"" But I shook it off. When she come, she wanted to go on a walk. Every more concerning. That walk was the weirdest walk we have ever had. She seemed stage, and didn't hold me hand. But nothing happend. We watched a show afterwards and she just paid attention to that. No talking. Few episodes later, she had to leave. She kissed me and started walking towards the door. I stood up. She never does this. I always take her to her car (if she brings a car or is getting picked up). I stood up and walked her to the door. We kissed for a while and she left. She didn't say I love you, like she always did. From that night, things went downhill fast. 
 The next day I wanted to talk to her but she had something with a friend. I needed to talk to her in person. Anyways, for a while now we have been planning to go to my sister's show for her birthday (May 21st, 2 days ago). I had a tennis match that day and told her that there is a possibility of not going, but I decided that I needed to talk to her and watch my sister's rehearsal (it was her birthday!) I called her that morning and told her I defaulted my match and if she wanted to go to the rehearsal. She said that she might go, cause she panned something with a friend, but she'll try to cancel. Again, conversation ending with me saying I love you and her hanging up. Couple of hours later, she texted me asking if I was home and wanted to pass by. My heart stopped. I knew exactly what was going to happend. I opened the door and she was in tears. She said that it didn't feel the same anymore and she couldn't keep on with it. I asked her if there was someone else included and she said no. I cried on the floor for a while and then she stood me up, looked at me, and said that I will find someone that appreciates me. I cried even harder and she hugged me. She said if I was ready to be friends, to text her. And left. I've been crying non stop for the past few days, eating barely nothing. It is the worst pain I have ever felt in my entire life. I just cried and cried and wanted to do nothing with my life. I haven't been able to do anything. I have this memory box things I've collected from our relationship. I can't stop looking at it. Movie tickets, plane tickets, birthday cards, cork from wine bottles. I can't stand it. Many friends have told me that she would come back and talk again, since she if going to be here another 4 whole months. The time perfect time to finally reconnect with her is now ruined. It's been hell for me these past few days. 
 All day, I've been waiting for her message. Hoping she would feel what I'm feeling and regret the break. In a few days, it's going to the day I met her last year. I remember that night we looked at the stars and tried to name them with an application I had. The only star we got was Arcturus. Since then it has been our star. On that day, I'm going to put a snapshot of the location of the star in Snapchat, I know that as soon as she sees it, she will remember the day we met. I don't know is this is a good idea. I'm sorry writing so damn much. It's a way to vent out I suppose. I need some advice on what to do to. Everyone has told me going out and being with friends and family. It works, but when I'm alone, it's a pain I can't bear.","My long distance girlfriend of almost a year broke up with me when she came back for summer, and I'm the worst pain I've ever felt in my life.",18,M,relationships
"My friend, let's call him Steven, and I have been best friends for the past 3 years now. We started off as close buddies and progressively became closer as we hung out more and more often. For about the last 6 months, I've been attending the same academy as he was. After preparing for the big test with him at the academy, I aced the test, and graduated; ultimately leaving him behind. (Note: Just if it makes it more clear, I was studying the SAT2 Math Level 2C Exam). Ever since I've left the academy, I've had less time to hang around with him. As a junior in high school, I have a lot more responsibilities than I did back as a freshman. I understand that time away from him makes it hard to be as close as we were, but I feel that I'm falling further away from him. Of course there are a lot more factors, but I'll explain that as thoroughly as possible throughout this submission. 
 First off, I'd like to clarify that even as close friends, we've had some pretty nasty fights. They weren't such a big deal actually; until this school year. I have a tendency to cut contact briefly when arguing because if I feel that the topic is pointless, there is no need to ruin the relationship. Steven is not the brightest person on the planet. Even though I'd love him till death (no homo), we have silly arguments. For example, maybe if we were talking about the Marvel Universe, we'd argue about the theories regarding the uncertainties in it. Of course the arguments were more realistic (it's just that I can't think of one off the top of my head). I would provide evidence and logic behind my arguments while he would just throw out his thoughts to me without justifying them. Now, I don't have a problem with that; I respect the opinions of others. The problem I have with Steven is that he will get emotionally attached and start yelling. If I had to describe out relationship, he's the muscle and I'm the brain. He has his leverage by raising his voice. I believe in being rational and giving everyone a chance, so when I try to argue my point, he won't let me. That's what makes me mad; just as I respect your opinion and your time to speak, I should be given the same opportunity and respect. 
 The biggest problem with these arguments were that they got out of hand. The first instance was at one of my classes. We were given the task of making a picture book where the picture was in the front and the words for it were on the back. By design, it was supposed to have many pages meaning that the description for the photos needed to be 1 step ahead of the photos so that when putting the page at the back, the correct text could be read. However, I made a mistake when building this with my friend and he got frustrated with me. He sighed, clearly annoyed, and I tired of bottling in erupted. It made a scene with some unnecessary vulgar words on both sides and an audience. Of course, he and I weren't super serious, it was just another one of our fights for us, but the crowd mistook it. I got a lot of backlash for being emotional and overreacting. I tend to have a loud voice, so I can see how easily it could be for me to look like the bad guy. But to be brutally honest, I have a gut feeling that Steven changed the story when asked; but I can excuse that since he probably just wanted to save face. 
 Now the issue I have with this is that people saw me as someone who overreacted quickly. It can be more accurately described by the Korean word ""삐졌어."" I have no clue as to how I can translate this word accurately into English as I am unfamiliar with the direct translation. Basically it means that I'm ""being a baby,"" for the lack of better words. Now this word is also used when I refuse to talk to the person I'm arguing with to prevent further collateral damage. However, now even that is viewed as being like a kid in the eyes of my peers. 
 The next big factor that I see is when I helped Steven get a girlfriend. Steven told me about this girl he really liked so naturally, I did my research. Turns out the girl he likes, let's call her Sally, likes him too! Just like all good friends do, her best friend immediately started talking to me, and we began to formulate a ship (if you catch my drift). So everything was going nicely and it seemed that the day Steven was going to ask Sally out was the day of my birthday. What better birthday present than seeing your best friend find a girl! But the day before the big day was going to happen, Sally figured out that her friend and I had been talking behind their back about this. Sally was cool about this, but thought it would be good to mention this to Steven. Steven suddenly blew up at me on Facebook and began to furious about why I was talking to her best friend behind his back. He said he knew but really just didn't want to say anything. At that point, I had no idea what was going on and was quite confused. It turned out that Sally had seen her friend's phone when her friend had left it out by accident. Somehow, Steven connected that Sally didn't want to be in a relationship because of the talking I had done with her friend. I figured this out later, but Sally wasn't ready to be in a relationship. She told this to me personally and asked me to kindly tell Steven. What I've concluded is that Sally told Steven about her friend talking to me AND how she didn't want to be in a relationship. This must've made Steven think that it was because of the talking. As a result, Steven blamed me for not being able to get with Sally. He cooled down eventually, but he was very rude to me that day. And as a good friend, I took it since I understood that he couldn't be thinking straight. Deep down I was hoping that Steven would apologize sooner or later but it never happened. 
 Now that school has started again after winter break, I've felt more distant and depressed. I've felt negative recently and wished I could have more friends. The fun, friends have together seemed to be more apparent.

"Vodka. 
 It was my roommate's 20th birthday, let's call her Ashley, and after our original plans were a bust (a highlighter party was busted by the police) she decided to bring us (one other friend, let's call her Hannah, and me) to a friend's house full of people I didn't know. Que Ashley getting all of the best alcohol in the house and immediately being trashed while Hannah and I stood around awkwardly while these new people refused us alcohol. So we pooled about $10 and begged a random guy to buy us a handle of Barton. Yes, that Barton. The scum of all vodkas that only minors contemplate consuming. So Hannah and I take a couple of shots and resume standing around awkwardly. 
 After approximately 5 minutes of watching an uninteresting game of beer pong I decide I'm not nearly close enough to the level of drunk I considered acceptable at bad parties. I head back up to the kitchen where Hannah and I take another 5 shots. We figure this will hold us up. To be honest we were probably already fairly drunk by the 3rd, but due to the the lack of time between shots we had no time to realize this. Que an older girl walking into the kitchen who introduces herself to us as Rihanna. This time I refuse to change her name because, I mean, really. The immediate hate I had of her and her half-sized excuse for a shirt in combination with her name lives with me to this day. She found our choice in alcohol ""cute"" and dared Hannah and I to take double shots. Hannah backed out as she was about 5"" shorter than I and probably 15lbs smaller, already on her way to trashed. For those of you not keeping track, Hannah and I were at 7 shots each in a time span of 15 minutes. But I was young, foolish, already drunk without realizing it yet, and I wanted to show Rihanna I wasn't the uptight minor despite my white polo and khakis I hadn't bothered to change out of from work. So of course I took a double shot. 
 I remember Rihanna smirking and my urge to slap it off of her, but here is where my memory gets a little hazy. The guy who bought Hannah and I the alcohol walked into the kitchen, and I proudly tout that I and all 125lbs of me, had just taken 7 shots in a row. He said something along the lines of not believing me, so I decide in all my infinite wisdom that I will take another double shot to ""prove it."" (Shot count = 11. Time frame = 15 minutes. Alcohol tolerance at the time = low.) The last thing I remember was turning around to tell him ""told ya so."" 
 I woke up the next morning at around 11am without a clue where I was. I was in the middle of the hallway, a pillow under my head with a wet spot underneath, with a blanket half covering me. My white polo was around my neck, I was wearing someone else's over-sized shirt and my hair was sloppily thrown into a scrunchy. Various unconscious strangers were scattered around the living room. I couldn't find Hannah but I managed to find my roommate who drove us back to the dorms. I spent the rest of the day with an epic hangover so great I refused to leave my bunk bed because I couldn't figure out how my body worked long enough to get up there in the first place. 
 The next day I questioned Ashley about the events that occurred during my black out. She explained to me that I had about 10 minutes of ""fun"" in which I was just a happy sloppy drunk. After this I proceeded to projectile vomit on the girl who owned the house. Three times. Why I was following her around long enough to do so is unknown to anyone. Ashley had decided I needed to get home before I caused any more destruction and called some guy to pick me up. When he arrived I was still able to walk with the help of three others. They shoved me into the guy's Jeep but chose that moment to vomit all over his back seat. He immediately freaked out and refused to drive me home. I can't blame the guy, I wouldn't have driven my sorry excuse anywhere. Ashley managed to remove me from the guy's Jeep but I forced myself to the ground and refused to get up from the middle of the street. Meanwhile my would-be-savior-in-a-Jeep takes off, leaving Ashley to get one of the guys from the house to carry me inside, fireman style. According to him I fought pretty violently. Once inside he threw me on the living room couch. Ashley and the girl who I had vomited on were worried about my white polo. How I had managed to not blow chunks all over myself by this point is miraculous. Or skillful. So they attempt to remove my shirt but were unsuccessful due to my flailing. I can't imagine I was too happy about having my clothing removed in the living room full of strangers. They left my shirt around my neck and managed to throw another one on me. 
 My story then is unknown for the rest of the night as Ashley then went outside for her birthday gift - some allegedly great weed they smoked in the backyard. So I have approximately 2 hours of time in which no one I can find to this date know what I was up to. I have met people and have them suddenly state ""oh, you were that girl on the couch..."" so perhaps I was merely passed out. Also, great way to be remembered let me tell you. I was found in the hallway with vomit under me at about 7 in the morning by one of the guys that lived in the house. He was headed to work and figured I had tried to go to the bathroom (I was just outside the door) but didn't make it far enough. He felt bad for me so gave me a pillow and covered me up.

"I was friends with this guy for 2 years in highschool, best friends we hung out every day we'd go for long walks and we would talk about our relationships with other people. Then one day things changed, we slowly started becoming closer and closer a little kiss here a little kiss there and suddenly we found ourselves dating. At the time I liked the idea of being in love with my high school sweet heart. It was also nice to date your best friend. 
 Fast forward 3 years, we got engaged and I thought I was the happiest and luckiest person ever. But this was a month before we were starting university. Our original plan was to go to the same school so we could get a car together and drive everyday. But a complication with the acceptances happened and he ended up having to go away to another school in a city a little while away from me. So now I was stuck in a different school all by myself. I'm terrible at making friends so it was really hard for me to adjust and I didn't really like university all that much. He made it better for me, but we mostly only talked through skype. 
 Changing from a relationship where he lives next door to a long distance relationship was so difficult, he was good at making friends so he was always either busy with that or with his school work. Which I understand it's a new experience for him too. University was weird for me, people quickly found out I was engaged and boys started avoiding me for that. Girls always treated me differently. They all go out in skimpy outfits and have hook ups and I’m just jealous of it all. Because there’s me being nice and talking with guys that come up to me at bars and then having to turn them down because I'm engaged. I mean I'm 20 years old I feel like I deserve to be able to party and have hook ups and enjoy getting drunk and things that you do in university. But here I'm stuck just making sure that I don’t do anything to upset my fiancé. 
 I mean it's good when we're together, don't get me wrong. When we're together it feels nice, but lately I just don't know what to do. I like being friends with him, but I just feel like our relationship went a little too fast. And our lives are so intertwined, I work at a factory with his mom and dad and a couple uncles, we have a pets together, we have many collections together, so even if I tried to break it off I don't think I would be able to live with myself. But I just want to be able to go out and have fun from time to time. I want to use tinder and have some crazy one night stands or something? I just want to live like a normal 20 year old. 
 I actually tried to break up with him recently, but it just didn’t work. He didn’t take me seriously at first, and then kept saying he can change and be better for me but I’m just not sure if I want that? 
 My supervisor (24) at work has been showing interest in me. I know he doesn't know I'm engaged (because I can't wear my ring at work and he doesn't know any of my fiancé’s family) and it's just making me feel so special. I love feeling like something wants me or lusts for me. With my fiancé it just seems like the same old same old there's not much excitement. I flirt back with my supervisor occasionally, and in my head I want him to ask me out for a beer or for a coffee or something and I know that I would say yes but I know that I would find it really hard to tell him that I’m in a relationship, much less engaged. 
 I just feel like I’m stuck and I don’t know what to do about it. I don’t know what to think.

"My boyfriend [18M] and I [19F] have been together for 2ish years. We are best friends, love each other so much, and do almost everything together. When we first started dating we never ever fought, were always happy to be around each other and always wanted to be around each other. We were lucky enough to get accepted into the same university, but at different semesters, so we had to do 6 months of long distance. The long distance was really hard, we had our fair share of fights and break up scares, but we made it through and now I am with him at school. I got stuck with a dorm building that is on the complete opposite side of campus from him and ALL of my classes, and a room with insane roommates. I started sleeping over his place from day 1, and now it sort of evolved to living with him (it's so much easier, and since he refuses to let me walk home at night alone I end up sleeping there every night). 
 But since I've gotten here my boyfriend has been struggling with the idea of being single and it really freaks me out. It's not that we're awful together and secretly hate each other, because it's the opposite, we are soooo good together and best friends. He explains it to me that he just thinks about whether his life would be easier without having to 'take care of someone else' or 'deal with any of this'. 
 I understand these concerns on some level, like if he truly had to 'take care' of another human at his age and place in life where he really has no worries, that would suck! But I am fully functional human being who he doesn't have to do shit for...Part of me wants to be like 'well fuck you then' and break it off, if being with me is 'dealing with it' then go fucking not deal with it, but part of me understands and wants to wait it out and believe that he kinda likes being with me. 
 I just feel really confused because I understand the desire to be single in college and the freedom that college provides to not really deal with anything you don't haaaave to deal with. But I also understand that my boyfriend and I are great together, could last forever if we let it, and I don't know what to say or do or think or feel.

"Paintball was around before the wife. I started playing in '97 and I met her in '98. We dated in high school and she knew the priorities were 1) Paintball 2) Her 3) Work 4) School, respectively.

I'm finally starting to do my work thoroughly and completely and turning it in, and as a result performing better overall in classes.  However, this has meant that I have to spend about 12-14 hours/day on campus with all my classes and homework, and when I go home I sit and stress about the work I didn't get done that day.

 Should I abandon engineering and switch to something that would be more fun in college, or does this misery that they call ""engineering school"" actually pay off in the long-run?  Honestly, I'm medically depressed at school and feel my personality disappearing as I spend more hours in the library and fewer hours out in the real world.","Miserable in engineering school, is this bullshit actually worth it in the long run?",20,M,engineering
"This may end up long winded, and just to preface I have been to therapists, and I have been ""validated"" by them, but it's just not clicking for whatever reason. I also am a bit descriptive about a few things between my father and I. 
 Here is my struggle. My father was overbearing, he was not present for the years of 8-15/16, and when he got back to ""being a dad"" he was not okay with me being a teen. He would force me to kiss him on the lips when I didn't want to. One time I remember him yelling at me for 30 minutes about how God had placed me in his care, and because I was in his care I was to do as he said, it was the basis for everything. He never crossed lines below the belt, but he crossed boundaries other then that all the time. He often told me how much I looked like my mom, and for a short time my mom was very jealous of me and we had a hard time. Later she realized that my dad liking his children was not our fault. 
 When I was 18 I was raped, I didn't tell my family, I just started seeing a therapist on my own. I got an STD. A few months later my mom found out, I had been depressed, she asked the right questions I broke down yadda yadda. When I was 19 my mom said I needed to tell my dad, so I did. When I came home from college he locked me in a room sat me down and made me tell him EVERY detail, when I didn't want to he yelled at me and said he wasn't the enemy, he forced me into a chair, and put his arms around me and kissed my neck. Once I was free I got in my car and drove away. When I got home he made me apologize (again specifying that he was my father and God says I need to be respectful). 
 I was raped again, it left me with a different STD. This time I told my mom, she told my dad. He is forever bringing up how I am such a whore. 
 I am now 27, I have an amazing husband, and 3 beautiful daughters. Last year while my mom was visiting she told my husband and I that my father had gotten drunk and confessed his infatuation with his children, and how difficult it was to have ""hot daughters"". In this particular instance he made specific comments about my sister, as she has kept her beauty while I have not. 
 A few weeks later my dad visited, he kissed me on the neck again, he hit my daughter across the face (she wasn't yet 3 at the time), he said he needed to pray for me, so he wrapped me in his arms and prayed with his lips against my shoulder. 
 My dad asked to visit a few months ago, and I said no. I told him why, I sent it in an e-mail. My mom asked me to keep out what he said to her while drunk because it was only hearsay, and he was talking mostly about my sister and not me because I'm not beautiful anymore. My mom in some ways agrees with me, but she thinks I'm being to hard on my dad. My aunt (one of dad's sisters) was actually molested by my grandfather and she let her kids see him as long as she was present. I don't care what my aunt did or if everyone forgave grandpa, I don't think just because that's what my aunt did that's what I have to do too. 
 I'm talking to a therapist, he agrees that I shouldn't let my dad into our lives. My husband doesn't want him near me or the girls, and if for some reason we are in the same area (maternal grandparents, who I miss greatly, are having a family reunion this summer if we come up with the money) he wants to always be present. My family thinks I'm being to hard, my MIL told me off about how I was a liar and my dad is upset and hurting all because I am keeping my kids from him and I need to understand how he feels. Dad's sister has gone off on how awful I am. Basically the general feeling is that I'm an asshole and ""poor dad"". My mom agrees with me, but they are also still married and she sometimes buys in to the whole ""You are going to burn in hell for being such an awful wife and turning my children against me"" My grandma and grandpa (maternal) sides with me and my husband, grandma has said she wants everyone to get along grandpa says ""He's an asshole treat him as such""  I think my dad's a a self righteous jackass, who used religion to get his way, and even though I've confronted him he still feels like he's done nothing wrong. 
 Maybe I just needed to get it off my chest, but how can I come to terms with my family not agreeing with my decision even though I believe NOT having my father in our lives is what is best for everyone? And what's more, how can I shake that ""You are awful for not doing as your father says"" feeling that was so ingrained into me? I know it's not right but I'm so used to it that I can't seem to just get rid of it.","Dad is an ass, don't want him around, how do I deal?",27,F,rapecounseling
"Here goes:
Some background: I am a nerd, I've built up my career since I was 16 going from IT consulting to management consulting; this strange path has netted me tremendous opportunities at a very young age, and by 24 I had lived and worked on 4 separate continents after dropping out of high school to start my IT consulting business (I lost, essentially, my entire family from 12-16; this started out of necessity). 
 I only just recently decided to finally pursue an undergraduate degree as a means to essentially let me work on a tech startup and a few other entrepreneurial endeavors rather than paid project consulting.  I work a lot, and it's been a 3 year economic sacrifice but the projects I am putting together are finally starting to pan out and are in a field I am passionate about.  Basically, life could not be better (though by no means am I earning an income like I used to), except it is empty. 
 //End of useless background 
 Its hard for me to relate to people due to my life experiences and nerdiness (aspiness?); it's especially hard to relate to women my own age.  I typically dated older women (80% were 2-10+ years older) due to being able to relate to them better, and possibly some expectation of the relationship not going anywhere serious. 
 I work about 80-100 hours a week between my startup, taking 5 classes, a major project I am running, and some side-job consulting gigs that pay for tuition/rent. 
 In spite of all this, I have, through no fault of my own, had the opportunity to date some truly exceptional young women in the last 4 years since returning to the U.S.  I go for extremely intelligent women who are passionate and driven like I am (first mistake).  Typically they are nerds who looked/acted awkward in High School but really blossomed into adulthood, but still haven't caught up socially (second mistake) which I find cute. 
 I know what I want, am attracted to, and the last 3-4 women I've dated have been getting, seemingly, progressively better suited for me.  I even fell in love for the first time this last year, but that ended poorly.  In fact, every relationship I've pursued with an age-appropriate woman has failed within 3-6 months.  It is incredibly disheartening. 
 My close female friends who have known me for years cannot fathom how/why this keeps happening (I am apparently ""quite the catch""), but inevitably it seems every woman I date just sort of freaks out and just ""can't handle this right now"" or  isn't ""in the same emotional or mental state"" as I am right now. 
 I can't really understand what is going on.  I know that I want to be married in the next 3-5 years, and the women are the ones who push the relationship from casual dating into serious/committed relationship territory.  Every time they do this, however, within 1-3 weeks we break up.  Every. Single. Time. 
 Are these relationships moving too quickly (even if I'm not the one pushing them?)?  Do nerdy/socially awkward/highly intelligent women work by a different set of rules?  Is my availability of only seeing a girl 1-2 times a week (but for 4-10 hours at a time) not enabling a proper foundation to be built?  What is the dating etiquette, for pursuing highly intelligent, driven, passionate women?","Smart, successful guy dates highly intelligent women, they make the relationship ""serious"" then freak out and we break up.",24,M,relationship_advice
"Mine was in the 4th grade on my birthday. I was short, wore glasses and was obsessed with Pokemon. I used to get picked on in school by a guy called Joey. This was back when Pokemon first came to the states and blew up. I was obsessed and would constantly carry at least 3 folders worth of cards in my backpack. I remember I refused to walk out of the house if I didn't have a Pokeball attached to my belt. Trading pokemon cards was fun until kids like Joey would just take your cards and then beat you up if you tried to get them back. As the kid who was decked out in Poke-everything, it pretty much made me an obvious target. He comes to me in class and says ""give me that booster pack you got for your birthday or I'll beat you"" I told him no, but then it happened at recess 
 Im walking around during recess when Joey comes from behind me and sucker punches me. I hit the ground hard and can see him stooping to pick up my backpack. I grab a tree branch that happened to be close to me and proceed to hit him with it. after a couple swats, he lets go of my bag and i book it for the jungle gym. Joey huffs after me, his face red with frustration. I reach the jungle gym first and right as Joey reaches the top where I am, I did the only thing i could think of; I SPARTAN KICKED THE SHIT OUT OF THIS KID. he hits the ground and starts to cry. three things happened that day. Joey got a hairline fracture, the school deemed what happened to him an accident because the jungle gym was old and rickety and nobody saw me kick him off and the best part was that because he had to go to the hospital for his injury, he didn't get to eat any of the ice cream cake I brought my class for my birthday.","Don't take my pokemon cards, or I'll do to you what Charlie Murphy did to Rick James",10,M,AskReddit
"I was on the fence on which DE to get next and sought the [opinions]( of the community.  After reading the responses i was still a bit unsure and was trying to decide between the slant and a Weber and thinking I would probably get both. 
 To provide some context:  I'm in my early 40's and have been shaving with a DE since I started shaving.  Up until a few weeks ago it was a Gillette Slim Twist and Barbasol or gillette foam.  Since I stumbled on this subreddit (and largely due to going mental from quitting smoking after 22+ years) I've gained various A.D.'s and now have 2 brushes, 4 razors, a sampler pack of 9 types of blades, 2 shaving creams, shaving soap, 2 aftershave balms, witch hazel, alum, styptic pencil, menthol crystals, essential oils, bottle of glycerine and a scuttle on its way.  Most everyone I know thinks I'm nuts :) 
 Anyway - I have probably shaved with the slim twist around 1000 times .  I know that sucker.  I'm not sure I could cut myself using that razor and I've gone times where I've used a blade 10 to 15 times because I was able to apply more pressure to compensate.  So my technique has gone to hell.  I can fly through a shave. 
 With some trepidation I chose a blade (Astra for the first time) and whipped up some lather (from a shave soap - tabac - for the first time ever - had to cheat with a little cream) and started shaving with a slant for the first time. 
 First stroke - long stroke starting from my sideburns - WTF - absolutely no tactile feedback - no sound.  I literally looked at the razor head to make sure I had loaded a blade. 
 Continued shaving while playing with the angle.  The only time I could really hear or feel any feedback was ATG. 
 Took a look in the mirror after the first pass and was extremely disappointed.  Didn't look like much reduction at all. 
 Continued playing with the angles and forcing myself to  not  apply pressure.  Finished my 3 passes and apply my witch hazel/glycerine/lavendar oil concoction and as I'm rubbing my face I realize my face is pretty damn smooth - pretty much BBS.  Why that is surprising though is that it doesn't  look  smooth - I can see more follicles then I normally do. 
 I have quite a bit of irritation/razor bumps on the jaw and neck but that is all on me and technique (not maintaining the angle and putting in too much pressure). 
 I'm looking forward to getting some discipline back in my technique and I want to see the results then.  But damn ... the lack of feedback from the razor is disconcerting.","changed up pretty much everything and used a slant for the first time.

"Haha! Well, that didn't QUITE happen to me, but I have a story which starts out similarly. 
 A friend from college and I share a birthday. We have a lot of mutual friends, so he decided to host a birthday party for the both of us at his place. I should add that similar to your story, my friend is gay, and at midnight, I would be 21. Side note: I also live in Chicago. 
 So the party kicks off around 8, people come and go as the night rolls on, and about 11:30, we start planning what to do at/after midnight. Finally coming back out of party mode, I take a glance around the room and notice, yep, definitely the only straight male left. And it's only males left; I guess I'd said goodbye to more people than I thought. So the guys are talking and the plan is to go to Charlie's (a bar) at midnight and start the night off right. Oh boy! My first bar as a legal adult! Then I do the math: Midnight, group of gay men and me, and in a progressive neighborhood. I text my buddy, ""Hey, just out of curiosity, are we going to a gay bar?"" 
 He looks up, smiles, and nods profusely. 
 We head down to the bar, and the guys say that they'll make sure I don't get into trouble or roofied. They laugh. I don't. Nothing happened to me of course, they were cool guys. The 'mission', evidently, was for them to play bodyguard to make sure nothing like that did happen. Though they mentioned that there was a man there who was notorious for turning straight men, gay. Total bullshit if you ask me, but after them making the roofie joke... it just wasn't the best timing. Drinks kept flowing, I had a great time, and I was able to meet a straight woman and get her number. That night was Country Night as well, so before I know it, I'm on the floor line dancing to Boot Scoot Boogie at 2 in the morning in a gay bar. Not gonna lie, having an entourage of gay dudes watching my ass (no pun intended) while at a bar was crazy; my buddy has an awesome choice in his friends. Took a cab home a few hours later, and that's how I spent my 21st.",Was also the only straight man in a group of only men. My 21st birthday was spent drinking and country line dancing in a gay bar.

"Okay, so usually I'm chill with keeping my stuff to myself and dealing with it, but I can't sleep (GMT - it's 2.20am right now) and this is what my mind keeps drifting back to, so I'd like some opinions. Obviously I'll make my own choices and stuff, it's just interesting to hear what other people say, and I'd also like some advice on how to go about it. 
 Before we start, I'm 16, female and at boarding school so  any  relationship is going to end up semi-long distance for at least some of the time, but I'm okay with that and I'm pretty good at making that work. Here's the choice of lovely bachelors: 
 Bachelor Numero Uno  is a guy I met through my stepsister about two years ago - the first night we met was her 18th and he wasn't feeling too well from travel-sickness and then drinking, so I kind of looked after him for the evening and made sure he was okay. As such we ended up talking a lot and discovered that we like a lot of the same music (I like slightly more acoustic artists where he likes more rock, but there's a huge overlap in the middle), and he plays piano like a  god . Not even joking. 
 Anyways, since then we've been pretty good friends, we've been to the cinema together a few times and hung out and stuff a lot, and last year we were lying on my living room floor watching Happy Feet whilst playfighting when he almost made a move. I freaked out and backed off completely because I was going out with a guy which it was never going to work out with, but I still didn't want to cheat, but I don't think Numero Uno knew I was in a relationship. After that we stopped talking as much because I had exams and he was starting uni and blahblahblah, but recently we've started talking again and I do rather like him. I find him fairly attractive and we have a lot in common, but I'm not sure whether I should try to regain things after me rejecting him. 
 Bachelor Numero Dos  is a guy I met around the same time as Numero Uno, but didn't talk to that much at the time. We met at drama camp and as such have a fair bit in common (namely a love of theatre-things, music and slight eccentricities), and aside from that we have a lot more in common. We only started talking recently (in the past few months) and few get along like a house on fire when we're talking, but I'm always afraid that I'm being too pushy with talking. With people I get along well with, I tend to just say hi when they're online on facebook and start a full-blown conversation, but I know a lot of people aren't used to or don't like that, so I'm trying to tone it down a bit. 
 Whilst there hasn't been any flirting, there have been a few hints that he wants to talk more (namely me joking that I was going to have to bug him every time he's online because he said he had to go but he wanted to talk another time, and him replying with ""please do!""). He's got big exams coming up soon, so I guess he's probably a bit busy with that, and I do believe that both of us are going to drama camp again this summer so I may just wait it out and see how things go there, but I really like him and when we talk, the conversations last for hours. 
 Both bachelors live a fair bit away from my home so it's not as simple as ""hang out with both of them and see who makes a move first"", and both of them seem fairly shy around girls - I've never seen them flirting and I'm not even sure that either of them have had girlfriends (although I know for certain they're both interested in girls that way). Numero Uno, I know I could probably have a chance with whereas I haven't spoken enough to Numero Dos (I might not be his type?), but I think me and Numero Dos probably have a little bit more in common? I don't know. 
 Take your votes! Also, advice on how to kind of coerce either of them into a flirtatious mood might help, even when Numero Uno was interested in me, he didn't flirt.","Pick a number between one and two. Tell me what it is. Tell me how to get a guy to flirt with me if he likes me. GO GO GO.

"Hello r/ketogains. I'm a 17 year old, 5'8"" male who weighs 137 pounds and has a body fat of about 15-20%. I lost 15 pounds from November to January doing the SKD alone, and I was quite pleased. I started running track in February though, and my performance was horrendous. I thought it would be fair to assume that I'd be fully adapted after 3 months, but apparently not. I was ridiculously lethargic, and my attempts to remedy this (consuming coconut oil, eating more, upping protein) were entirely unsuccessful. I waited it out for 3 weeks, and my performance remained truly terrible (i.e. 10+ minute miles!). I reluctantly began eating carbs again, and my running improved instantly (if only I could say the same thing about my body fat levels...). The lesson I took away from that episode is that I can't run seriously and do the SKD, but, searching r/ketogains, it doesn't look like anyone else has had this problem. With cross-country looming, I've reverted back to carb-eating, but seeing my waist balloon slowly before my eyes is beyond frustrating.

 I am just starting with exercising, but have been eating healthier homemade meals for a couple weeks. Then I started adding exercise; not much, just building the habit right now and trying to push for more than I did the day before. I also used to drink a lot of beer, and I replaced beer with water last week. Now I drink a gallon+ of water a day. I walk 5,000-10,000 steps a day, usually closer to the 10k mark. 
Two weeks ago I started measuring and checking my weight. I have a couple NSV: I have lost an inch in my chest, stomach and hips, my jean that once fit tightly were falling off while I walked yesterday. But I have gained 4lbs in the last couple weeks. I am not exercising enough to build any muscle yet, and I haven't really been exercising long enough for muscle gain any way. My diet is 3 eggs and 2 slices of bacon for breakfast, fruit for a snack, lunch is commonly homemade Mexican food, then fruit, then a dinner of a small portion of lean meat and vegetables. All with water between when I hit one of those ""I am bored and need a piece of chocolate"" moments.

"Well I don't really know where to begin so I guess I'll start at Dutch Bros. Some of you may know that Dutch Bros is a national coffee house, well more like a stand. Think like a One Hour photo converted into to make espressos and dankilicous breves and other caffienated treats. Now this particular coffee chain has a tendency to hire college kids mostly hot college girls. I visit this particular location almost everyday, not for the eye candy but for the much needed caffination. 
 I'm there a lot. To the point where I start to know the workers on a first name basis, the staff know my order and have it ready with a friendly ""see you cashnobucks!"" Cheers type shit. Really special. One day I visit and I notice an absolute goddess, she was cute, funny, sarcastic, nerdy, angelic blue eyes, and a incredible body. Just amazing. First time I meet her I am over whelmed with warming sensations had I forgotten about, pure enamoration, unfamilair tickely butterflies swarmed the hollow pit formally requitted for my heart. All I could stammer was my order and I left as quickly as my feet would allow. After a few more palpation like encounters I learned her name, and a few more things about her. 
 Keep in mind I'm too chicken shit to ask her out so I just keep going to her work and ordering coffee just to see her. I must have spent about $60-80 at 5 bux a cup just to try and ask her out. Each time didn't feel right, or one of her coworkers would be there in the moment. All in all I never asked her out. Fuck up number one all while keeping up my routine of spending money for 45 secs of interaction. 
 I notice one day she isn't there, no biggie I'll see her tomorrow I tell myself. Again next day, not there. This goes on for a week or two. This is where fuck up number two hits. Let me preface this by saying I have never and will never do this again. I creepily used her first name and work location to find her on Facebook, yea it gets worse. I then decide to stalk her profile further, yea it gets worse, I think she's cool so I shoot her a friend request. I get no response. Nothing. Not even a who are you. Yea it gets worse. I convice myself she knows me from the 1000's of other faces she see's daily, and she probably wants to hear from me but she is shy so I should send the first message. Yea it gets worse. I send an innocent little Hey greeting. Again completely ignored. Not blaming her but just to emphasize, no signs of invitation what so ever. A few hours goes by and I still haven't gotten a new friend or a response. 
 Then my confidence cracks like a frabrege egg, all the hindsight poured in like a fucking tsunami of negative introspection, all my creepy stalkering displayed before me. Each interaction with her replayed like a horror movie, similar to the classic grey scale re-enactments you would see on those awful murder investigation shows, complete with over dramatization. I anxiously decided I better just come clean and confess my intentions, I figured I walked up to the cliff so fuck it. I then sent another message explaining how I feel, and then another apologizing for my creepy stalking. Still no response and it's been 8 hours. I probably don't deserve any thing close to her or anyone else for that matter. So yea that's my fuckup. I'm not old, I'm 27. I'm not ugly. I'm not obese or have any health issues.

"My ex [27F] and I [28M] broke up 6 months ago when she moved away after nearly a year long off and on relationship. We finally went no contact about 1 month ago, which is why this has lingered in my mind for so long. That and that we both really really love each other. 
 The first 10 dates or so were like those out of a storybook. Date 3 she and I couldn't stop making out at my apartment, and she had to go home to get her stuff for work the next day, but I came with her because both of us wanted to make sure that we weren't dreaming this amazingness. I fell in love that night. Date 5 I took her to a very expensive restaurant (wanted to impress her) and she stuck her credit card in the bill before I could get to it. She paid for the whole meal! Date 6 we went out and then came home and played strip Mario Kart - her idea. Before a month was up, I'd told her I loved her (and I don't ever say it before 4-5 months in). A few days later she said it back. 
 Over the next months, we saw huge ups and downs. We traveled together about 10-15 times. We also broke up a few times and fought alot. I always tried to be a good boyfriend and think for the most part, I really was. She, on the other hand, was very up and down (but not hot and cold). She had a drinking problem, and would do alot of things to mess up our relationship (but would never cheat) by just starting stupid fights. She'd treat me poorly, but then in making up for it she would do some amazingly loving things. There's no doubt that we were in love but in my mind, she couldn't really handle it. Perhaps I was too eager to be in it and couldn't either. 
 She has a lot of issues. She'd never had a relationship for longer than 7 months before me. She has ADHD, acts somewhat bipolar, has issues with bulimia and body issues, and takes anti-anxiety medication. Her nicknames included ""hurricane"" and ""crazy"". She'd say things like we had more love than most married couples, that I was the love of her life, and then she'd say that I wasn't perfect for her - mostly because I didn't believe in god (something that she really didn't have much involvement in with her life). She grew up in about 5 or 6 different places and has a penchant to be a wanderlust. So she planned two 45 day trips around the world, back to back, and then indicated strongly that she wanted to leave our city. Before the first trip, she said we shouldn't be together, so we broke it off. We got back together after the 1st trip, and then said she wanted to be with me when she took the 2nd trip, but I said no if we couldn't if she couldn't tell me she'd come back and live in my city. She moved to a different continent 3 months later. 
 I've had 6 months of being single, fucking around and dating, as well as seeing her a few times. Each time, we basically act like no time has past (back to best friends with incredible sexual chemistry and love), and I still love her. And she still loves me. I'm doing everything I can to move on, but I can't help wondering if she'll come back to me. I also can't help thinking that I've never felt love like this before (hard to argue with falling completely in love after a month) and I simply can't stop thinking about her – basically every undistracted moment of my waking life, and lots of dreams as well. I'm doing everything I can to better myself, and not sure what I'm asking for other than an assessment of what I should be doing, and what i should be thinking. I guess moving on. Nothing else to say. I just feel like crap.",Relationship of incredible mutual love and attraction didn't work and we're not together. I'm wondering how this is the case with the incredible passion both of us feel towards each other. I’m having trouble getting over it even after going no contact,28,M,relationships
"3 years ago when I was 21, I was with the first and only romantic relationship. We had this trip on LSD in the middle of Topanga Canyon where we fell in love. The intensity of that experience set the tone of our relationship. In the midst of it I met girls I wanted to sleep with, she met a guy/girls she wanted to sleep with, and this caused a lot of tension because a part of us wanted to explore and while another didn't. We broke up, primarily because of my jealousy and her fear, though there were other factors at play. It crushed me and I haven't dated since. 
 Not that this is a bad thing. I got a lot accomplished in other areas of life that are important to me. But I repressed myself. I had meaningless sex once just to break the dry spill and I will never do something with that intention again. However, recently I have made a point to start dating and there is just this part of me that has to let go of caring if my partner sleeps with another person. 
 When I am happy just because she is only with me, there is something that doesn't feel right. It's the insecurity. It's not like they make me happy anyway. A partner's happiness can only bring up happiness in me. It's my happiness, they don't give it to me. This has been a revelation for me, not because I didn't intellectually get this before, but because now I feel it. Sure I'll have to work out those old traditional values that are mucking around the depths of my psyche, but I can't help but let go of them. 
 I'm pretty indifferent as of now to wether I am in an open or closed relationship (which could change if I get with a partner who isn't open to polyamory), but it just feels sexually, and relationally liberating to have opened to this idea of polyamorous relationships. Not to mention it plays into this whole integral things I have been getting into (e.g. Ken Wilber; Integral Spirituality, Integral Psychology, Integral Politics, ect...). Integral Sexuality possibly? Anyways, rant over. I just wanted to share my insight.",I just opened up to the idea of polyamorous relationships and it resonates.,21,M,polyamory
"I (26F) dated my best male friend (best friends for 5 years) (26/M) for about four months before breaking up with him. We are very compatible in many ways and ALL of our friends believe we are perfect for each other, and I do trust their opinions (although it is not the be all end all, just can't ignore that many good people :]) Needless to say people were excited we got together. But we did not last long 
 I have recently been diagnosed with PTSD, from two sexual assaults. Sex for me has been progressively more stressful and difficult with each new partner, including my the partner I had prior to this one, who I did not enjoy having sex with at all after a while, but we continued dating for 3 years. 
 The traumas are old, but the diagnosis is new (old diagnoses were depression, GAD, Panic...). I only got the PTSD diagnosis a couple of months ago while I was dating this partner I speak of. I DO enjoy sex with him, although it takes me some major warming up to get into this. 
 He was very understanding, but when push came to shove and he wanted sex, I still didn't feel like I could say no. And the couple of times I did say no, he either pushed a bit or sooked because he didn't get what he wanted. This reinforces a lack of trust with me, and he felt bad about this. But because of these behaviours I decided to be single and not have to be responsible for anyone's sexual happiness. I still love him, and he still loves me very very much. 
 We've decided to keep a physical relationship, because a) sex with him is awesome b) we want to keep SOME sort of relationship, and c) during therapy it's not great for me to keep avoiding sex... prolongs PTSD. This way I can have sex with someone I trust. It seems weird because sex is the point of contention, but I feel safer saying no over text, and don't feel as ""indebted"" to him because I'm not his girlfriend. 
 Now we're at a weird spot, where we wonder if we should just date and have him support me as best he can through my treatment and tackling of the past pain OR if I should totally cut off and deal with all of this myself. With the first option there is risk of having him ""sook"" when I say no, or him not getting sex as much as he would like (he self admittedly has a high sex drive... of course). And if I completely cut him off I could lose him for good... although I believe if it is meant to be it would come around when the time is right. Still scary though. 
 Can anyone relate, or have similar experiences with rape/triggers/relationship difficulties? And what do you think is best: break it off completely, continue this ""semi-relationship"", or just date and continue to work on it as a team with the risk of being triggered?","I have PTSD from previous sexual assaults (with other men), and felt the need to break up with my partner because of our different sexual drives.

"So this is actually my first post on reddit under this account and all in all honesty I'm not sure if this is the correct subreddit to be posting under. 
 Anyway so here is the situation. 
 I'm a 21 y/o female who is finishing up studying a pretty intensive undergraduate major of bioengineering. I take about 20 credits worth of classes a semester and I work 20 hours a week on top of it at a lab.  I started a relationship with a very sweet mechanical engineer, let's call him ""A"" (21/m) during my freshman year and we continued dating until recently (our senior year). Our entire relationship was pretty innocent and sweet. He's very closed about his emotions and being nerdy engineers we were the first real partner either of us has ever had. We did everything together once we connected, and because of the overlap in classes our lives got more and more intertwined. (Think living together in a ""right down the hallway"" type of sense - so we shared classes/meals/beds/clothes/money etc.) 
 Now during all of this A and I had another close friend who happened to be in the same major as me and our age who I'll call M. He, unlike A, was more social and was a Catholic (at the time) like I was which was really cool. He was also in a long term relationship that he had kept since highschool, so it had never felt awkward to hang around him since he was a friend of both A and myself. Because M and I were both dating other people it was never weird and we ended up hanging out with one another all the time, with him as a sort of brother figure to me. 
 Okay so fast forward to this past October. 
A and I were hitting rough patches. Although we weren't fighting A just didn't seem interested in putting any effort into our relationship.We had always been shakey with intimate aspects and he wasn't willing to talk about his emotions or feelings with things as they progressed. Essentially every argument we had turned into me talking to a brick wall. 
 On the other hand M and I started getting closer and closer due to the amount of projects we had to do in our classes together. His relationship was getting rocky with her girlfriend and we would both talk to one another and give advice to one another about what to do with our significant figures. 
 Then it happened. One day while the two of us were working on a project for class M looks at me with a serious expression and confesses he has  had feelings for me for the past three years and that he can see us having a future together . My immediate response was to be like WTF, but I couldnt lie, I had feeling for him too. That best friend line gets blurry and he's attractive. But I told him it wouldnt work since I was committed to the relationship I was already in with A. He agreed and we said we would keep it professional. 
 Fast forward again and he breaks up with his girlfriend. I decided I should be honest with my current boyfriend A and tell him about my feelings for M and ask him what he thinks is best for us, and A locks up, freaks out and gets hostile with me and tells me that I deserve better than him and to go off with M. I explain that it's not like that and long story short we break up. 
 Now it's been a month later and I'm a wreck. I'm in a busy major and I keep pretty quiet so these two boys were the people I considered to be my closest friends. A and I tried getting back together but it was out of convenience more than love and we decided it wasn't a good idea. M and I have been growing in our relationship but he continually flips back and forth between being a close friend, to coming onto me sexually to arguing with me, to pushing me away that it's hard to be around him. 
 I still have feelings for them both and because of our class and project overlap I can't avoid proximity. Also due to other circumstances I've been sleeping on their couch between their two loft beds (they are roommates) for the past 3 weeks. 
 I want to tell myself I'm happy w/o a relationship - but it's hard to stay away when I have feelings for them both. 
 Reddit, I'm all messed up. I still love A, and I want to get back together with him, but M is so passionate about life and a future that being with him would be awesome too. What should I do? Should I choose between them or leave them both alone?","I was in a love triangle with my long term boyfriend ""A"" who is very plain, non-exciting, and non-emotionally invested, and ""M"" our close friend who is passionate about everything, but non-steady when it comes to relationships. The two boys are roommates and my closest friends and due to college classes we are in close proximity 24/7.

"Throwaway because my wife is a well-known TwoXer and, while I will be telling her what happened, I don't want her finding out through reddit. 
 My wife and I are in our early 30s. We've been married for 3 years and were together about 3 years before that. Just before the 1 year point, I moved in with her - I will call her D - and my younger sister, who i will call B. Everything was good. My sister's boyfriend - I will call him J - was a bit of an immature frat boy, but her personality and actions forced him to grow up a little. During this time, we all got along like a family and things were good. J and B moved out into their own place and got married soon after...about a year into their relationship. 
 Pressure from D's family and mine started to mount a bit and we decided to get married as well. I was a bit apprehensive at the time but i feel like I made the right choice as I love D. A couple of years went by, possessions and pets were collected alongside the memories and, by and large, things were great. During this time, I began working as an Sys admin for a local company and she took on a job that called for her to travel 3-4 weeks per year (dont want to id the profession since she's posted about work). We were still hanging out pretty frequently with J&B as well as the rest of her family. 
 Abruptly in March, J&B stopped coming over. We were all still cordial, chatting online and at family functions but they refused any and all invitations to hang out. At first it was negligible, then a little odd but finally it became a little awkward. No explanations were given but we decided that, since things were still friendly, they simply must be branching out on their own a bit and hanging out with new friends. We hadn't really invited them over in about three months when this weekend happened. 
 Typically, I work 8-10 hour days Sunday-Thursday. Last week, I exchanged shifts with a co-worker who needed Friday off for some family function and got a rare Sunday off. Meanwhile, D got a call from a client...she was needed out of town between saturday through tonight for some work. I was super pumped for a bachelor weekend...Beers were plentiful, we'd just picked up an ounce of weed and I just got a copy of Arkham City so my weekend seemed planned. Saturday went about as well as planned between drinking and college football. I was just settling in for a Sunday of gaming when I got a text. 
 ""Can we come hang out?"" B had texted me. It had been a long time since I'd seen the two of them so I let her know D was out of town but they were welcome to come smoke a joint and play some Kinect. Some time later, she texted me back that J wouldn't be able to make it but she still wanted to come over. Everything seemed ok when she showed up with a bottle of wine and we started playing Mario Kart or something. We polished off the liter of wine she brought and popped another one. At some point, I became aware of her leg pushing into mine. I didn't think much about it. Several rounds of MK later, she mentioned that D had recommended the film No Country for Old Men and wanted to know if I'd watch with her. I put the film on and and there we were, drinking wine and watching a movie. 
 She started to cuddle up to me which wasn't too far removed from our roommate days or when we were growing up. i was pretty drunk, tired from a long weekend of drinking and was dozing off a bit when I felt her fingers drawing on my leg. I tried to move my leg away and she said something to the effect of, ""is that bothering you?"" I said that it tickled a bit and she asked if I wanted to be tickled more. I'm an extremely ticklish person and she knew this so I started to turtle up a bit when the attack happened. I was pretty annoyed since I just wanted to pass out but she was my sister so I couldn't be too mad about it. I just went with it for a few minutes like the old days. When she stopped tickling, she looked directly at my face in what I feel will be the longest second of my life. It was then I realized what was about to happen but before I could say or do anything, she kissed me. It was clearly not a sisterly kiss. The last thing I remember was pulling back and saying ""wait"", then nothing. 
 I'm not sure if I passed out, blacked out or what but I woke up the next morning curled up on the bed with a vicious wine hangover. At first, I didn't remember anything beyond hanging out with B and smoking some weed. I went for a piss, came back in the room and saw her there, sleeping peacefully. My internal panic level exploded as I realized she was only wearing panties and obvious signs of sex were strewn about the room. I'm talking random clothes, items everywhere, condoms out on the table...the whole shebang. I started freaking out...trying to remember the night before but unable to come up with ANYTHING after she kissed me. I ran for the shower in a half assed attempt to clean myself up. While in there, I heard B scramble out of the apartment....she left no message, hasn't texted or called since. I sent her one message, a simple '?' 
 So, my wife will be home tonight. How do I approach this subject with her? How do I tell her what happened? I had no intention of banging my own sister, much less cheating on my wife. How can I save my marriage from destruction?","wife was out of town, sister came over, we got drunk, i blacked out and we apparently had sex. Fuck.",30,M,AskReddit

"Question 1) Hey guys I been going to the gym for about 2 months now so I'm still a newbie at it, and still trying to learn as much as possible. Everywhere I have read said to engage your Lats while doing pull ups. I don't know what motion it is talking about or how to use them (I'm sure I already am). I have mostly been doing weight lifting machines, while doing a little free weights with it. I'm 6-2"" 290lbs. They have a machine where I can add resistance on it which allows me to do pull ups & dips. 
 I have always had a bad back growing up (accident around 15 years old) but now that I'm working out it feels better and better.

"A former friend of mine. I'm currently a Junior in high school, so I haven't experienced much of what life has to offer, and this story is certainly not as bad as what some people have had to go through, but here goes: 
 I wasn't all that confident in myself when I entered high school as a freshman. In fact, I had some pretty bad self-esteem issues. I got bullied left and right in Elementary and Middle school. No one ever beat me up (surprisingly). Most people were just kind of a dick to me. 
 But anyway, I had very few friends going into high school, and never spoke in any classes until I met this guy. He was a guy I started talking to in my 3rd period class, and he seemed pretty cool. We were into the same video games, anime, tv shows etc. So I got to know this guy and hung out with him a little. He seemed really cool back then, and he was one of my best friends. That was until I realized who he really was 
 He realized that I had low self-esteem early on, and he took advantage of it full force. He would constantly talk about how no one appreciates or cares about me, how people want me dead, but that he was my only friend against the world. He would constantly say bad things about my other (real) friends and other people to try to get me to leave them. 
 This is bad enough, but he himself had serious issues (if that wasn't obvious enough already). He has no concept of accepting the consequences of his actions. He just does what he wants without thinking of what will happen. He stole $150 from his mom in order to buy items for some MMORPG ( EDIT : It was a kiddie MMO that everyone else just kind of dicked around on. Not really a ""real"" MMO). He's actually done this several times. He also does not think about the shit he says before it spews from his mouth. And he's a huge pervert, and proudly told everyone he once jacked off 5 times a day. At lunch. Speaking of lunch, one day he got in some argument with a girl at our table, and it resulted in a rant about how women are stupid and never listen to the words that men say. So he's sexist as well. Great... 
 Something related to the whole ""doesn't think about the consequences of anything"" problem is that he would say and do something worse than usual, and when people confronted him about it, he would act as if he did nothing wrong and that they're wrong for accusing him. This would keep going until he would ""sincerely"" apologize and say that he'd never do something like that ever again. Big fucking lie, right there. It was almost a cycle of things like this. He'd continue being the shit of a person he is, do something particularly terrible, apologize and say he won't do it again. Rinse and repeat. 
 But back to him being a pervert, I think this kid has serious masturbation problems. Look, I understand teenage guys are horny a lot, but this kid was out of control. He had catalogs and catalogs of porn on his computer and phone. And he'd proudly brag about it to everyone. Again, at lunch. And I've already mentioned him bragging about jerking it 5 times in one day. 
 All of this built up over time. My other friends (the friends I realized were my true friends) kept trying to get me to realize he was a piece of shit. But I just didn't listen, because I was somehow still convinced he was a good person. One day, however, he did something that finally set me over the edge. 
 He invited me to a group chat with a few people on skype. I joined but was playing minecraft with someone else at the time, so I didn't really pay attention to the chat at the time. When I was done I looked at the chat. Everyone save for him was freaked out over something. Everyone said he was disgusting. I scrolled up and saw what disturbed everyone. He was bragging about all the types of porn he looked at. This included  CHILD PORN . Something about that set me off. It was so unbelievably disgusting that I couldn't take his bullshit anymore. I exploded, telling him how much of a disgusting human being he was and how he isn't worth anyone's time. He then sent me a bunch of messages about how I should be hated by everyone and should just die. At this point I realized that was bullshit and simply brushed it off. He tried apologizing the next day, but I didn't respond. He's never sincere with his apologies. He's done this too many times for me to care. I decided that I was done with him for good. I haven't spoken to him since. 
 Since then I've realized who my real friends are, and that most people do enjoy my company. My self-esteem issues are pretty much gone, and I've been much happier ever since.","Friend"" emotionally abuses me and is a disgusting sociopath. Brags about being into kiddy porn.

"This is a long convoluted story but I will try to consolidate it as much as possible. Growing up my parents were foster parents to many kids through the years. The girl I'm talking about (I'll call her Lisa) was with us on and off for years and I consider her family. 
 Lisa is now 21 and has two kids. She has had her share of hard knocks but remains a good kid who adores her children. She has had intermittent contact with her biological mother (I'll call her Bitch) who is pretty much evil. Bitch tries to convince Lisa that she is a bad daughter, a bad mother, a bad person. Bitch is HIV positive and regularly guilts Lisa into giving her money and taking care of her (despite abandoning Lisa with her abusive father when Lisa was 4 years old). 
 Lisa holds onto hope that her mother will change and that she will eventually love Lisa. Unfortunately this is really common with foster kids - the hope that if they are just good enough, successful enough, nice enough...their bio-parents will stop being pieces of shit and will love them and parent them. 
 Fast forward to now - Bitch had surgery last week and convinced Lisa to come take care of her while she was recuperating. In short order she started pulling her usual shit - screaming at Lisa, blaming her for being in pain, etc. Lisa tried to leave with the kids but Bitch grabbed Lisa's oldest daughter and refused to let her go. The police were called and Bitch was told to keep her hands off the kids. 
 Lisa is stuck in Syracuse with a 3-month old and a 3-year with no car and almost no money. Even if I could send bus tickets she has too much stuff (car seats, portable crib, etc.). I am worried that her mother will start being physically abusive to Lisa again.

"My sister has to be one of the meanest, most unpleasant people I have ever met. When we were little she was nice. Her behavior started to change when she was about 19, and it has gotten worse as the years have gone by. 
 She makes it completely impossible for me to get along with her. If I am hanging out with her she acts like I am a bother to her, even if she was the one who invited me to hang out. She will bury her face in her phone and text nonstop and laugh out loud, making it obvious that she wants to be noticed. If I try to start a conversation with her, she will look up from her phone with a snotty smirk on her face and say, ""what?"" and then go back to texting. Every time I hang out with her I feel like I'm walking on eggshells. Every word that comes out of my mouth she is ready to attack. If we go to a store and I am looking at something she gets an attitude out of nowhere. One time I was trying on a pair of sunglasses and I turned around to ask her what she thought but she was gone. I walked down a few aisles and asked her where she went. She said, ""Um, you don't need sunglasses and I'm ready to leave. You can come with me now, or you can figure out a different way to get home."" She makes nasty little remarks nonstop and tried to make me feel clueless and inferior to her. It's almost as if she has a pattern. She will come up with a nasty remark and she will repeat it for about a month, and then when you hang out with her she'll have a new nasty remark that she will use for a certain period of time. It's really bizarre. Like her current one is about my eating habits. She came over to my place and I was about to make some food for us. I asked her if chicken was okay and she said, ""Didn't you have hamburgers last night?"" I said, ""Yes"" and she remarks ""Oh, wow (snotty laugh) I hardly ever eat meat. It seems like you guys eat meat everyday. I just don't do that, but you know how you are."" 
 Last month she asked me if I wanted to meet her at Starbucks for coffee and I said sure. I met up with her and we sat and talked. Somewhere in our conversation I mentioned how I want to have 3 kids someday. She looks right at me and says in her snottiest tone, ""Haha, oh my God, are you serious? That's disgusting."" Obviously this comment upset me but I didn't know how to respond so I just changed the subject. I was sick of her treating me this way so when she invited me out for her birthday with her friends I ended up not coming. She turned it around and said I am rude and disrespectful for not coming. I told her I chose not to come because she is rude to me and because she has also gotten her friends to mistreat me. She told me, ""oh right because I'm such a bitch. Whatever, you're ridiculous."" One of her male friends was pretty nasty to me for no reason and on a few occasions he had called me a fucking bitch and a cunt. My sister considers herself a feminist. When I asked her why she didn't stand up for me since she hung out with this person a few days after he called me these names, she said, ""Because you irritate people. you probably annoyed him."" 
 She forms opinions of me that are not true and then tells me them constantly. She tells me, ""LGBT rights are very important to me and I didn't invite you out last Friday with some people because I didn't want you to be uncomfortable around drag queens."" This angered me because I am a supporter of the LGBT community. She also told me that I am a mean person and irresponsible and would not make a good parent and that if I am able to have kids and a career she will be very surprised. She said ""having kids and a career is difficult but obviously not impossible because I know some amazing women who do both. But, I really don't think you can handle both, sorry."" I decided that I am going to go back to school for a bachelors degree. I mentioned it to her and she started with the insults, telling me, ""Um, you know that will be a lot of work right? I mean, you are already 29 and you want kids. I'm sorry but unlike you I got my bachelors degree (in fashion design 5 years ago and she is making $12) and I know who I am."" I told her that she should be supportive of me wanting to go back to school to better my life and she got irritated and said, ""You are ridiculous. you are fucking 29 years old and you think you need to go back to school all of a sudden. You need to get your fucking shit together. This is why i don't like hanging out with you."" 
 This was long, but I really needed to share my experience with everyone. it really upsets me how toxic her behavior is towards me and any help or insight would be appreciated. I have tried to ask my family to convince her to seek help but everyone says she is an adult and that she will not listen to anyone.","My sister mistreats me, verbally abuses me, and insults me.

"Here's some background on my grooming: I, despite my physical disabilities, was always instructed by N's to be nurturing, and being a caregiver was always in my ""job description"" since I was as young as 4 years old. I took care of grandma while she was dying, I took care of Nsis when she broke her arm 4-5 times, and I was to clean and cook the best I could, and take care of myself while in a wheelchair in a nonaccessible house. 
 Nmom did step in when I absolutely couldn't (having two broken legs, full body cast, etc) and did the bare minimum. Around 10, my health got better,  and Nmom had a ""whoops"" pregnancy. She was then laid off,  and despite that,  I was tasked with taking care of the baby when I wasn't at school, even while doing homework (he's 9 now and still calls me mom when he's not paying attention). She had another three years later- and was in college. I was taking care of a three year old and newborn, and a house without any help- Nsis was 19 at this point and gave no fucks, unless i didn't cook dinner- and I was still wheelchair/walker dependent. Nmom was more involved with baby number 2, after pediatrician (the boys, not mine, I never had one, just what help Shriners would give) told my mom that he needed surgery, ASAP. He had a malformation of his skull, and had two surgeries at 18 months and 24 months. It was regarded as my fault, despite this being genetic and related to the mutation my mom has and passed down to 3 out of 4 of us. He has Autism and is doing well, and still calls me mom all the time, and Nmom can't even lash out at him without everyone calling her out as the jerk she is. I'm still living with the N's, my brothers,  and my S.O. who moved in to help me. 
 Anyways,","background: I've been groomed to nurture and be loving to anyone deemed worthy by my parents without reciprocation (which is why I went as far as writing college essays at 13 for both my mother and sister), and basically raised myself and siblings. 
 Other than the brothers I've raised, I've never really received love and support in any familial relationship, and I'm currently in a loving, supportive relationship, and I just can't trust it. I trust him,  but I recently reinjured an ankle after being aid free for several years (no wheelchair, crutches, etc). I'm walking with a walker,  and I can't carry things like drinks or food, I need help cooking, and help getting in and out of the shower,  etc. I keep waiting for the resentment, or a ""why don't you just fucking try doing it yourself"", or a thrown object or yelling when I ask for help. I know he isn't the type and has never done any of that,  but this injury and the possibility of having to have another surgery looming over me is making me regress to my mentality when my Nparents were worse. 
I just don't know how to process that someone actually, really loves me. That someone would move in to help me with two little brothers, despite knowing my parents. That someone understands my reluctance to leave,  because of my brothers' wellbeing and the extent of neglect my parents put me through. It blows my freaking mind that it's not only possible, but is actually happening.

"I guess I'll start with this; so nobody here potentially wastes their time.  At this point, I still try for the sake of saying ""I tried"", but I honestly, legitimately don't believe I'm helpable.

 So I'm 27, turning 28 in a couple weeks, with almost 0 dating experience.  The only date I've been on was a pity date with a friend who dragged me out on my 21st birthday when she found out I wasn't doing anything. 
 On the side of me being the pursuer, I have a flat out 100% rejection rate.  This comes from a variety of methods.  Whether it's meeting a new girl and asking for her number the same day, or someone I've known and at some point developed some sort of feelings as I've gotten to know them. 
 I've tried PoF and OkCupid with no success; and apps like Tinder as well. 
 I even had a platonic friend that I hung out with regularly for a couple of years stop talking to me for about half a year because she THOUGHT I liked her. 
 I've tried being myself.  I've tried being someone else.  I've been everywhere from bars/clubs to trying to meet someone on local meet ups or volunteering and the interest has always been completely one sided. 
 I even had a girl ask me out once, which resulted in her canceling three times and then she ended up dating my lab partner from a class I was in (4 years later and they're still together, lol) 
 Aside from up just straight up getting amnesia and getting a new personality, I really feel like I don't have any hope of ever finding someone.

"This is complicated and I know I shouldn't be involved technically, but he's my dad and I love him. I'm 19F, he's 53M and my stepmom is 54F...and she's a monster. When I was 4, my dad began the divorce process from my mom. She abused drugs, cheated on him, stole from my college account, and disrespected him daily. I am a person that is not against divorce if needed and I'm glad my dad had the courage to leave my biological mother, even if I have forgiven her. Anyway, When I was 11 he met his future wife. He had been dating for a while online when she messaged him. After the first month of dating, he was talking about marriage with her and we were already planning our lives around her. I was upset I had to change my life the most by moving, but I thought it was worth it because I'd finally have a real mother around instead of nannies. 
 Fast forward 2 years. They finally move into a house together, the one only she wanted...no surprise there. The first strange thing I noticed was that she complained about back problems and said she can't sleep with him in the same room and that they'd switch using the master bedroom every other week. 1. The switching deal never happened. 2. She had no problem sleeping in the same bed for the 9 months they dated and year they were engaged. Even on their wedding night, my dad slept alone in the small guest bedroom that didn't even have a real dresser. Second strange thing I noticed was on the wedding day, she ordered pizza in. I sat down to one of the plates of pizza and started eating. She scolded me and was ready to punish me for stealing her slice. I honestly thought it was just set at the table like normal mothers do...I shrugged it off and didn't think anything of it. 
 Now, fast forward into my freshman year. My dad is sleeping alone every night in the guest room, his permanent room by then, she shows way too clear favoritism with her son [which yes that's her son but she shouldn't make the way she treats him obvious], her and my father constantly argue over the dumbest things, she has access to his major accounts and bills and goes on shopping  sprees, and she has arguments with me over the littlest things to the point I'm afraid to come home. My stepbrother would ignore me in the halls and tell people I was a bitch even though he didn't know me and my stepmom would have arguments early in the morning with my father about ""his daughter"" that I'd wake up and overhear and then cry myself back to sleep. Many time's she's blamed her faults with my dad on me and her arguments on me. One week I was diagnosed with manic depression and she was yelling at me and ignoring me because I was crying after my diagnosis. 
 Anyway, fast forward a few more months, she picks another argument in front of me and starts yelling at me in front of my dad. He is over weight and unhappy at this point and tells her to get the fuck out because he wanted a divorce. She pulled him outside and told him she didn't mean it and they stayed together. This happened 2 more times. 
 I have a lot of stories about how she mis treated me and my dad but let me get down to the point. I'm in college now, but I'm still tormented by her and I still know what happens to my dad even though I'm 4 hours away. There were complications over an issue to study abroad that was only between me and my father since the finances for my education come from a separate account. She got involved by eavesdropping, forcing herself on the phone, and texting me. I told my father it wasn't right of her to disrespect my privacy. He said ""well she is your stepmother"" and I said ""well she's not my mother."" and She was still eavesdropping. She screamed ""too bad that's how I parent. I'm sick of your manipulation shit."" She then goes on to send me harassing text messages calling me spoiled, immature, entitled to everything, and began to threaten me. This is my most recent trouble with her. I went home for a doctors appointment and she told my father she was purposely ignoring me. I didn't see or hear from her for 2 days and her bedroom is located next to mine. 
 Meanwhile, my father has become more quiet, has told me to not call the house phone anymore since we won't have privacy, compromises to everything she wants but she does not return the favor, and he's overweight and constantly exhausted. They sleep in separate bedrooms, go on separate vacations, only see each other at night, they argue over the dumbest things, she turns separate issues with me into marital issues, she goes on constant shopping sprees bragging that he doesn't notice what she spends, she mentally abuses both of us, and keeps him from his family. She hates my grandma and cousins and keeps him from seeing the majority of his family. If he does see them, he goes on his own without her. She wants no part in my family. Are these grounds for divorce? I honestly can't take it anymore. I can't stand her and I hate seeing my father go through this. It bothers me that even though I'm 4 hours away it still hurts me because she has control over my father and over my life still. I don't like seeing him this unhappy and afraid to leave her. He told me he'd rather be with her than be alone and that a second divorce wouldn't be good. He said no woman would want a man with 2 divorces under his belt...which isn't true. He's a smart handsome guy who works on wallstreet. Any single woman his age would die for a chance with him and he has no idea. The divorce isn't my say of course...but does he have grounds for one and how can I help him through it if he decides to get one?","My father is in an unhappy marriage with a woman that mentally abuses him, goes on shopping sprees with his money, argues with him over the dumbest things, turns separate issues with me into marital issues, goes on separate vacations, sleeps in a separate bedroom, only sees him at night, and keeps him from his family.",19,F,BreakUps
"What went wrong? Everything. 
 Took the most beautiful, sporty, gorgeous girl home. Start getting on the good foot and doing the bad thing - only to immediately work out this bomb shell is  incredibly self conscious. I try to set the mood (I don't wanna just jam it straight in), so foreplay is a must I think. I quickly learned I am not allowed to touch her anywhere. Do you know how hard it is to lose your virginity without even so much as getting a finger wet? Difficult to say the least. I am nervous, as is she, so at this point its just awkward making out whilst I'm trying to get her naked. 
 Therein lies the next problem - because she doesn't want to be touched, clearly she doesn't want to be naked. So off come the clothes, whilst hands are strategically placed. Seriously, no boob action, not allowed to touch her vagina, and so far I have seen the grand total of her naked stomach. Hot I know. 
 At this point this losing my virginity thing isn't seeming all it is cracked up to be. And to make matters worse, I now have to be Dr Phil/A Virgin all at the same time. I'm god damn counselling her just so I can see her boobs. It's become time to officially lose my V's (still haven't seen boobs btw), and I slap a condom on. Turns out (as I assume everyone else here now knows) that nerves, and choking your cock in latex results in a rather limp wand.
Now I am fucking (I use that term lightly) a girl who is on top, covering her breasts, in a dark room, with me simultaneously counselling her about her beauty whilst trying to keep my own cock erect. 
 One worked/one didn't. I finally did see those glorious bastards, but counselling took its toll and I was literally trying to jam a cock with the stiffness of a wet paper bag into her glory hole. 
 She decides to work it up manually. Trust me honey, if losing my virginity wasn't doing it, jacking me off with that awkward style isn't gonna save the day. After what seemed like an eternity, I work up the courage to move her hand off my cock, and replace it with my own. That's right, I am now masturbating myself, in front of the girl I just lost my virginity to. Talk about getting comfortable quickly. 
 So there she is - awkwardly covering her breasts again, while I try to catch a peak of her face/tits/ass/anything in the moon light creeping through the window, jacking my limp ass dick off myself. In the end (and it took a while), I jacked it until i was literally a bees dick away from blowing. Honestly, a fucking breath of fresh air could have finished the job at this point -  so like the gentleman I am, I hand the reigns back to her (ie grab her hand put it on the stick). 
 I blow - we awkwardly lie in bed for another 15 minutes, not knowing what to say. She gets up, leaves - and that's the day I lost my virginity.","She wouldn't let me see her naked, I had to counsel her to even see nip, my first experience with a condom and nerves left me limp.

"For a decade (14 to 24, almost down the month, actually) I was on hormonal birth control, Ortho Tri Cyclen. I've never had a problem with acne, blemishes, redness, or pores unless I had a reaction to lotion or makeup (more on that below). 
 To make a long story short, I had a very difficult year in 2012 and in July, I noticed A LOT of shedding and my hair is now noticeably thinner. I knew stress, and not birth control, was probably the culprit, but I wanted to be sure. I quit the pill and now use a copper IUD. 
 For the first time in my life, I'm getting hormonal acne, random zits, redness all around my face and cystic acne on my chin that, apparently, never really wants to go away. 
 Makeup, instead of being one of those things I would have to be ""in the mood"" to apply in the morning, is now a necessity for my self-esteem, for me to feel like I look like myself.

"Ugh. Boys are dumb. I'm at 10 weeks and am exhausted all of the time, nauseous most of the time, and vomiting some of the time. I also have a mentally, physically, and emotionally taxing full-time job.

I just couldn't come up with anything we would both eat in our woefully under-stocked kitchen. I told him this when he got home, sorry hun.

"I met him at the department store I work at. He let me pick a fortune in commission of clothes and then he left his number. A lot of people think, oh, you are in it for the money- but I'm not. He has this intense way of listening and slight reserve that sort of fascinated me. I had never met anyone like him. He's highly attractive if you go for the Adrian Brody type (And I do). He is in great shape,  he has a wicked, sarcastic sense of humor, and he's extremely smart. My encyclopedia boyfriend. 
 We started dating and things went very quickly. Like, after the second date those nice clothes I picked out were on my floor. The only time we had sex at my place, actually, he prefers his. It's weird but it's our one year anniversary and I just realized how much of our relationship relies on his preferences. 
 I cut my hours majorly back at work. ""Don't you want more time for this?"" He asked. And since I moved in, within 3 months, and he refused my money so I didn't -need- the hours. He bought me a new phone and a new car. ""It's a matter of safety."" 
 Anything I like, or even look at too long, he gets for me. It's baffling and enticing and odd but it's one of the ways he expresses his affection and he gets very offended if I say no or reject it. The same level of offended he gets when I don't return his calls or texts. Or the level he got when a friend made an inappropriate pass at me or when he found out one of mine had been calling him a tacky nickname. 
 Last night was our one year anniversary, he works insane hours but we had a nice day off together. It was delightful. Then he suggested I quit my job entirely. ""I don't want you working for peasant's pay at that store where men drool on you. I can more than support you. Why don't you go back to college? I'll pay and it's better hours. This way we can have lunch together."" 
 And I agreed. I didn't say, well, what if you leave me? I didn't say, I like my job and I'm good at it. I just said that would be nice and let him starting talking about how he wanted to sail more this summer and he could take a week off..etc,etc. 
 I just agreed. It's weird. I don't know how to say no to him. At all.

"Religion saved my life. 
 When I was a kid, my parents were heavy into drugs and alchohol.  I was 4 years old, feeding myself and my 1 year old brother cold hot dogs from the fridge so we wouldn't go hungry while my mom suffered withdrawls because they didn't have money for more speed. 
 Wow... when I put it that way, it sounds way more fucked up then I remember it...  I have a daughter who is about to turn 3, pregnant with kid number 2, and I cannot imagine my daughter caring for anybody, let alone a baby...  I digress. 
 When I was 5, I made friends with another little girl from a very religious family.  Through some catholic guilt on my mother's part, and some way-too-cute behaviour on my part, my family ""got saved"" and started going to church.  My parents cleaned up- my dad even stopped smoking cigarettes when I was 12, cold turkey. 
 My point is more that I owe religion a debt of gratitude.  All the rules and guilt saved my young life. 
 It wasn't till after I was 30, and had spent more than 7 years away from all my religious friends, ""lived in sin"" and gone through some major life changes (marriage, kids, unemployment, welfare, atheist friends) that I began to analize even more (don't get me started on high school).  What did I actually believe?  What had I experianced in my young Christian life?  What was lacking now?  Why didn't I feel like I used to??? 
 I cannot deny what I went through.  I think it is silly to believe so strongly in coincidence, but I have the intelligence to admit I could be completely wrong.  I don't believe the Bible, I don't like how humans ruin beautiful ideas of religion and turn it into some kind of high-schoolesque clique popularity contest (yeah, there's a little bitterness with that one, but I'm cool). 
 I've decided I believe in me.  I believe in what I see, hear, experiance.  If it makes sense, I will adopt it into what I think/believe.  If you cannot prove it to me, it is your opinion/thought and deserves to be taken as such and not ""the gospel truth.""  Agnostic describes me best. 
 Mankind if fallable.  How can I trust something like my life here on Earth, and a possible afterlife to just heresay and opinion of people I don't actually know??? 
 I -think- there is a god.  Of some kind.  Who likely works in ways that would translate to our real world rules about physics, etc. and that we just haven't figured it all out yet, and we might never. 
 I pride myself on being open-minded, a listener, a learner, and a thinker.  The best label I have is agnostic and honestly I am sick of athiests telling me I will be one of them some day- no.  Jeez, the Christians I have told have been more understanding than them!  I picked this title on purpose because it suits me best- back off.","Religion guilted my druggy parents into cleaning up so I owe such ideas some respect.

I said it's up to him, and he postponed rekindling his relationship with his ex until pretty much the day I boarded the plane, when he came with my family and friends to see me off. 
 Anyway, we stayed mates for the year I was away, and emailed and chatted a lot while I was gone. Some weird shit happened though when me, him and his now girlfriend all started getting emails from some anonymous third party who kept telling ALL of us that he and I were meant to be together, and telling the girlfriend to back off etc. etc. We never figured out who it was, but I told them if they really were my friend (like they claimed) they'd know that there wasn't anything between us anymore. Anyway, because of this, the girlfriend became a bit paranoid about what was going to happen when I came back. 
 When I did come back to Australia, she sent me an email asking me to please not take the guy away from her. I was a bit insensitive, and sent a rather scathing reply back about how I had no intention of doing so, and was moving to another city for university etc. 
 Anyway, a few other things happened, and the guy (who I was still friends with) tried to organise for us to all hang out together, but it was a complete failure, and some nasty things were said by some of my friends (which, shamefully, I did nothing to prevent) and our friendship was ruined. 
 Now he and the girlfriend are now happily married with two boys. I emailed him about a year ago and apologised for being such an insensitive bitch, and we've emailed a bit back and forth since.","Had a fuck buddy who wanted to get back with his ex. I went overseas, they reconciled. She was paranoid, I was indifferent, he wanted us all to be friends. Backfired, friendship over. They're now married with kids.

"It is very hard for me to make friends and even harder to make close friends, always has been and I would like to change that! Also I generally make friends in nerdy type circles (anime, video game, comics etc.)  I'll be moving across country in a month or two to move in with my boyfriend and try to find a professional job with my masters degree. I need friends outside my boyfriend so I don't go totally nuts and so I can do things with others that he doesn't like to do (like go to movies). And if it makes a difference 23/f. 
 I moved from my college town to my new graduate school city and made friends in the usual way you make friends at a school- joined a lot of clubs that interested me and talked to people in my classes. I spent two years slowly and awkwardly building a few friendships but overall I ended up not making as many friends as I did with the same methods as in college. I was a little disappointed but I had a few friends, homework, and a job so I wasn't too lonely, I also chalked it up to being a much bigger school than my last school.  First question: How do I go about making friends in a work/professional environment without clubs to help me weed out people with similar interests? Possibly also outside work?  I am pretty much totally lost here. 
 I also recently found out that I don't get invited to many things because I dress a little strange. I feel a little uncomfortable posting my picture but this is the general style I dress [this is a famous model]( and [not me]( No I do not wear these clothes to work but yes I wear them as much as I can elsewhere. Soon I plan to forgo pants altogether and wear cute casual dresses/skirts as well as this style. Apparently this is off-putting to some people. When I found out about this I was a little hurt but overall felt that it was ok because the way I dress is something I care deeply about I'd rather not have friends that at least can overlook it if not appreciate it. While this doesn't bother me per say I know I could lose friends over it so,  second question: is there a way to be better personality wise so that more people would WANT to overlook my particular clothing choices?  I thought I was doing pretty good but apparently not. 
 I feel like I've made a few mistakes in the general friend making department by being a combination of awkward penguin, blunt/dispassionate about people, and just plain being lazy. I know how to fix the lazy but I'd like to try to be much less awkward penguin in social situations since I will be fixing the lazy!

"I'm a fifteen year old girl in her sophomore year of high school. I've always thought females were pretty attractive, but thought it was relatively normal. Now I'm starting to question that. I've called myself ""bicuriouscurious"" for a while, but I think I'm about ready to commit to not quite being committed (to being bicurious, if I'm not making any sense). I think I'm heteroromantic though. I can only see myself getting married to a man, but I think girls are pretty attractive. I guess I'm just not sure. I might ask my bisexual friend about it, if she doesn't find it offensive (she's pretty cool so it shouldn't be a problem!). I don't even know entirely what I'm doing making this post. I just went and subscribed to a whole bunch of LGBT-related subreddits in hopes that it will help me find myself. Anyways, I guess I'll go back to talking about the actual subject. 
 I've always been fine with homosexuality. I am in a Christian family. We used to go to church regularly, but I guess we've gotten busy and we don't really go anymore but continue with our beliefs. I got into an argument with my mom a few months ago about what on earth is wrong with being homosexual. It's love, and that's all there is to it. Well, those are my beliefs. At first I just questioned if I wasn't actually Christian, but I think I am and just don't agree with some things. 
 I quickly became adamant about gay rights after this, and Macklemore's ""Same Love"" really spoke to me. I went to his concert in late October and two women got engaged on stage. I think the concert kind of sparked something in me. I've been thinking about it for a long time, and I finally think I am bicurious. I just don't know what to do about it. 
 I've had a few boyfriends, but that's all. I don't currently have one. I've been considering joined the GSA, but am not sure which I would sign up as. I also don't know if my parents would be too happy about it. Oh, and I'd have to drop gaming club, which would kind of suck. I have no clue if this is just hormones either. I don't think so, but I really can't be sure. I want to experiment, I guess, but have no clue where I would start. I don't really want a serious relationship, honestly. Just something for fun. To try it out, you know?

"Hello, everybody! First, let me share a brief context: 
 I've met a girl [18 F] september last year and we started dating... All good, but she didnt want anything serious. That was (and is as we actually keep dating and have our intimacy) something very painful to know as i started to love her and we get so along is unreal, even met her parents and such. I feel like all the things i've ever had with any girl was actually a search for something greater and i really feel like i need someone, i see all the couples getting happy, people whom have someone to call later night to find peace after a rush during the day or people who can simply spend the night together knowing that in the morning the other will still be there. 
 1- At my age, is that normal? The Needness? I mean, i see people older looking for a ''settle'' but not young people. 
 2- Did you ever feel like you needed someone so bad even being so young? If so, this feeling did grow or vanished as the time went past and you got more experienced? 
 3- Should i stay with her just to see what will happen or try to find someone who really wants something other than casual dating and friendship? What would you do? Shes a good friend but the idea of she meeting others (as well as me meeting others) while im wanting her is really painful for me. And im not proud of it. 
 She wants casual dating, but i really dont like the idea...Thats the problem. At my age every boy wants to hook up with any beautiful girl, but i don't. I really feel this need to have someone and dont know if its normal for a young person or if its my nature and im doomed to suffer from it all my life.

"This whole thing started Sunday night. I was at my bestfriend's  house just hanging out like any other day, but I didn't realize that I would stumble across something amazing that night. So my friend and I were just playing Overwatch together when her older sister walks in and says she needs to ask me something. I said ok and followed her into the next room. She began to explain that she wanted to pickup her company van and get a ""toy replacement"", and wanted to know if I could drive her to do so (I'm 18 and she's 24). So I said sure while remembering I filled up on gas before I got to their house. She decided that she wanted to get the ""toy replacement first"". Now this is where it gets interesting. We pull up to the local adult store and she says can you come in with me. When she said that I was beginning to think this was more than her just wanting to get a ""toy replacement"" . I'm sure you're wondering ""why would you think that?"" Well her behavior was different while talking in the car and I could tell something was up. So when we get in the store she looks at some lingerie and starts to pick out the ones that she wants. I start to think to myself ""why does she want me to come in here and look at her pick out lingerie?"" After that we walk over to the dildos and vibrators and she picks out her ""toy replacement"". She then motions for one of the employees to come over to us. The dude comes over and says ""How can I help you?"" She says ""yeah I want to see if this toy works"". I shit you not. While the guy is not even 4 feet away from us she asks in a very sweet voice "" do you want to be fuckbuddies?""I turn and look her thinking to myself ""did I just here that right?"" I respond by saying ""yeah sure"". I haven't been 18 for that long, so I didn't know if that was normal conversation while being in an adult store. What's more surprising to me is that the guy making sure her new ""toy replacement"" is working properly is not phased by what she just said to me at all. She pays for her things and we leave. I didn't really know what to say in the car, so I kinda waited for her to say something. I'm not an idiot. The thing is that I have only had girlfriends but never a fuckbuddy. She broke the silence by saying ""so do you know a good spot?"" I said yeah while thinking about where I took my most recent gf when she was horny despite not having a house to do anything in. I take her to this huge parking lot by a track and she says that she wants to give me a bj. After she said that I thought to myself ""I AM THE LUCKIEST GUY ON THE PLANET!"" Not only did she want to please me above anything else, she also says that ( and this was icing on the cake) that she wants to swallow my cum. I've probably have had 2 serious gfs that hated the idea of swallowing cum. She gives me a bj and swallows just like she said she would. Being in the moment I said lets fuck RIGHT NOW. She then said no we should do it when we have more time. My brain was going crazy thinking of all the things I could do to her with no strings attached. I quickly said we can do everything at my house. Now this is where I feel like a fucked up. I still live with my mom and little brother. However my mom is at work all day and my brother is at school until 4 in the afternoon, but I feel like my neighbors might start wondering who is coming over so much during the morning. I don't want my mom to end up finding out from some nosy neighbor that I've been doing the dirty with a woman that is 6 years older than me. So my questions for you are should I find a different place to fuck my new found fuckbuddy, or just ignore my neighbors and do as I please?","I am 18 and got my first fuckbuddy that is 24.

"Thought I'd contribute my story and progress so far. 
 I was introduced to porn at 13 and have masturbated ever since. I'm 22 and in college now. I've experienced pretty severe social anxiety and depression on and off, though I've never wanted for attention from gorgeous women. This has lead to a life full of regrets...I've let many, many beautiful women get away because I was too timid or shy to initiate or pursue anything, as much as I wanted to. I was sedated and fell into an odd, shallow contentment with my isolation from the fairer sex. I've literally had my pick of stunners but lacked the confidence to pursue. To hunt. I still am in some ways...but I feel that shedding. That's not  who I am  deep down. 
 I've had one girlfriend. Lost my virginity to her. I'm single now. 
 Awhile ago I read about nofap on a forum and found this subreddit, lurked for a bit. The awesome community and TED talk vid convinced me to give this a try. 11 days in and I'm feeling great. 
 Benefits I've noticed so far: 
 I feel bolder. Definitely a bit more confident. 
 I'm a bit more productive, not incredibly so. 
 I'm far less content with the bullshit in my life and unwilling to settle or take shit. 
 I'm hornier, obviously. I feel this is palpable to women though. 
 My dreams are AWESOME. I usually have really shitty possession dreams, or dreams with this overbearing sense of doom and death. Wet dreams are an awesome change of pace. 
 More energy. 
 I've also noticed I'm attracting more female attention than usual. Today I was by myself in the quad on campus talking to my grandmother on the phone. Three girls out of the blue sit next to me and start talking about girl stuff. They eye fucked me the ENTIRE CONVERSATION. Sent a bunch of ""approach me!"" signs my way. I loved every second of it even though the attention was a bit overwhelming. I got some bad news over phone though (death of a cousin) so I really wasn't in the mood to socialize or get a number after. I should have and I'm kicking myself for it...but the old me would have had a panic attack on the spot if I dared to stay, or fled immediately. Instead, I continued my conversation...and I reveled in their lust. I left the quad a bit hunched over, head held high...if you get my drift. 
 I'd say nofap is worth it. I allowed porn and masturbation to alter my brain chemistry and sexuality negatively for far too long. I'm done with that shit. And I'm done letting 10s find other guys. I feel like through nofap I'm chasing good health and my inner alpha. 
 Whats really helped me so far is focusing on my career and self improvement. I started reading  The Book of Pook  and  Think and Grow Rich  the day I started nofap and I feel like I'm on the precipice of a massive internal revolution. Beyond that, exercising my willpower is all I've done to resist the addiction. I haven't looked at porn at all, nor have I blocked anything.

"I don't know if I buy this. I am going to let loose a little bit of personal information... 
 I have been addicted to porn since I was about 8, when I first discovered it online. I would stay up for hours beating off while my parents slept in the other room. I am now 19 and still addicted to porn, sometimes masturbating multiple times a day. 
 I have the exact opposite of E.D...severe premature ejaculation. Now, I don't know if this is all attributed to my porn my habits, but it's pretty bad. Literally, the first sexual encounter I had, a girl was grinding on me and she made me jizz in my pants twice. It was extremely embarrassing. 
 Fast forward a few years, I am 16 and finally ready to lose my virginity. NOPE! SORRY BUDDY, says the penis, IM GOING TO JIZZ IN YOUR PANTS. This was a ongoing issue for a few months, before I finally lost my virginity in a legit and traditional manner. Since then I've been building my sexual confidence, and just had amazing sex the other night with the second girl ever, and it was wonderful..not sure why I'm explaining all this, except that if you are a man with severe P.E. there is still hope!

"Hello again guys. It's been a while since I last posted something on NoFap. I have a little problem with myself, with my self-esteem, with my social life and with my porn using. Luckily I'm currently 24 days pornfree, but there is another problem with me. 
 But first of all, a little backstory. I'm 23, and I live in the flat with my parents and 35 years old brother. I was never sexually attracted to any girl - only esthetically. I think that the main reason for this is that when I was 11 or 12 I accidentally found my brother's fapfolder on our computer. This folder was filled with porn, mostly blowjobs, cumshots and facials. I basically discovered how to masturbate by watching these videos. I watched it a lot. It was fun, it was extremely exciting, it was my dirty little secret. From that time I presume, my sexuality was folded, twisted and turned upside down. 
 When I went to middle school (I was 13) I wasn't able to get friends, I wasn't popular kid, I started to have self-esteem problems. Even though I was attracted to some girls I've never had guts to do something with that - I was feeling like human garbage, so I thought I'd just watch porn instead of trying. When I went to high school (I was 16), nothing changed. I only watched porn more frequently than before. 
 When I was 20 I had my first romance. I believed I was in love with her, and for the first time of ages I was feeling great and full of life, joy and happiness. But it turned out, that I am not able to ejaculate whatsoever. Soon our relationship was over, and I became to feel like human garbage again. It was time, when I found informations about NoFap and YourBrainOnPorn. But, as you see, not much had changed from that time. 
 Now, when the backstory is over, it's time for the most fucked up part of my problem. Approximately a year ago I started to fantasize about autofellatio. I was wondering, if I am physically able to do it. I've even had wet dreams in which I was sucking my own dick. And I tried to do it a couple of times. But it get worse, when I started to masturbate to cum on my own face and in my own mouth. I am 100% straight, but when I don't fap for a while, a thought of trying autofellatio and self-facializing pops up right in my brain and it's there until I finally make it happen. 
 I'm sick of this crap. I promise to all of you, that I will not do this kind of shit no matter what. I also promise, that I won't masturbate at all for at least 100 days. I will keep you posted. 
 Does anyone have (or had) a similar problem?","23 y.o. straight guy keeps fapping on his own face, seeks help, tips, motivation and so on.

"Mine requires a little back story.  I had just earned my MBA and was having lunch with a family friend that happens to be our broker.  My parents had known him for 25 years or so.  I'm sitting at the table explaining to him that I've sent out hundreds of resumes and not heard a single call, I'm running out of money, I don't know how I'm going to pay my rent.  I explain that I really thought the second I had that degree in my hands, the offers would come in.  The entire time he's sitting there smiling, nearly starting to laugh.  Finally, I ask him what's so funny.  He reaches into his wallet and pulls out the oldest business card I've ever seen and hands it to me.  It is dirty, worn on the edges, and simply has the words, ""Welcome to the zoo"" printed on it.  When this broker was fresh out of college, he got a job at the local brokerage and was trying to earn my father as a client.  My father at the time was the president of this company in Alexandria and the broker really wanted to earn his business.  He'd call him over and over and my father would simply turn him away.  Finally one day, he calls and it saying to my father that he went to school, got his degree, got a great job with a respected brokerage and can't earn a single person's business.  He said that if only someone would give him a chance, he'd show that he was qualified.  My dad told him to come to his office and talk to him.  My father gave him a check that day, and the card that says ""Welcome to the zoo.""  My father explained to him that it's incredibly hard to get started and that you just have to persevere--it's a zoo out there.  He also told him to hang onto the card.  He said, ""One day you're going to make it and I guarantee you someone will be saying to you what you're saying to me.  Pass along the card."" 
 That day came.  Here I was in much the same situation.  He handed me the card and said, ""Never did I think I'd be giving it to that guy's son but your time has come and so has mine."" 
 I've carried it in my wallet now for 10 years and I'm dying to be able to one day pass it on to the next person.  To this day, I don't let my wallet anywhere out of my site, all because that card is in there. 
 Unfortunately, my dad has Alzheimers and doesn't remember giving the card out.  I wish I knew why he had it in the first place, or how long he had it before he gave it to our broker.  The card has to be about 35 years old now and I probably won't be able to give it away for another 20...  but that's my most sentimental item, without a doubt.","A business card that's quite old with the words ""Welcome to the zoo"" printed on it.",35,M,AskReddit

"I'm not sure if seddit is the best place for this, but I lurked and I feel I have taken a lot from the PUA/seduction/self improvement community. So I wanted to give my story back in the hope that someone reading this will feel motivated to get off their ass and do something! (Sorry it turned out to be a bit long) 
 I am a very quiet person around new people and constantly the nice guy around girls. In fact all of the girls I know are friends of friends and I don't know any of them well enough to just hang out. I am 26 and in those years I have had sex twice, yup that's it seddit, twice. Both times with the same girl at collage. I have never been in a relationship that has lasted longer than 2 months. I spent most of my collage life doing drugs and studying, I was always under the impression that having a girlfriend is something that just eventually happens. Every year that has gone by I keep saying to myself, ""This is it! This is the year I meet my dream girl."" And so the year goes by without anything happening, then next year I'd say the same thing, shit all happened... Last year something did happen, I met her, the perfect girl. Problem was I had no fucking idea how to attract her and I thought of myself as a huge looser that doesn't stand a chance. It was then that I realised, I'm fucked! It had now been 4 years since I'd had sex and developed a severe case of AA and oneitus with this perfect girl. 
 I started digging up stuff on the Internet. I read various books, articles and watched many videos. But I found that it was very difficult for me to actually apply the stuff, it just didn't feel like it was ""me."" I did learn a lot about body language, eye contact and flirting however. At the time I had very little self-esteem and my friends are not very supportive. An example of that is at a house party I asked a friend to be a wing man, we walked up to a group of girls, I stopped and said hello, my friend turned around and left me there, then laughed at me when I eventually failed and got back to our group. I'm now starting to feel that my friends keep me around to feel better about themselves or use me for my computer knowledge. I'm also the butt of most of their jokes. 
 So I went about working to improve my quality of life. I made a list of all my insecurities and things I want to improve about myself, no matter how small. I then tackled them one by one. I did not move onto the next item until I had found a way to fix the current one, or in some cases until I feel 100% comfortable with it (I'm 5'5, some shit you just cant change). 
 A year on and I can now say: I go to the gym 5 days a week and now in very good shape; I eat a healthy diet; after years of suffering I've finally got rid of my acne; after a 20 a day habit I have quit smoking; I now style my hair; I've changed my style of clothes; I'm generally better groomed; I actually have hobbies and interests besides sitting in front of a computer; I have even stopped watching porn! But most importantly for once in my life I am happy that I can now say I'm actually an attractive guy and women want me. When girls walk by in the street they smile and once a girl even said hello! Seddit. I know this is small, but this kind of shit has never happened to me!! 
 During this ""self improvement"" time I kept reading PUA material and applying it in everyday situations (not so much on actually picking up women). I have a hectic schedule and a 9-5 job so it's difficult to go out and pick up. Also I'm doing all of this on my own without the support of my so called friends. So progress has been difficult and very slow. I have had a few successes but no #/k/f-closes yet. 
 I know a lot of people here say ""looks dont matter,"" ""just start approaching"" and so on. Well coming from where I have I can say that self improvement does some amazing shit to your whole demeanor and how you hold yourself. It is defiantly worth working on. I have been at this for a year and now I think I'm ready to actually start getting in the Game. I feel more confidant than I have ever been, in far better shape than I have ever been in and have a better mind set than when I started. Looking back I actually think I was probably depressed all those years and didn't know it. 
 There are still things I need to work on (profanity being one of them) but I feel going into this next year I can say ""THIS IS FUCKING IT!! I am bringing ME to the table, ladies come and have your fill!""","Never had a LTR, very sexually inexperienced and with many insecurities. 1 year on with a lot of help from reading PUA/seduction/self improvement books and posts I am now in a far better state then I have ever been.",26,M,seduction
"Now I must begin by apologizing if this is not the correct subreddit, but I need to ask a question.  I was just currently detained by the Denton Police Department (Texas) for over an hour.  I will begin with some back story: 
 I was at a friends place at the apartment complex at which this took place, the shindig we were having died down to three people so we decided to take ourselves elsewhere.  My friend had been invited to another party at the complex and we tagged along.  I got there and drank another beer (I was not intoxicated I had only had three beers throughout the night, and I am 21).  Not too long afterward the police showed up.  I told people at the party to do two things: be calm and be quiet.  The police knocked on the door for a few minutes, maybe three, and then all was quite.  During this time they harassed my other friend who was outside to pick me up.  I was inside and insisted that the owner of the apartment were to open the door.  But they did not listen.  Finally my friend who was there to pick me up called and said that the police had left.  I took his word and walked out the door. 
 Upon meeting with him in the parking lot two police officers ran up from different locations around the corner.  They could not tell where I came from from their locations.  They asked to see our IDs, regardless of the fact that there is no stop and identify law in the state of Texas, I produced my identification (I, too my knowledge had not committed any crime).  The police officer then went on to list off roughly 12 offenses that he said I had committed including noise violation from the party they were trying to bust, public intoxication, assaulting a tow truck driver and some more jargon that he bullshitted.  I said that I was not involved in any of the crimes that he listed off and his only response was ""we take what we can get."" 
 I was told that I must follow him to the door of the party that he had no idea whether or not I was at.  I asked him if I was legally obligated to do so and he said that I was.  I asked what would happen if I declined, and he said that he would charge me with all 12 offenses and take me to jail.  I'm not stupid, even though I knew I was being intentionally manipulated and misled I followed.  We then stood outside of the door for nearly an hour before anyone answered. 
 In the time I asked him whether or not I was being detained, one of the police officers said that I was.  I asked him why, again.  He did not answer.  I asked for the badge numbers of him and his comrade, they ignored me multiple times.  I stood, and I waited.  Then I asked why they were so adamant about busting a small college party and didn't care about catching the guy who assaulted me in the middle of the street.  Their only reply was ""tough fucking luck."" 
 I'm currently quite infuriated that I was held on false pretenses and the fact that they knew that they were holding me on such false pretenses.  Being at the party and seeing the tow truck pull up, I knew that no one threw a bottle at him.  I was on the balcony the entire time.  It was a noise violation and nothing more. 
 I don't entirely know what I can do.  I don't believe I have standing to sue, and I'm pretty sure if I were to report this to the police chief or file some complaint it would be laughed at.  But this isn't fucking right.

 Like a lot of former American Football offensive lineman I had to be large. And like many former American Football offensive lineman I was doing a terrible job at keeping the promise to myself that I'd lose my playing weight after my ""career"" was over. 
 Armed with a new job, a recent breakup, and a solid month of poor financial decisions I decided to focus on my health. I knew how to lift. I knew how to work hard. But, working out to lose weight, and eating to lose weight I was never particularly good at. 
 The Plan: 
 I researched a number of the training programs on bodybuilding.com, different diets, and decided I'd follow Krist Gethin's 12-week trainer pretty close to the T, and see what I could do. I started December 3rd, 2012 and after a month was down about 15lbs. Then another month, and I was down another 15lbs. Six meals a day, fist sized portions of any lean meat, complex carb, and vegetables was working. I was taking your standard pre-workout supplement (whatever was on sale), and Cellulor HD on top of CLA, my multi, and protein shakes. 
 The Hernia 
 Then I signed up for one of those transformation contests and got a little overzealous with my training. At some point in early February my groin started bother me, I ignored it. Pushed through it. Then one morning I couldn't even sit in the car long enough to get to work. 
 Hernia. 
 It was a minor inguinal hernia. Surgery was set for March 19th. I maintained my diet, and light cardio up until the operation (maybe some lifting too...) and weighed in at 253 at the hospital before my surgery. 
 Post Operation 
 Recovery was four weeks. I started doing light cardio after two, and re-started the Gethin trainer after four. Once I hit about 240lbs I began weighing out my portions and tracking my calorie intake and macros using the Lose It! app. I stuck to about 1 gram of protein per lb of body weight, same with carbs, and .5g fats, trying to hit a 40/40/20 split. I completed the Gethin trainer at the end of June and took a week off before starting a lean bulk (less cardio, slightly higher calorie/protein intake). 
 I'm insanely happy with my results. Not only from a fitness standpoint, but for a lifestyle perspective as well. Having the opportunity to literally rebuild a wardrobe ( is A. expensive B. Fucking awesome. 
 It's late. There's a lot more I feel like I should include (balancing work and meals/social life/I still suck at this sleeping thing). But, I just thought I'd like the share some of my story. Oh, and hopefully ride this karma train into the fiery pits of Reddit hell.","Finally made good on the promise to myself to lose my playing weight through diet, exercise and discipline.

"Sorry if this is awfully formatted. I'm on mobile with a throwaway because I don't remember my mains password and my bf knows the username) 
 Jake (19m) and I (21f)have been together for 6 months but we have been best friends for almost two years. He uses Facebook religiously. There's actually a few things I'm upset with on his page but the main thing is ex-girlfriends. 
 I never asked him to untag or delete any photos of him with other girls. I realize he had a life before me and his memories are important. He did delete all the profile pictures he had with other girls, which I greatly appreciate. 
 But, he had a lot of short relationships in high school and they're all listed on his Life Event section. It's kind of ridiculous. 2014 ""Jake is in a relationship with Cara."" ""Jake is in a relationship with Melissa"" ""Jake is in a relationship with Kasey."" 2015 ""Jake is in a relationship with Megan"" ""Jake is in a relationship with (me)."" He's not even friends with all of them so it just says ""Jake is in a relationship"" like 6 times. 
 It's really bothersome to me because it looks like that I'm just the next one on his list. I'm his longest relationship and we are planning our future. We're trying to move in together soon and talking about marriage (as in, we're going to get married one day when we're out of school/employed etc). I take this relationship very seriously. 
 Also, he slept with most of them, but he was my first. I just keep thinking about him being intimate with them. I keep looking at their profiles and comparing myself to them.

"Every homecoming game people streaked at halftime, seniors did. But my senior year the school admin. loaded up on the cops, dogs, and all things to prevent this from happening. We decided to streak anyways. As I was leaving that night my mom had specifically said ""dont get caught streaking"". I had a mask as well (WWE Superstar the Rock) to cover my face because the school recorded it to bust kids later. A lot was on the line, ISS, OSS, basketball suspension, indecent exposure charges. Still not deterred from this. Half time rolled around and we approached the field through the woods, essentially undetected. We bursted on the field, instantly multiple cops were on are tails. I was able to lay down in the middle of the field in my WWE Rock mask, thinking I was bad ass. It was a huge rush, but not worth the aftermath. Anyways we all successfully made it on and off the field. I struggled climbing the chain link fence as I previously had gotten a severe puncture wound in gym class two days earlier. Anyways, somehow I made it to my car safely and was attempting to get out of there, while the cops were speeding around the neighborhoods trying to find us. It wasn't finished yet, I was about to leave the general area of my HS when I had gotten a text that a fellow streaker went down and had broken his leg or ankle and was in the woods hiding. I went back to try and save him in my car, when I pass a stop sign and am suddenly pulled over for ""running a stop sign"". I could not deny that I was streaking as I was still in my boxers and had the mask in the back seat. The cop proceeded to make me step outside the car in my boxers in october on the main street by our high school as many many families and friends were leaving the game. Game over, indeed. Went home and said ""Mom....got caught streaking"". The next day I was called down to the office was suspended 4 days ISS in an alternate learning center where I was picked up by a short bus (Ironically I did more school work in this 4 day period than I did in all of senior year), two weeks suspension from basketball however I did not receive any legal charges because I was still a minor. It was fun and was glad I did it, I don't think that opportunity presents itself too often.","Streaked at HS homecoming game, got caught.",18,M,AskReddit
"A little background. I'm a 22-year-old white American male, and she's a 25-year-old Chinese girl. I met her last year, and we'd met up several times for coffee and whatnot, but I didn't ask her out until last month. 
 That our relationship only lasted a month is indicative of how totally different the two of us are. I like her, but the moment we started dating, her expectations went through the roof. She's really passive-aggressive too, so she would get upset about something (more often than not leaving me confused about why she was so upset) and all but insist that I had to cheer her up, and when I was left either constantly repeating ""sorry"" or telling her I wasn't sure what I did wrong, she would call me stupid. She barely qualifies as fluent in English, expected me to know exactly why she was mad when she was mad, and was really sensitive and took any potential slight from me as a reason to get upset again. Needless to say, no matter how hard I tried to calm her down, she would always be upset again a couple days later, for things that I personally see as not a big deal (e.g. browsing reddit when she's in the bathroom, using the word ""annoying"", etc.).","just broke up with my gf who turned out to be too sensitive for me to handle. 
 I guess what I learned from the whole thing is that I don't want to dive head-first into a committed relationship. I dated my first girlfriend long-distance for 1.5 years, so I thought that what I wanted was just another steady relationship, but all I really want right now is someone I can talk to, hang out and mess around with. 
 Ideally, I'd like to start getting into some more casual dating, online or elsewhere (I live in Chicago).

"My girlfriend [F18] and I [M18] have been together for 3 months now after 7 months of knowing her. It is my first serious relationship and I'm completely new at this. I have learnt a lot of things with her, from how to kiss a girl to actually how to act as a boyfriend, a completely new experience. I have discovered that I'm an extremely jealous guy, it worries me a lot because I'm the type of person whose mind can destroy him horribly. I am quite sure that you know what I'm referring to, you start imagining situations, events that have not happened but your mind says that the possibility exists and that they might happen even if rationally it is completely impossible. 
 My girlfriend has a lot male friends, some of them older than her. Personally I don't have any problem with that, and I think it's awesome. Particularly there's one 'friend' that manages to drive me crazy, let's call him Erick. He's 22 years old and goes to college (my girlfriend and I are both in senior year of high school, almost graduating). Some time before I met my girlfriend, Erick and she dated for some time but never reached an actual relationship. The last time they saw each was about a year ago. They have been in contact since then and he has been insisting that he wants to see her. 
 She always shows me fragments of the conversations she sometimes has with him via Facebook or Whatsapp. He's always complimenting her and insists he is in love with her, along with the constant request of one day going out just for fun. I talked to her about how that guy makes me uncomfortable and well, makes me jealous. We talked and concluded that we would't talk about him anymore, implicitly referring that she would still talk to him but she would not talk to me about him or show me more fragments of her conversations. I think that's even worse. 
 This talk happened yesterday after she told me he was helping her to study Administration via IM. Today she went with her family to Monterrey for a week and returns on Sunday. She told me that on the Tuesday after her return, she will hang out with him just for fun after a year of not seeing each other. I don't know how to react or what to do. I don't know if I should feel jealous, if I should be calmed or what. Personally I think it is not a good idea to hang out with someone if you know for sure that that person has crush on you and that you are in a relationship with someone else. We both trust each others life and I love her immensely, she tells me not to worry a bit, to be calmed. I recognize that I screwed up in the talk part and other things, but still I think something it is not quite right here. Please help guys, honest and objective advices or comments. Thanks for your time.","Girlfriend will go out with former 'friend' who's in love with her. Don't know what to do, act or react.

"I've been dating my current girlfriend since she finished high school 2 years ago. We moved in about 3 months ago and she realized I spend a lot of time at home. Like, all of my time pretty much. I don't really go out unless we're going to a movie or a restaurant, or to get groceries. This is how I've lived my life since I sold my company when I was 19. I didn't make multiple millions of dollars or anything, but enough to live what I consider to be a comfortable life without having to work. 
 Anyway, I had previously mentioned to her that I don't have to work for a living anymore and I think she just kind of brushed it off, but after we started living together, I could tell it was bothering her. I do more than my share of the chores around the house honestly, considering I don't charge her rent or anything, but she still seems jealous of all my free time. She's been on my case to get a job for a while now and ""do something"". 
 The thing is, she works a $12/hr retail job, and I understand it's making her miserable. I told her if she hates her job so much she should quit instead of trying to make me just as miserable as she is. She was fuming after that. I asked her why she bothers working when she doesn't need to pay any bills and she basically said she didn't want a gap in her employment history in case she changed her mind and besides it was the ""right thing to do"". 
 She's a nice girl but lately she has been acting very passive aggressive about my lack of a job/hobbies. (The thing is, I do have hobbies but I guess since I do them inside the house they don't count or something). For instance, once I made stew as a surprise, and when she got home I mentioned I could smell it cooking all day, and she said something like ""Must be nice to sit here all day."" I can't even talk about a book that I've finished reading without her getting passive aggressive. 
 I tried to discuss things with her civilly and she expressed that she felt I was wasting my life. (I'm pretty sure she's the one wasting her life slaving away at a job she hates, but OK). I said I worked hard in high school to learn the skills I needed to build up my company from nothing, and when I sold it, I was cashing in on all of that hard work. Now I'm free to do whatever I want and live off the money I made. She said that was stupid and ended the conversation there. 
 This is really driving a wedge between us. I'm not thinking too far into the future or anything, but I assumed we had a decent shot of getting married since we got along really well. It wasn't until she moved in that she's started to have problems with my lifestyle. I am absolutely not going to give up my free time to work for something I don't care about.","Made a decent chunk of money when I was 19, been living off of it since.

"I, F(23), have been involved in some weird situation with my roommate  , M(24). Without giving too many details, we have been hooking up/unofficially seeing each other (in the sense we have never had any discussion that we are ""seeing"" each other per se, it is just kind of assumed that we will spend our drunken nights together) since the earlier part of the school year. We both got out of relationships around that time, and clearly both needed time to mend ourselves and not jump into anything serious at that point. As well, he was EXTREMELY adamant he would not want to date someone who he was living with, and that we could see where our feelings lie near the end of the school year when we moved out. 
 To summarize about six months worth of events, there were definitely some ups and downs in this period of time, and I wasn't really sure if things would work out for us come move out time. We did have discussions about our mutual liking for one another, and that we didn't really want to see other people as to screw up what we had building, and he appeared to be pretty faithful to me. When we go out drinking, he never strays or flirts with other girls, he is always by my side and pretty affectionate and what not. I would say I trust he likes me quite a bit, I could be wrong, but considering he isn't the most emotional person, he seems to have extended himself quite a bit. 
 Anyways, here is my situation. So we are moving out in a week, so the excuse of ""but we're roommates..."" will not longer apply. I like him a lot (not obsessively, mind you, but enough that I would be willing to try and see if things would work in a more official, bf/gf sense).

"I'm in in my late 20s and started seeing a girl (also late 20s) in April. We only dated for about 6 weeks (I know, but we went on about 20 dates in that time), and then I had to leave for a summer job. I've been away for about 1 month, and have a little under 2 months left. 
 We agreed that we wouldn't be ""dating"" long distance (not be exclusive), but decided to keep in touch through Skype and texts. The plan is that, assuming we're both single in the fall, we'll start again then. 
 It started off ok (lots of texting and skyping), and then I was supposed to visit last weekend for a night (I was in the area for family stuff). But, out of the blue she canceled (the day before), saying that she got anxious not seeing the person that she's ""seeing."" We had a long talk, and I asked her what she wanted to do, and she said that she'd like to keep texting and skyping, and then try again in the fall (when I'm back). I asked her what the chances she thinks she'll be single when I get back are, and she said ""Honestly I don't know. Probably pretty good."" 
 So I told her I'd back off a bit, and let her set the pace for contact. She texted me a couple days later, and we've been exchanging a couple texts a day. 
 Anyway, I'm just feeling really stressed here. I really like this girl, and want it to work out. But I'm also constantly wondering whether some other guy will come and sweep her off her feet before I get back. Honestly, I might feel better if we just broke it off, but I don't want to jeopardize getting back together with her in the fall.

"I honestly don't know what to call this, but alt title:  Love is a difficult video game ) 
 So I've never been the popular type, never had many friends or anything. Before starting at uni, I had a free year where I worked to earn some money, while also improving my social anxiety and appearance. I think I did pretty well - I can talk to most people without issues now (can't flirt though), and I dress in clothes that makes me seem outgoing. I'm handsome by any means, but I'm okay I think... 
 Starting at uni, I see the girl in my class who I really want to get to know better. I try to get out of my comfort zone and catch her eye a few times. The first 5 days of uni is a intro course, and on the last day, there's dinner with party afterwards. Who am I being seated next to her? HER! yes! We start to talk and get along pretty well (We study the same thing). We start talking afterwards (exchanging phone numbers, facebook, steam, etc.). 
 We're pretty similar in a sense.. let me explain: She basicly is where I was before I started improving myself. A lot of little details tell me this. This means she's shy - very shy. But we've had a lot of personal talks, and one night I gave her a pretty well timed kiss on the chin - which is pretty ground breaking for me. We talked about trying her&I out, seeing if it would work. I didn't want to push too hard, because I know this is probably overwhelming seeing her background of equal unpopularness. 
 Getting to know her has been a challenge though. She's a very pretty girl I think - and so do others. With a few parties we've attended, a couple of guys have come to hit on her. I started seeing them as.. like, bosses I needed to defeat (gaming-gene, couldn't help it). First guy was pretty easy, as he never really did anything (but I overheard him talking to another friend about her - which was when I realized I needed to move fast). Second guy was way more attractive than me, but he defeated himself by trying to pronounce her name. Third guy was a tough one though. He was pretty handsome (less than the second), and he was fun. Really cool guy. He had his arm around her several times that night, while I had to sit and watch. I defeated him by continuously talking to her after that party - showing her that I want to give her attention. 
 Within this month and a half, this ""relationship"" has been going up and down. I've really tried to give her signs that I really care about her, but I don't she knows how to - or don't WANT to! When I sit next to her in class, I lean up against her, touch her arm, etc. But she just sits there - doing nothing! I feel I take the most initiative... I've tried to have an honest talk about whether she likes it, or even if she wanna keep going. She says yes - in a weird, unsure way, while replaying that she's really bad a this stuff. 
 starting last week, I've noticed she started hanging out with another friend from our social-circle. This guy is an okay friend (we're not super close friends, but we get along pretty great), but... 
 I don't fucking know what this guy has that I don't... or if it's her. Jesus fucking Christ, what am I doing wrong (if I am doing something wrong..). He's like a final boss, but he's not too handsome, funny or fit as the others. 
 I don't want to sound entitled, but I'm the sole reason for that there even is this goddamn social circle. I Brought in her, I brought in him, I brought in other outcasts of other groups - too awkward to maintain any long lasting friendship, but through continuous communication, I've established a pretty good friendship between us. I've done and fought so fucking much, and this guy is pretty much stealing in front of my eyes. What the actual fuck dude. 
 I don't know. I'm also expecting she's just too shy to say no to anything, you know? Whether it'd be me or him asking. But they seem to be getting along so well... :'/ I was pretty sure she's was gonna be my first girlfriend. But perhaps not. Tomorrow, friday, I'm planning on doing a personal 4-eye talk with her again. I've had the feeling that I might be annoying her, so I don't even dare writing her, and she still doesn't give any hints towards me. Fuck I'm sad. Fuck I'm lonely.

 Hi r/atheism 
 Before i ramble on with my somewhat incoherent story here is some background information (this is important to the context): i'm a danish guy, 6ft 3inch, white, skinny, blonde, blue eyes etc. you get the pic. 
 I was an exchange student in Santa Ana, California, a city below Los Angeles, from August 2010 untill june 2011.
Santa Ana is predominately latino, and the school i went to (Santa Ana Valley high. Shout out to my peeps) is 95% Latino. the latter 5% being a mix of black,white, asian and so forth.
Since the school was mostly latino it was also, naturally, mostly catholic/christian. 
 I noticed difference in emphasis on ""race"" and religious beliefs from Denmark to the U.S.
I noticed that people openly tried to convert me regardless if the only other word the've said to me was ""hi""
No shit. I was introduced to a guy by these words ""Hey Andy. This is Chris(me) he is from Denmark.""
""hi there. herp a derp derp. have you heard of Jesus Christ"" (side note. Denmark has a Christian church of state although no ones believes that shit anymore) 
 Even at restaurants people wouldn't stop giving me shit. A waiter that barely spoke english tried to convert me after my host family told him we just came from church and i went although i am an atheist.
Now obviously at the ripe age of 16 i was not gonna tell him to shut the fuck up and just bring me my fucking food. 
 i got straight A's all year in all subjects, and my psychology teacher told me i was one of the brightest students he has ever had. My host moms first question after i told her this was ""is he white?"" ""yeah...why?""  ""ah...that's why.."" 
 At new years my host brother was asked about his new years resolution and he answered this, word for word ""i am going to talk more about God, because some of my friends are catholic, and i want to help them see the error of their ways"" ....what. the. fuck.","so much shit... 
 Hopefully y'all had time to read this and won't hunt me down and shove spears up my butt.

"First post on here so not entirely sure how smoothly this will go. 
 I (20 F) have been in my current relationship for nearly 6 years with (21 M). We met when we were both quite young in different schools (just over an hour from one another) due to some music event which brought together all the schools in the county or ""state"". When he was about to go into sixth form (not sure what the american equiv is?) he moved to my school and his mum moved to my hometown so we were much closer, he considered it as him moving schools for me.
We're each other's first real girlfriend/boyfriend, though we did have a break about 3 years into our relationship of over a year (which we both regretted - me straight away as I did the ""dumping"" but eventually after he kept rejecting me - apparently a ploy to salvage his dignity, I started to get my head around us not being together again, then a few months later he voiced how he still had feelings for me and it sparked the feelings back for me) during which we both had some involvement with other people. 
 We've been back together now for nearly 2 years and we've definitely had our ups and downs, however we had a big realisation that we needed to fix the more problematic downs at the beginning of this year and talked about our bigger problems and managed to somewhat resolve them and have then been much happier. Although recently, I've felt that the relationship isn't very 'fair', he doesn't feel comfortable when most males are friendly towards me but he is more than friendly with a female we met recently (the female is a new girlfriend of one of my boyfriend's closer friends) but I don't see how that justifies that it's 'okay' if they're really close, hugging and dancing together without me but infront of me when I'm pretty sure he would flip out if it was the other way around. 
 I met someone from his old school a few months ago (I only ever really see this guy in the presence of my boyfriend) and because this guy is really friendly with me, as he is with my boyfriend BUT apparently they didn't used to get on when they were in school together, my boyfriend isn't great when I'm just friendly with this guy and he's friendly back.
Another thing is that he recently gave his number to this girl who's about 17 who I walked in on him 'facebook stalking' her profile pictures even though he's not friends with her on facebook. He said she just invited him to a free party and I had nothing to worry about but I just didn't feel very comfortable with it. I guess those are the few things that have been making me feel a bit sceptical about the relationship recently. 
 This has quite literally been in the last week, so although I'm feeling shitty right now, I can just about muster out that generally, we're really good. I feel really happy around this guy generally. I'm not sure what to do, I can't say that I'm really happy right now, and I feel a mixture of feelings, like surely I can find someone who treats me maybe 'better'? but at the same time though I know it sounds silly, when we weren't together for over a year, I found time after time that other guys weren't making me feel like he does, which I guess is why I allowed myself to feel something for him again when he said that he still had feelings for me. 
I wasn't constantly trying to compare guys to him, but what I feel for this guy seems to be different from anything else I can feel with other people. 
 I'm not even really toying with the idea of leaving him because of what a massive flop it turned out to be last time, I know I would probably regret it for ages if I did and cliché as it will definitely sound, I feel like I want to be with him for a very long time in my heart. But the misery is making my head hurt, and I don't know what to do. I don't want the quality of my life to be limited because I can't shine to welcoming new people in my life in case my boyfriend isn't comfortable with it, but I also don't want the quality of my life to be shit again for ages because I've left this guy and our hearts both take a battering...","Been with my boyfriend for nearly 6 years, generally happy, we have our ups and downs as all couples do but recent downs have made me wonder.

"I think I really ""saw"" myself for the first time this weekend. I've been avoiding shopping because I still have quite a bit of weight to lose but I'm in that awkward stage where my fat clothes are looking too big and dumpy but my old skinny clothes are still too small. So I decided to pick up a few inexpensive items at Target to hold me over until I lose the rest.

There was even a medium shirt that I could have gotten away with but it was much shorter than the Large and I opted for the longer version as it seemed more slimming. Boy did this put me on Cloud 9! I really was not expecting this because over the last 38 pounds I've lost my measurements really have not budged. However.... 
 After my great success at Target I decided to measure myself since I haven't done that in a couple of weeks. NSV #2!!! This one is a really big deal for me because while the scale has been slowly moving, the measurements have stayed the same. Taking that into consideration with my body dysmorphia, I guess I was having a hard time ""believing"" the weight loss, ya know? Neck is down 0.5 in, waist is down 2.5 in, thigh is down 0.5 in and my hips/fattest part of my stomach is down 1 in (this one is a really really big deal to me). The only thing that hadn't budged was my arms, dammit. But I'll take it! This was wonderful motivation to KCKO! 
 And my final NSV #3 was this morning. I looked in the mirror and while I'm still not pleased with what I see, I saw a smaller girl. I saw a body that I could work on. The base is there. There's a lot of fat sitting on top of it, but there's an athletic girl underneath all that. I could see it! This was the first glimmer of true hope I've felt in a long time (when it comes to my weight/body). 
 I wasn't going to quit, but I really needed this weekend of NSVs. My weight has been such a burden, such a challenge over the last 8-10 years. My PCOS has been a big part of that burden and anyone who has it knows how much of an emotional beating it can be. I'm so happy I found keto which really seems to fight the PCOS and it's symptoms. 
 And finally, thank you to all of you who post. I'm a lurker much of the time, but I'm still here, reading your posts and using them for my own motivation. Thank you!","Had a wonderful weekend of NSVs including smaller clothes, measurements and just recognizing that I'm actually getting smaller. Yay!",38,F,xxketo
"Well, honestly I'm pretty sure I have pinpointed my when my exact problem occurred. I was 14, beginning of summer and was in the hospital due to appendicitis, long story short..yeah this is a long story, a quick easy procedure turned into a 3 day stay in ICU. I apparently wasn't responding after the breathing tube was taken out, so I was re-intubated and shot up with narcan, and the rest is hazy and I can't go to into details. Wake up with the worst pain in my lungs trying to breath was like pins and needles throughout my chest. My O2 sat was 84 and dropping when I didn't take deep enough breaths. but the deep breaths caused severe pain in my lower lungs, like when you exert yourself, x10, coughing ensued and would hurt my new incision. Ask for morphine, mind you my mom is freaking out since she was a nurse and could see the lackluster attitude of the hospital staff. Immediately my mom throws a basin pan under my mouth and I puke a full pan of reddish, brown, rusty liquid. In flys the chest x-ray machine, I'm drifting in and out of consciousness, from either the morphine or seriously not getting enough oxygen. Wake up, in elevator maybe 10 nurses drs around. Next thing, and this chokes/tears me up thinking about this, but i wake up with all of my family around. I try to ask what is happening and my dad just tells me to sleep. 
 That summer I didn't even want to play with my friends just saying I just had surgery I can't move around, which looking back I can see my gradual decline. I changed. I used to be talkactive with everyone never cared what anyone though, but starting high-school now it seemed different. A month passes, and I experience my first panic attack. What hell it was, I froze in my seat, thinking my life was going to end. Didn't move or do anything thinking if I just sit here I'm fine don't exert yourself and your heart won't explode. So that goes on and off for months before I even bring it up with my parents. Get Rx and all that, the shit made me do crazy stuff, like stealing to even feel anything, blah blah. Went off paxil and yes I was a ""stoner"", but I decided to take LSD. This was very beneficial for me, small group of friends and I exploring all day, in a field , stream and watch the sunsetting. The next day no panic, next month no panic/ anxiety. I was free for two years. Meet a wonderful group of friends and was doing amazing, mind you still shy. But once I meet someone once, and everything was normal. Moved away to go to college and the panic started again, couldn't live without my friends so I moved back. When I moved back my problems were gone. 
 A marriage, and couple kids insert here 
 Now, a couple years later I'm feeling the worst anxiety, I tried college again, and doing good, wasn't quite ready for a semester, but I switched majors and it really helped my grades. 
But back to the anxiety, I was at work feel sick, anxiety attack coming, so I tell my boss I'm not feeling well and he lets me leave (student job) I hop on my bike and start riding, get up on hill could past the intersection and boom, I'm nearly knocked off my bike by the WORST chest pain, literally tunnel vision, almost blacking out. I jumped off my bike call my wife FREAKING out thinking I'm having a heart attack. I calm down a little enough to where I can coast my bike back home. Still freaking out, my wife is able to calm me down, and I simply pass out for two hours. This is what plaques me now, after this episode I've had many many more, but with just chest tightness, shortness of breath, pain radiating to my hand, fingers  and toes numbing. O yeah RACING heart like 180. So we drive to the hospital since I didn't want to pay for the ambulance fee. 
No heart enzymes checked, because they read the ekg and its fine. I've been to the hospital four times in a 5 month period. One of my last EKGs said septal infarction of indeterminate age which really freaked me out. But the nurses and Doctors said I'm too young to have a heart attack (22) and that because I was a vegan, that it was impossible. Which didn't help me at all. 
 So I schedule a follow up with Primary, he does the stress test and an echo. Which all come back fine. 
 But why do I still get a sense that something is wrong?
I still have the chest pains. Still have the anxiety and FEAR literally the most IRRATIONAL FEAR of having a heart attack. My psychiatrist order a cholesterol check because being me was to shy to ask any of the other docs. It is insanely low. 
HDL: 61 and my LDL: 27 
 But yet I still FEAR death. I've stopped running and biking because I simply think if I were to exert myself I would leave my wife and kids.  I used to run 8 miles in a day sometimes and I MISS IT. I miss biking, running, being able to run around with my kids. But now it's I don't want to move because it aggravates my chest tightness, burning , which makes me panic even more. 
 I'm in therapy, on a daily dose of xanax. But I've started to think I'm becoming depressed. I can't perform (bed), I just want to be alone which is taking its toll on my relationship. I don't think she understands that I love her, I'm just not able to show it. 
 I've been going to the chiropractor which he says my rib slips out of place. I have gone to my primary and he said same thing, but I asked him about my heart and just get brushed off with ""its not your heart"" 
 So I have another doctors appt at a large hospital, who will hopefully understand. I don't know it's a lot to tell him, but I'm going for the pain in my chest that's constant. Morning to night. 
 Hope everyone out there gets treatment and if you need someone to talk to PM me. I may get around to it, but reading others stories really helps me so I thought I'd share","Unhealthy, completely irrational fear of heart attacks. When everything else points to being healthy.",22,M,Anxiety
"Dear Reddit, 
 I am a 20yo girls who has little understanding in what is going on in America and the world. I do not have a TV to watch the news regularly, and if I did, I do not care to hear about the drama between what one pop celebrity did to another pop celebrity. I also am not interested in becoming depressed over dogs being skinned alive and mothers abusing their children. I do not understand political terms and I understand economic terms even less (talk to me like I'm 5!). Given these things, I hate that I don't know about London's protests, what is actually being done to legalize marijuana, and what the OWS are standing in for. So, Reddit, I ask you: how can I become involved with the most important things that are going on in the world without wasting my time and taking up 3hrs a day.
I leave my fate in your hands.

"Some quick background: I am 31 but have a huge 10 year gap in life experience due to illness. So while I am middle aged in terms of dating and relationship I feel like a teenager. 
 I started trying to break into the dating world on OKC where I met the woman I will call ""Jane"". She lives 200 miles away, but has been planning to move much closer to me. Because of the distance and an unexpected surgery (mine) we were never able to meet in person, although we got along very well doing all the typical LDR things (phone, text, skype). We would also send each other packages of things we found interesting that the other might like, and all in all everything seemed good. 
 However there were also things that stood out to me as potential warnings, like how she talked about her ex (gf thought she called her wife without having any ceremony). Or how she would talk about teams and things she was on and not getting along with anyone. She also uses a nickname for my I've expressed not liking as I feel that it doesn't fit me. 
 The nickname doesn't seem like a big deal, but I feel like she is more excited by the idea of me than the actual me. She had signed up for the Army and shortly before she went to boot camp she sent me an engraved item with ""Love Jane"" on it. We have never met IRL and I have explained to her that it's important for me to meet her and see if we have any chemistry in person (and also to be able to get a read on her body language and relationships with others since red flags are so easy to hide online). I directly told her she was moving way to fast, and while I had agreed not to date anyone else while she was in boot and had taken down my OKC profile we were not ""seriously dating"" . In other words she had caught my interest and I wanted to meet her in order to see if we had something worth pursuing. 
 Once she was in boot we exchanged letters, although she didn't get a lot of mine at first because she originally gave me the wrong address. She had decided to not use her phone privileges to call me until halfway through when she told me she was being kicked out ""for a joke"". We couldn't talk long, and the next day I got a letter that sort of explained more saying that she didn't get along with her battle buddy and the girl had turned her in for making a joke that ended up with her on suicide watch. The letter said the army pysch had diagnosed her as depressed and she could re enlist in 6 months if she got counseling. 
 She has refused to tell me what the joke was, and blames everything on the other girl and the other people in her platoon, saying that they are all assholes etc. When I talked to her a week later she mentioned that she had punched walls in anger on 5 different occasions, and damaged her hand. Also more about how much she hates the other people in boot, and how much it sucks that they won't let her play with guns or explosive ordinance. When I asked her if she was going to counseling she said she was just going to do the minimum to get back into the Armed Forces. Oh and the last letter I received she talks about how she has fallen in love with me . 
 Lastly, my recovery from surgery has taken a long time (spinal surgery) and one of the only ways I can exercise at the moment is walking (I can't twist my spine). I go on long hikes, and due to some phone issues I have been taking it with me but turning it off so my battery won't die. She was randomly getting phone privileges (I guess during times when the rest of the platoon were doing things with weapons she wasn't allowed) and calling repeatedly and texting during times when I couldn't answer. So the other night I turn my phone back on to a string of texts that go into things like ""you must be mad at me"" ""I guess all I have now is the army"" ""its true what they say you go in together and come out alone"" and this long gem: 
 ""At this point all I can do is just focus on fighting to stay in the army. Only thing I've got left at this point, I'm not going home any time soon. I'm done hoping. Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man mad. And it's tearing me apart. As they always say you may come in the army in a relationship but you will leave single. Trackin."" 
 My text back was pretty curt, just saying my phone had been off and wtf why is she all over the place and just basically that I hadn't been pissed at her but the last text did piss me off. No response until about an hour ago when her response is ""hay nickname_I_hate. whats up?"" 
 So /r/relationships my question is this, what is the best way to break things off? There are way to many red flags for me to ever be comfortable with this relationship, so i know that ending things is the way to go and will be best for both of us, but how? Should I right a letter, or wait for her to call? Or since she is supposed to get home in a week or so should I wait and do it then. Should I tell her some of the things that made me uncomfortable or should I just leave it at irreconcilable differences? And as for stuff she has sent me, like a shirt with special meaning to her, should I send it back?","Met chick online who got very clingy, she joined the army got clingier, got put in suicide watch and just in general sounds like an antisocial mess with anger issues. I need advice on breaking it to her that we are not going to work out and I am no longer interested in having a relationship with her (once we could meet IRL).

"The other day I got into a spat with my mom over homework. I'll spare you the details, but essentially I was upset because she was yelling and wouldn't listen to what I have to say. I then started to do my math homework, but she came back in to keep yelling. I told her to shut up and let me do my work, and she came over and punched me on the arm. I punched her on the arm back, but admittedly much harder. She has a bruise. Later, when I finished, I came out of my room to show her I finished, and we started arguing again. I was frustrated that she still was not listening to me, so I let out the F-bomb in exasperation. She got up and walked over to me, put her hands on me, and got in my face. I pushed her away. She started to punch my arm again, and I landed a right hook on her cheek. I ran into my room, and my mom called ""I don't want you to live here anymore!""  I cried for an hour and did not speak to anyone for the rest of the night. Next morning I went to the school guidance office (I'm a Sophmore) and told them what happened. They called DIFIS and a lady showed up yesterday and today. All the ""legal"" stuff is out of the way. But now my Mom is pissed and my sister (one year older than me) is really upset, pissed, and scared. Make no mistake, I know I'm in the wrong, but I don't know how to mend my relationship with my family. It's been strained for a while,  but I never hit her like this. I don't know what to do. 
For background, my parents have been divorced since I was in 5th grade. It was ugly. Last January my dad got a job in the Virgin Islands and moved. Now I stay with my mom full time. I never really liked it here, but I'm really starting to hate it. First I want to mend my relationship with my mom and sister, then address.  My comfort here.

"I am 25F and have fallen in love with a 24M paraplegic.  I am head over heels in love with this guy and think I'm going to spend the rest of my life with him and I want make love to him...except I don't know how. 
 We haven't really been physically intimate beyond hand holding and kissing because we live an hour away and don't get to see each other much. It's amazing, we have talked to each other about everything...except sex. We started sexting about a month ago and it got pretty hot and heavy...but last week he told me because of his paralysis he can't really have sex and I could tell it's killing him. I know that we should talk about it but I don't really know what to say...we are both virgins and he is my first serious boyfriend. 
 To make it worse last time we were together he left his laptop out and i found happened to see that he was researching ways to pleasure me and it just made me love him more but i have no idea how to return the gesture since he has no sensation below his abs.

 Do paraplegics feel sexual desire as strongly as regular people? (he doesn't really talk about sex much and it's kinda making me really insecure, especially cuz I am totally hot for him. It could be because he is insecure himself though, but he has always been private)

"17 year old in high school, been doing some research into confidence and seduction for a little while now and recently began using my new-found knowledge in the real world. Found a girl I like (let's call her A) and need help in getting her. This will probably be long so prepare yourself. 
 There are a few complicating factors in this predicament - 1. We both go to the same high school, 2. This girl recently finished a longish relationship (roughly 4 months) with a guy I know of, 3. She is a 9 and also super nice so it is hard to tell if she likes me back or not, 4. A lot of guys want her, 5. I'm close with her best friend who after I told her about my feelings warned me not to get my hopes up too much because she 'isn't looking for a relationship'. 
 Obviously after hearing these points there have to be some positives. Basically she is an amazing girl, and this isn't oneitis speaking, I swear. There is no single girl that compares with her personality in my year level for sheer kindness and relatability if that is a word - she is clearly popular for this but still is smart enough to not associate with the 'popular group'. 
 I have been talking to her for a little while, first we started talking at school where I was just interested in getting to know her decently. Then I built up the courage to message her on Facebook and it really just went from there. We talked for four nights straight about anything and everything - from deep conversations to flirting. I'll give you an example of what was said...
Me: I didn't realise how intelligent you are A, this just gets better ;)
Her: Haha same! I'm full of surprises ;)
Me: Haha it's just unfair when people are blessed with looks and intellignece ;)
Her: Where's my blessing? Give me some of yours ;) 
 Obviously after messages like these after a while we both got more comfortable and I made some big mistakes - like showing how much I cared. I won't go into too much detail because it isn't that relevant besides revealing some of my lack of confidence which was a stupid move. 
 Anyways, because she is way too nice to ever friendzone anyone in the normal way I feel like because she isn't messaging me first and it's down to me making the moves she isn't that interested. Because of the 5 points mentioned above, I'm not exactly sure how I should approach this situation. It's been a few days since I last spoke with her at school or on Facebook and I could either give it more time or just start messaging her again which could drive her further away. 
 Whatever happens I'm obviously not going to make the same mistake twice in showing desperation, I will play it cool either way. Any advice would be much appreciated.","please read! If not, flirted with a girl, then got mixed signals, not sure what to do now.",17,M,askseddit
"I'm fairly new to this whole Reddit thing but having read a few stories from others in this subreddit, I feel y'all might be the ones to talk to. Please excuse the incoming rant. 
 I'm not going to start this off with ""I've always known I was trans"" but I was constantly teased about painting my nails or hanging out with mostly girls or crying about absolutely everything. So about the age of 8, I decided to hide that part of me and become what everyone else said I should be. I got incredibly irritated with myself almost to the point of attacking myself every time I cried. I stopped painting my nails and putting the little stickers on them, I got a buzz cut which absolutely devastated me. I acted like everything was fine and eventually it was. I forgot I hated it. 
 And then middle school came along and something happened and all of a sudden I couldn't hide that I was depressed anymore. I stopped wearing the bright colors that said ""Look at me I'm over here!"" and started wearing a black t-shirt and blue jeans every single day. I stopped caring about myself at all. I became even more critical of myself, I saw every flaw in my body. Everything from my wrinkly knees to my already receding hairline and beyond. I stayed in this state from early middle school up through my first semester in college. When I learned of a thing called ""transgender"" Back in high school however, a friend brought up the idea of wearing dresses to the last day of school. I'm not quite sure how or why he came up with the idea, but I thought it was absolutely fantastic! I tried to keep my rough n tumble ""I am man hear me kill"" demeanor but I was clearly excited by the idea. So of course I thought I was a crossdresser. 
 I thought about it, I looked into it, I did my research. I knew it was more complicated than that, I didn't want to just wear girl clothes, I wanted to be seen as a girl. I didn't want people to keep calling me ""sir"". Or better yet, call me ""ma'am"" and then be quick to 'correct' themselves and call me ""sir"". 
 So, I dropped out of college in my first semester. I was scared shitless of the whole idea of transgenderism. But, I figured ""might as well jump and hope for the best"" which turns out was the best idea of my life.","I am currently living in Las Vegas as a woman, with my boyfriend and Master at nearly 4 weeks on HRT.

 always bought me food, spent time with me before and after, saw to my needs before his own, etc 
 as I said, he's never treated me as ""just"" a hookup

more time passed

 still have this odd arrangement 
 still somewhat unhappy bc I want more 
 him and his girlfriend broke it off. for good. completely. finished 
 go visit shortly after and hook up again 
 great as usual 
 
 Well, about a month later, I royally fuck up and go full crazy on him and call him and say that I love him but also can't talk to him ever again because I want an actual relationship. Terrible timing. He just broke up with his girlfriend. I was also in the middle of a mental breakdown at this time, totally unrelated to him, in my defense. Full blown insanity. Poor guy. 
 Five months later, I reconnect with him, thinking he sure as hell won't agree to be friends again after my nice little display. Surprisingly, he agrees to talk to me again and be friends as long as it won't make me upset like it did before. Interesting. 
 Now, I'm driving to see him sometime this month. I agreed to drive the hour and a half to visit him, rather than him visiting me. We're both busy, but I think he's a lot busier than I am. I have free time on weekends, whereas he has none, so I'm having to visit him during the middle of the week... So. I'm visiting under the pretenses of a hookup, as usual.

"I've been with about 10 girls, I'm still a young guy in his twenties, so maybe I don't have enough experience to make a broad generalization about girls, but I find it odd that not a single girl I've had sex with has complimented my penis or my body. 
 Almost every time I've fingered a girl, I say things like ""oh you're so wet"" or ""you're so tight"" or ""you have such a nice pussy"" to get my girl hornier and feeling good about herself. Yet not once have I received a ""you're so big"" or ""you have a such a nice cock."" The only time a girl has said anything about my dick was a long term girlfriend and it was after we had had sex twice and she was trying to get me hard again and when I finally did get hard she said ""omg you're so hard."" It was hot but why don't girls say these things more often? 
 Now, I don't have a monster cock, but it is bigger than average. I imagine some of the girls I've been with have had larger, but girls, just because it isn't the BIGGEST you've ever seen, doesn't mean you can't still compliment it. 
 I can only speak for myself and my friends that I've discussed this with, but listen girls, I would bet that if you tell your man he has a nice/big cock he will fuck you way better. It will make him feel alpha as fuck and he will totally get in the zone and crush your pussy. 
 Also, if a guy is trying to get hard and is a little nervous, it is extremely off-putting if a girl just looks at your limp penis with no enthusiasm. Limp or erect, you should act like it is the most amazing thing you've ever seen and want to worship it (regardless of the size!!!)","Sick of girls taking compliments but never giving them. I call your pussy tight and wet regardless of how loose and dry it is but you never call my dick big and hard. Saying something as simple as ""you have a nice cock"" can really go a long way for the ego. Please reciprocate compliments ladies. 
 EDIT:  Re-reading this post I sound really salty. The point was to open a discussion to see if I'm alone in this or if anyone else feels like women compliment men less than men compliment women.

"UPDATE 4: This isn't much of an update.  There's been very little contact between me and her.  It took A LOT of convincing on my part but she finally agreed to making an appointment and telling me when.  I still haven't seen her in person.  She's told me a day but hasn't confirmed the time or location.  Last I heard, she wants to go through with an abortion.  She tried to guilt me on the decision as if I was forcing it on her although I've only mentioned it as an option and have never ""forced"" it on her.  Right now, I figure there's 3 outcomes to this.  1) I go with her, the doctor says she's not pregnant and doesn't give her the abortion pill.  2) She doesn't contact me other than to say that it's been taken care of.  3) She actually is pregnant and decides to keep it at the last minute. 
 UPDATE 3: Still no word back from her (2:51 PM, 3 hours).  I'm insanely tired and am going to lie down for a little bit.  I'll check back later to see if there's any more comments.  If there's any big updates, I'll make a new post.  Thank you everyone for the advice and opinions.  I needed it. 
 **UPDATE 2: I added another transcript of our texts.  [They're still confusing.]( 
 **UPDATE: I added a small transcript of the most recent texts between me and her.  [You can read them here.]( 
 Quick backstory: I'm a 23 year old male that recently went through a very tough breakup.  I did what most men my age would do: I rebounded with the first attractive girl to show interest in me.  I guess the length of this ""relationship"" has been about 3 or 4 weeks. 
 Now I'm in the dilemma of having to deal with a pregnancy with a girl I don't have romantic feelings with.  To make matters worse, I'm not certain if I believe her.  I feel miserable about myself for thinking that but some of the things she's said and done do not add up. 
 She told me at about 4:30 AM, through a text message, that simply said ""I'm pregnant.  Call me.""  There's a few reasons why I'm uncertain about believing her.  Part of it is how she told me she found out and the other part is she said she's only been with me. 
 She says she found out because she was feeling sick yesterday so she went to the doctor and they ran blood work.  This, to me, seems strange that she was able to see a doctor so quickly and get a blood test done. 
 What makes me distrust her most is she has a boyfriend and hasn't been honest with me about it.  I found out on her Facebook that she was seeing a guy and calling him her boyfriend and he was calling her his girlfriend.  When I asked her who he was, she said that he was just a guy she's talking to and it wasn't anything serious.  This was actually the last time we talked before she told me she was pregnant. 
 The other odd thing is that I immediately talked to my older sister about it.  I am currently living with my sister and she's been nothing but supportive of me during the past few (rough) months.  FWB was pissed that I told my sister.  My sister also thinks the situation and her reactions are strange. 
 The advice I'm looking for is how to approach this subject.  If she really is pregnant, the last thing she needs is accusations of being dishonest about a pregnancy for attention.  At the same time, if she is being dishonest, this is the position she would want me in. 
 Right now I'm telling her I want to attend her next doctor's appointment.  As soon as I told her this, she said ""Ha.  What you think I'm lying?""  And now, it's been about an hour since she's texted me back and hasn't set a time for me to talk to her in person about it. 
 She has also said things like ""Oh, so now you care?"" to me, which just seems off. 
 Most of this has taken place within the past 3 hours and is a lot for me to process.  I'm trying very hard to be rational about my thoughts and I'm certain that I'm not thinking this solely because I do not want a child. 
 Thank you for the time it takes to read this.  I know it's not 100% coherent so if you need clarification, please don't hesitate to ask.","Girl I hooked up with is telling me she's pregnant.  I'm not 100% believing her. 
 Ninja edit: Something that might be important to add is that we've only hooked up 3 times.  Only two of those times we've had vaginal sex, both of which times I wore a condom.  The first time was early in August,  maybe even late July,  and the second time was on the 25th.  I'm not an expert on pregnancy tests but from my understanding it's not possible to find out within 4 days so she would have to be pregnant from the first time.",23,M,relationships
"I can't think of a better way to word this question, so perhaps it may sound silly. I'm in a bit of a rut and would like some advice from those who: 
 a) Have a career revolving around writing/performing music 
 b) Devote their free time aside from an unrelated career to music 
 c) Practice their instrument(s) of choice at an above average amount of time most days 
 I am a guitar player of about 10-ish years, I'm 24, and I would consider myself a ""musician at heart."" By that, I mean most of my daily thoughts revolve around writing, playing, and having a career based around music in some way. While my thoughts are devoted to this, my actions speak otherwise. 
 I spend a lot of time through the week travelling to and being at my job, which I am not too fond of, but it must be done. This leaves little time to do much after work. All in all, throughout the week I am lucky to get about an hour of practice in a day. I am wondering what you guys do for a living and how you got to where you are. 
 I feel like I'm way behind as to where I am ""supposed"" to be in how good I should be by now, but the motivation to catch up is severely lacking. Just the thought of practicing or writing gives me anxiety most days. 
 The recent loss of David Bowie has really made me think, how does any one human being, become like THAT? I mean, the complete and utter work horse that that man was.  How do you train your brain to just be in a constant state of acting and working towards building yourself as a musician?  I have tried finding other musicians to work with (even as simple as jamming and playing covers) to basically 'rewire' my brain to always be in this state. But mostly everyone I am acquainted with are already busy with their own bands/ musical endeavors/careers etc. And I don't know how to find more people. 
 I feel a lot of people might say my heart is probably not into it as I may think, but I believe otherwise.  I just don't know  where to start , and how to get where I am trying to get . I am in a constant state of panic because it truly is what I want to do, and I feel it's slipping away. I want to perform in bands, I want to play live. I'm not expecting to become a Bowie, but I want to be more involved in music as a whole. 
 I have other, mindless, hobbies that eat up practice time, and I am in the process of phasing them out. I want to take this, and myself seriously. I don't want to look back at myself when I am older, and be disappointed in myself for not being a better person. 
 Are most of the people that seem to have their lives revolving around music a cause of their environment? As is to say, are/were their parents musicians? Were you forced into it at a young age?  I know I wasn't. I am the only one in my family with any interest in playing instruments and performing, so my environment is completely unrelated to my actual interests.   How do I change this? 
 Maybe this is just a rant, or a bunch of questions, but any advice is appreciated.",How do I become like the David Bowie's and the Jeff Buckleys of the world? How do I become a work horse?  Where do I  start ?,24,M,WeAreTheMusicMakers
"I was working at Whirlpool in Findlay Ohio. At this factory, we make dish washers. Its the biggest factory of its kind in the world. 
 I was a line worker. A washing machine comes, I would put a part on it, it leaves and another one comes. Wash Rinse Repeat for 8 hours (or more if I signed up for overtime). The pay was great and the people I worked with were funny and helpful. 
 But after four years of this, I was getting depressed. Factory work, to me, is a soul crushing job (respect for those who can do it). I knew that this was a job that was quickly turning into a career, and it frightened me. This is not what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. Besides, what if something happens and I lose my job? I have nothing to fall back on.  I needed a change, but what? 
 Checking email on night, I was deleting some spam email when one caught my eye. It was from some on-line college, proclaiming I could be a ""dental hygienist"" or a ""law clerk"". Nothing really special. But one of the categories caught my eye. ""Computer Forensics"" 
 Now, I've always been a tech guy. Hell, I played my first NES when I was four and could beat everyone in my household in Super Mario Bros. (my uncle refused to play me because he hated looking like a chump to a four year old). I've always liked law enforcement too. I wanted to do both, but when I graduated high school in 2003, there was really no program like it. You would ether have to do it as a Masters program, or pick and choose your classes to build something along those lines. 
 But, on that day, my brain began racing. ""Computer Forensics? What is that?!"". I looked it up and instantly fell in love. It's the job I always wanted. But it was more then that, it was my unknown passion. I had to learn more, I HAD to do this. Doing a quick search in the area for colleges, I found Defiance College. I emailed them for more info and called my then fiance (now wife) and left her a voice mail about it. She later told me it was the happiest she has EVER heard me be and sounded like I was a child again. 
 I checked the school out, fell in love with the campus and instructors, and brought the fiance with me to register. It was there when I came upon a realization. If I did this, I would have to quit my job. The school was an hour away from where I worked, and there would be no way I could juggle both. She was making decent money also, but this would cut our income by half. 
 We talked about it for half an hour before I signed any paperwork. She said that this was a dream of mine for some time and we will make it work. She loved me and this would truly make me happy. 
 So, I quit my job, moved to Toledo (where my fiance lives), and enrolled. Four years later, I'm about to graduate with a bachelors in Digital Forensic Science, an associates in Criminal Justice, and a minor in Psychology. I'm now studying for the GCFA certification (a $1000 dollar certification) and the real world is about to call me back.

"So this is some pretty complicated stuff. Sorry for the wall of text. It's late. I'm tired. Sorry for editing errors. 
 A little background on me: I'm 21, male, college senior, also a virgin and I've never had a girlfriend but I have dated a couple of girls before. I'm just inexperienced. 
 Okay, onto the story: 
 I've known this girl, who we'll call Taylor, since last spring. We've become great friends within our little circle of friends that just kind of formed out of thin air. Taylor is one of those rare girls who is more of a bro than anything else. She loves cracking horribly inappropriate jokes about sex or periods or whatever. She acts like one of the guys, but if you get to know her, she let's out her girly side a lot. She's funny and sarcastic and she brings people together like nobody I have ever seen. We both have the same major at our college and we have a lot in common. 
 But she had a boyfriend. HAD. Let me explain his story. 
 They were in a long distance relationship and because of his job, they could only spend maybe two months out of the year together total. I've met him and I think he's a cool guy. But Taylor is physically needy. She's a self-proclaimed attention whore. So to combat her neediness, we became ""cuddle-buddies."" Basically, we just watch movies on the couch and spoon a bunch. Then, one time, she started masturbating. Just rubbing herself over her jeans. So we started jerking off together. Her boyfriend was cool with it. At the time, I didn't really have any feelings for her. 
 Here's the thing. Taylor and I talked a lot about this. I respected the boundaries, which she pushed just once. She wanted me to start feeling her up, which I declined because boundaries. This was big, apparently, and she said that she respected that denial. After, she explained to me that she felt really comfortable with me on an emotional and physical level. For me, this was a big deal. 
 Then, a couple of weeks later, she breaks up with her boyfriend. It was a long time coming, not related to me. She had expressed concern about their relationship for a long time, and she just decided to be mature and end it. They're still friends, though, which I think is great. 
 One night, Taylor brings a new guy who we'll call Jimmy into the group. He's the definitive ladies man. He's humble, but he's smart, tall, bearded, good looking, and has more one-night-stand stories than I can count. He's a cool guy, though, and I enjoyed his company into the group. 
 Taylor then tells me she's starting to have feelings for him and she's told him and he feels the same way. However, they are both working on some huge project and for now, they need to keep their relationship more professional. Kudos to them for being responsible, I say. Taylor has kept me updated on stuff between them, and it's escalating. 
 Then, Taylor asks for my help on a project. She needed help with a HUGE project that fit my are of expertise, so she asked me for help. She came over at 7pm and stayed until 5am. That time, we worked on the project but also talked about us. This is when I started to develop feelings for her. Deep feelings. 
 If I were to explain what she said to me, what she thought of me, you would be convinced that she was in love with me. I swear to God. She basically complimented me on a shit-load of stuff and it only made me fall harder for her. Later in the night, we started fooling around a bit. No kissing, just hand/masturbation stuff, but it got intense to the point where she wanted to cum together or have me cum on her stomach. I declined, not wanting to push boundaries even more. I told her after that I have feelings for her. She said that was okay and we'd talk later. 
 A few days later, she wanted to talk about the whole boundaries thing. Taylor doesn't regret anything, but she still thinks we pushed it a little far. I agreed with her, because I thought it escalated quickly and I try to be cautious of boundaries that were never reestablished once her boyfriend was out of the picture. 
 She mentioned Jimmy, too. She said she had a little thing the other night with him, stayed over at his place but no sex, and this hurt me a little. She told me there were a few red flags about him and a bunch of other stuff that seemed like something to be wary about. I don't know exactly what. But she sounded slightly unsure of what she was doing. 
 She told me we could still cuddle and stuff, and she said we'd work on our little relationship thingy, whatever the fuck it is. 
 So this is where I'm getting annoyed. It's not just that she's nice to me. It's not that she feels comfortable jerking off with me and letting me touch her tits and asking me if I wanted to cum on them. It's not that she sometimes looks at me and it feels like she's trying to stare into my soul. It's that I don't know WHY she doesn't have feelings for me. She's expressed that she doesn't, but not why. 
 When it's just the two of us, I feel like we make an amazing couple. This isn't just some guy saying, ""I asked my friend out and she said no, now I'm in the friendzone,"" it is literally, ""we fooled around a bunch and she feels comfortable with me, but doesn't have romantic feelings for me."" So you can imagine why it's frustrating. And I just don't know what to do. It goes a lot deeper than what's written here.","Have romantic feelings for a lady friend, but even after her admitting she's comfortable and flirty and physical with me, she doesn't have the same romantic feelings for me.",21,M,relationship_advice
"When I was 14, a small dog bit me in the face. I've come to understand that it was my fault, because I was leaning over it. Ever since then, I've just ignored dogs when around them and I haven't had any problems since. 
 Now, I've started seeing a woman who has a young dog, around 8 months old. She is  definitely  worth it and I can imagine a future with her, but I'm not sure if I can overcome my fear of her dog. He usually barks at me when I enter her apartment and when we're getting ready for taking him on a walk and that just freaks me out. Once it was so bad that my legs were shaking uncontrollably and even now thinking about it, while writing, my stomach feels like it has a pit in it and my legs feel weak.

"Jesus, this hit me hard. 
 My middle school years were... interesting to say the least. I have ADD, the inattentive kind. I also had quite the temper on me. The small, rural school I went to didn't know how to handle me in the least bit. If I got picked on, it was my fault. If someone shoved me around and I shoved back, it was my fault. If I got jumped after school and ended up beating the fuck out of the three assholes that did it, it was my fault. 
 I was always the one that got punished, no matter the reason. The kids that picked on me were always the same ones, and not once did they ever suffer any sort of disciplinary action. It escalated to the point that one of my friends stood up to the principal for me and got sent to juvenile detention for it. I got sent to an 'alternative' school where they sent the  real  troublemakers. The ones that were in gangs and stabbed people and shit. All I did was stand up for myself. 
 I was in this alternative school for most of middle school. I'd get out, and promptly get sent back again. I was the only one from my school there. I got so sick of it once, when we were out for P.E., I tried running away. I didn't know where to, I just ran. Cops quickly came and picked me up, and mom took me home from there. She'd get angry but it was never  at  me, it was because nobody knew what to do with me. 
 By the end of junior high, I had but one friend: the one that took the big hit for me. When she got back, she really didn't want much to do with me anymore. As the years went on, it was obvious that she was a changed person. I suppose we both were. 
 I got kicked out of school my freshman year. My art teacher wanted me to take a note to a teacher's classroom, but I had no earthly idea where this classroom was and she refused to tell me. Instead, she sent me to the superintendent, who called my parents and told them they couldn't have me at their school anymore. 
 The rest of my high school years were spent at my fathers business, since mom wouldn't have anything to do with me. We were always at each others' throats. My parents found a home schooling solution and... well, it flopped. Hard. See, I simply couldn't focus, and dad was busy with work so he couldn't take the time to truly teach me. We tried, but after the first year of this he just handed me the teacher's book with all the answers in it. My high school GPA is stupid high, and I didn't do a thing to earn it. 
 To this day, I can barely do middle school algebra. My knowledge of english is about there as well, as is everything else. I didn't get a social life beyond the few people I skateboarded with, and all they wanted from me was my car and money. Friends for me, growing up, were few and far between. 
 Hell, even after high school, my lack of social skills led me to marry the first woman I 'loved'. It ended about like you'd expect. Same with the two after her. I'm twenty-six with a divorce, failed engagement, annulment, and a successful marriage under my belt, in that order. The woman I am with now is the most patient, understanding angel and I'd be so lost without her. 
 But if I could go back? Jesus, there's so much I would do differently. I don't even know where to begin. All I know is that things would be  very  different. So different that I can't even comprehend what would change. My social life would certainly be different. I'd probably be smarter. I probably wouldn't have dropped out of college. I probably would have been smarter about my relationships. I certainly wouldn't have told my mother I didn't love her when I was fourteen. Dad's business would probably be a lot better off. Everyone in my life would probably be a lot happier. I'd probably have a job, and probably wouldn't be so incredibly scared of going back to school. The only skills I have in life are those I picked up from the countless mistakes I've made over the years because I simply didn't know any better. 
 If it wasn't for my current wife, I'd probably be slouched up against a wall with my brains splattered all over it. Her kindness and understanding has shown me that there are good people in the world, and I wouldn't trade her love for anything. She completes me in a way nobody else can. 
 But if I could go back and fix my life? Yeah. I'd do it. I'd do it in a heartbeat. To make right all the wrongs is just too tempting of an offer. All the people I've hurt or offended, all the lies, anger and sadness? None of it would have ever happened, and everyone in my life would probably be better for it.","I'd be smarter, stronger, and everyone in my life would be a lot better off.",26,M,AskReddit
"Growing up a ""tomboy"" in a wealthy, predominantly white, republican suburb exposed me to the quiet whispers of intolerance at a very early age. ""Those shorts are for boys only"" my mother would say. ""But they fit me better, and the pockets hold my gameboy when I don't want a purse."" I would whine. ""Tae Kwan Do is a boys sport. Besides, you love gymnastics!"" This was true, and while backflips and handsprings were important skills, true ninjas were trained in the martial arts.

 I was nineteen and studying Biology in the city. By this age, I grew tired of expensive hair salons full of gossiping women and stylists insisting I pluck my eyebrows. I didn't want their relationship advice or their products wrongfully tested on animals, but I'd never known any other way. 
I had made my usual Wednesday appointment and stood in front of the mirror, critically. My ""Justin Beiber"" style haircut had fallen well below my eyes and although I dreaded it, I knew I had no choice but to get on my bicycle and go. 
 Not even halfway to the salon, the spiraling candy-cane poles caught my eye. I don't know what made me see them this day, as opposed to any other, but I squeezed the brakes and tied up my bike in front of the barber shop. A little brass bell jingled as I stepped through the threshold of a place that would shape more than my hairstyle. 
 At first, the men waiting in line did not even look up from their golf magazines when the barber approached me. ""Hello!"" I smiled and asked if walk-ins were accepted. The man hesitated, ""Well, yes...but this is a barber shop, are you aware? See the deer heads on the wall?"" 
 ""Yes."" I smiled. 
 He stared, puzzled, then shrugged. ""Okay then, have a seat."" 
 I picked up a newspaper and read an article about fly fishing. Moments later, the man called me to his chair. 
""I'm not a hair stylist."" he said. 
 This made me very happy. ""I know."" 
 ""I can only do what I know, nothing fancy."" he said 
 I smiled. ""I know."" 
 He spun me around to face the mirror and I took note of a father sitting next to his young daughter in the row of benches behind me. He put his arm around her and pointed at me. ""That's silly isn't it?"" he prompted her, and she smiled. ""How would you like to get your haircut here?"" he asked the child. She grinned and they snickered together. ""Ridiculous."" he said bluntly. 
 I averted my eyes and enjoyed the silence of the barber. Towards the end, he asked me about school and my profession. He did not try to sell me anything and he did not tell me about my unwanted facial hair. I tipped him well and rode home. 
 It was the best hair cut I ever received in my life. My roommates noticed right away and complimented me. In the bathroom, my laughter turned to tears because I knew I'd never get such a wonderful haircut anywhere else. And I knew for two reasons, I could never go back there again. 
 I refuse to make anybody feel uncomfortable, like I had with the man and his daughter. Secondly, I refuse to make myself feel unwanted.","man at the barber shop made me sad

"Girlfriend came in to my place as I was making dinner, asked if we could talk and then broke up with me. 
 I went away for a night last weekend with friends from college (I'm a senior, she is a junior) and she said she felt relieved when I was gone. To be honest, I felt kind of relieved as well just to get away from the drama of school and all. I graduate in June, thought I had a job lined up for me out of school that kind of fell through. She still has another year left and is originally from a state across the country. 
 Essentially she told me that she didn't feel happy being with me but the biggest thing is honesty. The only thing that she brought up about my honesty is my occasional smoking of weed. At first she was completely against using weed, but after countless fights and such she said that she'd be okay with it if I just told her when I used. We discussed this when I took the trip out to her family's house over the winter break, something that I thought made our relationship a bit more serious. I try to not smoke when I know I'll be hanging out with her later which is understandable. But she told me tonight that she wants me to tell her everytime I do it. For instance last night I went to the bar with friends for a birthday and smoked a little before we left to go out with no intentions on seeing her later on in the night. She wants me to tell her things like that. 
 I think we're both scared of what is coming as I graduate in June and this just may be a way to avoid it, but I could see myself making plans with her outside of school in the long-term. I think she used the honesty excuse to abandon ship to avoid heartbreak down the road which is understandable.

I was in a really bad place, I had a lot of issues with my dad, friends, life, inability to form healthy relationships, more school stress than I could handle (parents forced me into a really elite high school program because I'm really smart, but I could not cope with the workload, and they didn't want to hear that (I was just being lazy). It took a suicide attempt for them to realize I was in over my head). Got on pills, went to therapy, etc. Huge, vast improvements in my self-awareness, emotional state, ability to understand emotions (I am now the go-to advice-giver for all of my friends because therapy and self-focus made me really good at understanding emotional nuances in people and relationships). Anyway, I digress. I got much, much better. I stopped having major depressive episodes because I could notice them and cut them off sooner. I got good at handling my panic attacks. I eased myself off meds at around age 20 after slowly dropping dosages over time, and I did just fine. I also have had ADD since elementary school, and I eased off those meds at around the same time as the others, and I self-treat my ADD with caffeine, which has worked just fine for me (though maybe that's my issue now?). 
 Fast forward to now: I am technically in my senior year of college, but my sophomore year of my program. I had to take 17 credit hours of classes this semester in order to apply for my major for next semester. On top of this, I work 20-25 hours a week to pay for bills, school, spending money. So I have two 12-hour-long class days, one 4-hour long class day, and then four days of work. While none of my classes are ""hard,"" they are all labor-intensive. I could manage them just fine if I stuck to the weekly schedule I created for myself early in the semester, but... I find myself procrastinating, which has always been a bad habit, but this semester more so than usual. My classes are interesting this semester, and I should be enjoying them more than I am, but... I cannot seem to find any motivation. I have to fight with myself to get out of bed in the morning, I have to drag myself to classes, I struggle to complete even smaller assignments. I just cannot find it in myself to be motivated. I have tried bargaining with myself, I have tried tough love with myself, I have tried talking myself through it, and I am getting nowhere. Each week it is getting harder and harder to stay on top of things. It is obviously an insane schedule, but there is nothing I can do to change that right now, and I have already cut back at my job the most that I can (and honestly, my job doesn't cause me any stress, just costs time). I have been dealing with some mild family issues, nothing more serious than usual, and I have gone through two serious rejections in the last 6 months from guys that I thought were into me, but even taking all of that into consideration, I don't feel... depressed. Just burnt out. I have tried taking a few days off, and letting myself do nothing school-related, but now I am still burnt out, and even more stressed, and when I try to take time out and relax, I cannot shake the feelings of anxiety about schoolwork I should be doing and truly relax. I have had a medical issue that has prevented me from exercising properly (going to physical therapy now though), and dorm food isn't exactly healthy, and I'm sure those are both factors, but I don't know what else to do. I just feel really stuck, and down on myself for not being able to get out of this slump and accomplish the things I need to. Like I said, I don't think it's depression necessarily, so I don't feel like meds will help anything. I'd go see a therapist, but a) time and b) I don't feel like I have any major issues or anything that are causing problems, or any issues that I can't work through on my own. I don't know what else to do to get myself out of this slump, but I've got 8 weeks of school left and major papers due soon, so I've really got to figure this out. Any help you can offer is greatly appreciated. Thanks!","Severe burnout, feeling really stuck, not sure it's necessarily depression, but nothing I am trying to un-slump myself is working.

"When I was 7 I was went to the movies with my sister while my mom was at work. It was the mid 90s and the theatre was pretty small compared to today's standards, six screens, but was a big deal then. My older sister and her friend had sneaked into a pg-13 movie while waiting the 30 minutes before my mom came to pick us up so I passed the time in the arcade room, which was just to the left of the entrance. I was the only person in there, there were no patrons in the lobby and who knows where the lazy teen on duty was. Just after I finished playing whack-a-mole with my last quarter this older man appears and hands me some more change. He says he's the ""games manager"" and it's his job to make sure the kids are having a good time. I lived a very sheltered life and really didn't think it was bad to talk to strangers because it never occurred to me that some people did bad things. He chatted with me for about 15 minutes while I played more whack-a-mole, the highlight game of my childhood, asking me what sports I like (baseball) my favorite color (blue at the time) etc. He puts his hand on my shoulder and asks my name, I say "" __ "", which is an obvious girls name. He abruptly takes his arm away and steps back and says ""you're a girl?"" ""Yeaaah."" And he just turns and walks away. I had a very short haircut for the summer and was wearing nothing gender specific. My sister came out, my mom picked us up and I never told anyone about it.

"I'm late to the party, but here goes nothing. I've been a pretty avid bow hunter for a while and I've shot my fair share of deer. Well one year I wasn't having any luck until early one morning in the middle of the season. I was about 35 feet in a tree and this little spike comes in. I watch him for about an hour before I decide to take a shot at him. As soon as I draw back my bow, he looks straight at me. I shoot and he drops like a sack of potatoes. If anyone else bow hunts, then you know deer normally don't do this. They will usually take off running for a little bit at least. So I keep trying to look for a spot on the deer where I hit it but I see nothing. He was in a little bit of brush and I couldn't see his head. So I decide I knock up another arrow just in case. About that time, he lifts his head and looks back up at me... There was my arrow sticking directly out of his forehead. He lets out a gasps and a spurt of blood and dies.

"Hey, r/relationships. Required background: f (me) with m, both 21, together a about 10-11 months. 
 Let's start off with: I'm not used to being in long relationships. In fact, I generally like being alone and bouncing from person to person - I have a problem with getting bored easily and need new things to stimulate me. 
 This is the longest relationship I've been in since I was 16. And he's great. I love this guy and know that I would be very sad if we were to split. 
 My issue is mainly with boredom. This past week I've seen him maybe... four times. We usually hang out with him or a group of his friends or something. I always have a decent night. The sex is great and I'm fully satisfied. But I'm bored. I'm so fucking bored. Last night we went out, walked around a bit and hung out before coming back to my place. After we'd done the deed, I found myself just... wanting him to leave. He was sweet, laying there with me as big spoon, talking nonsense and giggling. But I didn't like it. These days I either find myself wanting him to oscillate between being more romantic and clingy (i.e. telling me how he feels about me, telling me he loves me, blah blah) or wanting him to give me my own space. 
 It's not like we're attached at the hip - we have jobs, lives, separate school lives. We usually text at least a few times a day, but we by no means have verbal communication all the time and aren't overly attached. 
 When we do hang out, like last night, I had so little to say to him. And I know there doesn't have to be constant communication all the time, but the silence was weird for me, not comfortable. 
 I get weird over little things he does, like not holding my hand in a mall filled with couples holding hands [when I could just as easily go to hold his hand, but for some reason find myself never making the effort], or being affectionate in public when I wished he wouldn't. It's like I'm  finding  things wrong with him on purpose, and I feel like a bitch. 
 The other night while we were fooling around, he told me he sees me in his future. He said... like five years down the road, he could see me there. He said I was sweet and beautiful and all these other lovely things. And when he was going on about this, my heart felt full, in love, and I was  so  happy. Because it's not like he just says stuff like that all the time - he's reserved about his feelings and what he wants in relationships. And I never push him to say anything. But after I got home, I was thinking about it and it  scares the mo'fucking shit out of me. 
 My family up bringing was less than stable and loving and now that he's made this expectation that we're going to be together for a long time (and I feel like it's plausible - we get along really well, have good sex, like the same things and rarely fight - we've only had one serious fight the whole time we've been together), I feel like I'm waiting for it to fall apart (since that's all that's ever happened for me.) So I find I'm pushing him away and it feels right, but I know that if I lose him, I'll be so hurt. And it'll have been a waste because what we have is good. 
 The plan for now was to cut contact with him to a minimum for a few days. So I can breathe a bit and try to solve this on my own. I don't want to talk to him about this, because I don't want this to evolve into a bigger deal than it is.","Pushing boyfriend away feels right but wrong.

"I met this girl while studying abroad in Early 2014. We were flatmates and lived together for 4 months in a relationship. Things moved quickly and after this time we did a year of long distance, with 4 visits in that time that amounted to another 11 weeks together, 8 of those where I did the travelling. 
 Things were always pretty great, other than a couple of shakey periods due to school stress and just the strains of long distance. We worked through them and had a special connection. We both wanted to close the distance after our graduations late May/June, and had spoken in detail about potential work visas or marriage. She meant more to me than anyone else I'd ever met and I had never clicked with someone like that before - I could really see us building a future together. 
 Problems started for me just as I was finishing my studies. Our closing the distance plan involved me making the move as I had previously said I would be willing to move to her, and she also stated she'd prefer to stay close to her family.
It had dawned on me that I would need to leave my family, friends and everything else very soon for the relationship and this sent me into a spin, especially realising that I'm still very young at 22. I have a very close relationship to my parents and brother and I was struggling to come round to the idea of leaving everything behind for several years (at the minimum). At this stage it was just doubts but these doubts got bigger when I moved back home and reconnected with my life back there. After 4 years of study pressure and living away it was refreshing to return home and I just settled back into my life for a few weeks. I was pretty happy but still missed my girlfriend and wanted to find some way to close the distance through all these mixed up feelings I had. 
 Things got worse when I told her and she got pretty upset that I was struggling to come around to the move. Communication was bad for a week and in this time she admitted she kissed a friend on a night out, a friend who previously made moves on her and I had raised my doubts on him. I saw this as cheating and it increased my hesitations tenfold, obviously. I started reevaluating my position as a 22 year old and what I should do with my life Although the kiss damaged things it was still ultimately the distance holding me back. 
 This situation continued for a month and as it looked like things wouldn't be resolved we split up. She tried to get me back on track but I was so mixed up in what direction to take that things were never fixed. I honestly can't explain just all the things that were in my head. I still loved this girl but just felt so overwhelmed at the whole situation. 
 Then came a week of boldness that led me to researching travelling and booking this trip pretty suddenly. I am travelling South East Asia for 3 months solo with some time working in Australia to follow. I've been away for 7 weeks and have had a good time with some amazing experiences along the way. I've never not missed my ex but in the past 2 weeks I've felt like I'm lacking something. I thought it was homesickness but I've been thinking about her more and more. It's to the point I go out in the day and imagine the trip with her with me, or I wake up and just feel gutted she's not there. I even find myself comparing other girls to her and putting her on some kind of pedestal. 
 Rightly or wrongly I ended up messaging her and telling her how I was feeling. It was a moment of weakness but she was the only person I felt I could tell. After I backed out of the relationship and didn't try again, she told me she had no feelings for me and blocked out memories of our time together because of the pain. I know there's still something there, however small, because she has said how I'd have to literally be the opposite of myself last summer to have any chance of regaining her trust. She didn't tell me to naff off basically. 
 The fact these feelings have come up after months apart and being on this trip makes me feel like I can't just ignore them. I've considered saving money from Australia and going to see her in a few months. Am I mental? I feel stupid saying all this after the decisions I made last summer but maybe I needed something like this to open my eyes. 
 I guess I'm just looking for some experience and advice on the whole situation. We're not connected on any type of social media and after my messages to her we aren't talking on whatsapp now. I know it's easy to just say forget her and move on but clearly that hasn't happened.",Split up with girlfriend (normal relationship turned LDR) last Summer after being unable to come around to idea of uprooting my life halfway around the world.

"When I broke up with my high school sweetheart of over three years (possibly closer to five, depending on how you reckon these things), he didn't take it too well. 
 It started innocuously enough. I got stuck next to him in traffic often, then uncannily often, and then suspiciously often. I went out of my way to avoid him, trying to reduce the number of run-ins. He did not show me the same courtesy. For the next several months, it was easy enough for me to convince myself that I was just imagining it. 
 ""That could be anyone's purple car with the pirate flag and the Family Guy sticker."" 
""He probably wasn't thinking when he posted that note on my Facebook. Old habits die hard."" 
""That's the third hang-up call today. Mercury must be in retrograde."" 
 The phone calls, emails, and notes increased, and when I didn't respond to those, he began driving past the bookstore where I worked. At that time I was a barista and I spent the entire day standing in front of a huge picture window. I tried not to let it bother me. ""Let him look."" I got accustomed to the drive-bys, but I was still shocked when I looked up from the counter one day and saw him standing about thirty feet away, just staring at me. 
 My managers were very understanding over the following months as I began spending time hiding from him in the back room on a weekly basis. I got promoted and moved out from behind the espresso machine and into the bookstore. I enjoyed the work immensely, but it was nerve-wracking being out of my little corner. Out in the world I wasn't much better; I was constantly looking over my shoulder, and to this day I can spot a Chevy Prizm from approximately eight billion paces. As I got better at hiding, he started driving past my house; case in point, two days after we put up our Obama yard sign, he called me to ask if I knew where he could get his own yard sign. The phone calls and texts returned with a vengeance until I changed my phone number in February. His attempts at contact came in waves. Sometimes I wouldn't see or hear from him for several weeks, just long enough for me to think it had ended. 
 One night at the store as I was walking back in from my break, I saw him pull up alongside the store and look in the windows for a full 30 seconds. His windows were rolled down, and I was about 20 feet away. I wanted to scream at him. ""Are you fucking  looking  for somebody?"" My voice died in my throat as I entertained vivid, Tarantino-esque fantasies of spontaneous revenge. He drove away, never once looking in my direction. I scurried upstairs to the security camera feed and watched him wend his way through the store, methodically going up and down every single aisle. At some point as I was watching him I realized that it was his 21st birthday, almost a year and a half after our relationship had ended. 
 The drive-bys and little visits continued until I left that job six months later for a job with a private ambulance company, and after that departure his appearances slowly trickled to a halt. As of now he no longer bothers me, and my adrenaline no longer spikes when I see a fuchsia Prizm. I still don't consider it ""over,"" though, and I'll probably always be waiting for him to show up again. 
 And to think, all I had to do to get him to leave me alone was change my email, AIM, and phone number, find another job, get a new car, switch to a different campus and move ten miles away.","My high school boyfriend stalked me for almost two years after our relationship ended.

"Some background: I have only been in one serious relationship that started when I was 19 and lasted almost 3 years. We were very close before we started dating, and I seriously thought that we were going to get married. Then apparently he was scared by the commitment and decided he wanted out last year. 
 During the following months, I tried really hard to work on myself. I realized that I didn't like who I was and had a lot of insecurity issues that my previous relationship had acted like a band-aid for; ""he loves me, so there's no need to love myself"" kind of stuff. A lot of it revolves around my weight/body (I am overweight). I started going to therapy and working through insecurities and fears that I have had since childhood and have been really good at ignoring in adulthood. It has been an amazing experience and I'm starting to learn how to accept myself. And then I started to have feelings for another guy. After contemplating whether or not to tell him, I took the leap and told him how I felt and he said he felt the same way. And we've been dating for a few months now and things are going really well. I've been friends with him for a few years, and so I know for sure that he has also only been in one relationship, which was also very serious. 
 Back to the current issue. We both agreed that we wanted to take things slowly at first so as not to ruin the friendship if one or both of us wasn't feeling it. But we have talked about it since and we both really like each other and feel that things are going really well! We haven't had sex yet, which I am fine with. It's definitely getting to the point where things are heating up; clothes have stayed on, but a lot of making out and grinding and hands all over -- it's actually kind of a nice build up. I absolutely want to have sex with him, but I want to talk to him first about my insecurities, considering it's about my weight/body. He has been so respectful and doesn't try to push for anything, which has been helpful because it's given me time to think about my feelings before we have sex. I don't feel like I have to sit him down and have a talk and unleash every detail about these insecurities onto him before anything else happens, but I also don't want to pretend it's a non-issue and have to stop if I get uncomfortable in the heat of the moment to explain what's going on. I do feel that it's both important to share the fact that I am insecure about my body and that this (the insecurity) is something I have been working on improving over the past year. 
 I am just wondering if you guys have an idea of how/when I should bring this up to him. I told myself that in this relationship, I was going to be honest and vulnerable and be my truest self. So far he has been very understanding and sweet, but this is such a close-to-the-chest issue for me that I'm terrified and any guidance would be helpful.",how/when do I bring up my insecurities about my weight to my new SO?,21,F,relationships
"I am an American man aged 25 and I fell for a beautiful German woman I met at my work. She was here working as an au pair. 
 I work on a military base on the western coast of the USA in the recreation department and she would come to my facility a lot with the young boy she watched. We talked a lot and we became friends quickly. We spent some time together in and outside of my work and I developed feelings for her. 
 I'm not the kind of guy to make a move too quickly and I also didn't want to scare her off. I could tell she had interest but was also being somewhat guarded because she knew she was leaving. 
 At the beginning on August she moved with the family to the eastern coast of the United States. Since then her and I text almost everyday and Skype at least once a week. We flirt and laugh and there is a lot of chemistry between us. I have developed some strong feelings for her and think she may have feelings for me too. I haven't said anything because I'm afraid of how she may react. 
 The job I work is a seasonal job and it ends at the beginning of November and starts again in March. My idea is to possibly move to the east coast for two and half months to spend time with her. I'm not going to flat out ask her to be my girlfriend or anything. I just want a chance to really get to know her and and see if this is real. That isn't going to happen with just texting and Skype. She goes back to Germany in March. 
 So my question for you all is: how should I approach her about my idea? Should I just tell her exactly how I feel? Should I ask her how she feels? Is it a bad idea altogether? How to tell her about this idea without coming off as a total creep/stalker? What would you do in my shoes?

"As requested, here's my BFP post (whoa).  I have no idea what I'm doing.  I hope this is interesting or helpful to you! 
 Let me first just say that, after drinking tons of water and peeing constantly all day, I felt like I had to take another pregnancy test at 10:30 pm before posting this to be sure.  The line was so faint I didn't think it would show up and totally freaked myself out.  Nice work! <do not recommend> 
 So, here's my deal: For months, we didn't really get a chance to try because I wasn't ovulating. 80+ day cycles and all that.  At first thought it was thyroid but fixed thyroid and still no go.  We started Clomid.  I was really depressed after failed Clomid cycle 1 and into Clomid cycle 2 (this one).  Looking back on it, we actually had pretty good timing, the day before 1st OPK+, the day of 1st  OPK+, and the day after 1st OPK+ (OPK was still positive part of that day).  I think I ended up ovulating on CD 17.  But we missed our last day together and then I had to go out of town... I basically gave up on the cycle.  It was probably the depression talking, because it wasn't rational.  But it was a good self-defense: in a way, this was the easiest TWW ever because I was totally convinced, without even a scintilla of hope, that this wasn't our month.  I wasn't really tracking my day-by-day progress or obsessively symptom spotting.  I ended up feeling a lot better post-ovulation than the month before.  I really think Clomid did a number on me that first month, and my hormones were less wacky this second cycle.  I also started acupuncture a few days after ovulating. 
 Around DPO 11 this little hope sprung up in me because I didn't get any pre-menstrual spotting, which has never happened before.  I did have a little bit of breast fullness/tenderness and cramping, which was pretty in line with my PMS symptoms, so totally ambiguous.  Except the cramps had more of a localized stabby sensation than an all-over ache, which was - (looking back) different.  Also, I started sleeping a ton and taking unintentional naps, like while hanging out at a friend's house and during acupuncture.  Probably the weirdest thing of all was this epiphany I had,  this sudden moment of physical connection to my own body, where I thought and felt, yeah sure, this body has the capacity to make a baby someday.  This was a thing that, honestly, up until that point, I did not believe.  Completely the opposite. 
 I told myself I could test on DPO 13, the day I was expecting my period.  That morning, I really struggled with whether to test at all because I was afraid of the depression a BFN would throw me into.  But I couldn't resist, since I'd already set the deadline in my head.  For some reason, I decided to do 2 tests at once, a Wondfo and a SurePredict.  I was staring at the sticks waiting for the pink to clear away and leave a blank white slate as usual.  The SurePredict almost immediately showed a line and the Wondfo slowly followed.  Both were clear positives. This is when I started shouting, oh shit, oh shit oh shit!  Because I could not think of a damn other thing to say.  My husband, who'd been gearing up to console me, was superhappy.  I thought I was broken but I'm not! It was the best and most surreal thing. I kept running back to look at the tests, to see if they really had two lines and the tests really were marked ""hcg.""  But it was real.  Crazy.  Still so crazy. 
 Other symptoms that seem to have arisen since the positive test are: peeing a lot more than usual and feeling hot - two characteristics that are literally the opposite of me.  So here I am, crossing my fingers that those tests keep coming back positive and so totally excited for the next 250 or so days. 
 Thank you all your encouragement and support.  I apologize for the wall of text.  I had absolutely no clue how hard this process would be when we decided we were ""ready"" and I don't know how I would have fared without this community to talk to.

"My boyfriend and I are both 23 and have been dating for three years, living together for one. We are head over heels in love and have been since the very beginning. Our relationship is amazing; get along like best friends, great sex life, excellent communication, crazy chemistry. However, an issue has recently come up. 
 He confessed that lately he's been having trouble suppressing his physical attractions for other women. This was never a problem until now. Throughout our relationship, we both acknowledged that fact that we have physical attractions to others, and that it's a natural human thing that isn't a problem as long as we choose to not act on these attractions. Not acting on them has been easy for both of us, until now. He said he is struggling with it and feels unhappy suppressing his physical urges. He misses the chase and thrill of sleeping with new women, especially during his 20s when he wants to be wild and adventurous. The thought if sleeping with one person for the rest of his life scares him. He assures me that it's nothing to do with me, that he is still extremely attracted to and completely in love with me. He does not want to break up and is aware of the fact that what we have is better than sex with random people. This issue has been tearing him up with guilt; he recently broke down in tears talking about it. 
 I appreciated his honesty and tried really hard to understand where he's coming from. I've been reading through similar threads in r/relationships and r/askmen trying to get an idea of a guy's perspective in this situation (my father died when I was young and I have no brothers or close male friends, so I sometimes have difficulty understanding men). However, I'm not going to lie, I'm a little hurt. I feel attractions for other guys too, but I don't have a problem keeping them under control. I don't understand why he suddenly does. 
 We've discussed the possibility of opening our relationship down the line. It's not something I'm ruling out, as I'm not a jealous person and I'm very secure in myself. Additionally, he's the only person I've slept with. I'm curious to know what it's like to sleep with other guys, so opening the relationship would give us both something. However, I don't know if I'm being too accommodating here. Should I be more upset? Are his feelings normal for men or is this above and beyond what guys usually experience? Should he just accept that he needs to suppress his urges, even if it makes him unhappy? Or should I start thinking about nonmonogamy?

We introduced ourselves and I immediately popped in my headphones and cranked the volume, the universal sign for, ""leave me alone"". Not to this dude. He proceeded to tap me on the shoulder and tell me his life story in disjointed bits and pieces. Now, this in itself is nothing to write home about. Just a dude trying to pass the time on a bus. While it was super annoying as I was attempting to sleep, I just put up with it and listened to the dude's stories. He had been traveling around for work and just seemed lonely. Then it happened. Early in the morning, around 6-7 the dude reaches into his bag, pulls out a tube of toothpaste... Then proceeds to eat the entire, fresh tube like its his last meal. Shit gets a little weird with him after that. His random taps on the shoulder and stories got stranger, and he became almost manic in his tellings of them. Made me feel bad for the dude. He was nice enough, but clearly had some shit going on. There was also a dude that looked like Dog the Bounty Hunter, with a skullet, who drank a 5th of whiskey in about an hour. He was a cool guy though. Oh, and when the bus stopped in Compton to drop a few people off before heading to Santa Monica, this crack head tried to get on (I guess he thought it was a city bus) and said he was headed downtown. The driver tried to tell him it was the wrong bus and the crack head FREAKED THE FUCK OUT. He started screaming about he bus being racist for not picking up a black dude. All kinds of crazy shit. Then Dog and another big guy wrestled him off and the driver floored it out of there. Ended up making it to my buddy's place just fine, albeit pretty tired. Never taken Greyhound again.

"First up: I'm hopelessly addicted to this awesome game. The addictive formula works. I agree with many of the stated weaknesses and am super happy to see Bungie being so responsive, and kind, to the community. I love this game more than any game since DOOM 2! Playing networked over serial cables strewn between rooms in the mid ‘90s. IMHO Bungie knocked it out of the park. 
 But I think I might be burnt out... What's going on? And what happened in my first Raid experience last night that fueled these feelings? 
 So I'm tooling around doing some strikes and one of my destiny pals invites me to Raid. I've been trying to run with his crew for a few weeks but it's never worked out. Again, it fails, someone is tired, and someone’s kid is sick or has to leave, a fortiori. So we stop. I'm in the tower spending some hard earned vanguard marks. As I'm about to go to bed, it's getting a bit late (9pm) and I have a cold. I get the invite. 
 I join. 
 We spend the next 10 minutes messing around in the tower. Laughing our tits off with a cacophony of ""Xbox Record That!"" being shouted as we make human centipedes and engage in generally puerile behavior. A bunch of adults appreciating the opportunity to act like children in a virtual world. 
 ""Shall we Raid then?"" One of the crew pipes up. 
 ""Oh shit yeah, taking us to orbit"" Says our party lead. 
 Before I know it I'm defending plates, having more fun than I thought was possible with a rocket launcher (I've only got the grenades and horseshoes upgrade). I get my first Raid loot chest! Oh snap, it’s some shards. 
 We get in and do the Templar with just a few wipes. Communications is generally good apart from some audio issues (?) that force peeps to drop and rejoin. Everyone is in good spirits. 
 The maze... WHAT... THE... F **  not sure how I'd do that without my team Sherpa's. I see why the first run took half a day! It's creepy and brings back claustrophobic memories of real life caving. I die and don’t even know why, dropping in the dark I guess. But it’s exciting and I make it through with another chest or two. More shards, wait… what? 
 It takes us a few runs to get past the Gorgons and get to the chest. Yay! A different loot reward! Energy. Damn it. Wait… maybe this is a good thing. If I got raid gear it would just feed my addiction, right? 
 I #epicfail on the jumping game and joke “Is there a pattern? I try and I fail. I’m just gonna randomly jump.” I do… and, it works out. I’m having fun. 
 So we get to the gatekeeper and have a few runs. Communications is breaking down. One guy is getting pissed off. There are some more communications/audio issues. Then as we are getting into somewhat of a groove we lose someone. “Damn it.” I think. “I wanted to drop. I need to go to bed. Too many late nights and this damn cold.” But I soldier on. We all do. 
 So, you solo’d the raid? How? I’m impressed. We were 30, 29, 28, 28, 27 at this point and just couldn’t handle the minotaur’s AND defend the plates AND do the portal running thing… I don’t even know what those guys were doing in the portal, sure sounded tense. Maybe I’m spending too much time on this game as I’m shit at it?? :-) 
 It is 12.30, lethargy is setting in, brains are misfiring, and some guys are a time zone or three ahead. 
 We quit. I feel a little bitter at not completing and getting gear. But I’m cool. 
 So I’m torn. Again I have another whole evening spent on this game. Time I could spend working on a hobby I love. Time with my wife. Or time investing in my career to get ahead at my white collar job which I’ve spent years and years climbing the ladder and working hard to be successful at. And I’m asking myself what I should do? I don’t expect anyone but me to have the answer by the way, I’m simply sharing in the interests of stimulating a dialog. 
 I really do love this game. I’m just getting bugged out by the addiction. Let me repeat. I LOVE this game. I even enjoy farming, well I guess it is a part of the addiction cycle. Farming is social. Farming offers another game type, which you can mix with side missions. I enjoy it. 
 By in large I also love this reddit community. 
 Ironically I don’t spend half the amount of time as many other people do on this game. I’m 28 and 1/3 or so… I’ve logged about 150hrs or so since launch and have ONE character. At risk of slamming vast swathes of you and I really don’t say it to be dick the thing is I just have to assume many people in this game simply don’t’ have the responsibilities in the real world that I do. You can’t? Surely? Can you??? I feel like I really need to go back to feeding other things in my life (and am going to). Ideally I’d like to find a balance to not “have to” play as much, but still to play as I’d love to keep the game in my life. Just dialed back. As a next step I’m going to try and cut out till the DLC. I can go test my aspirations of doing things in the ‘real world’ and see if they feel worth it ;-) 
 Any way guardians. This is how I feel after my first Raid. So you can see why I don’t mind not having got any raid gear :-) as it would merely feed my addiction. 
 P.S. Bungie /u/DeeJ_BNG could you perhaps make it a little bit less addictive? Just a thought; that might also make it more assessable to people joining now who see a ton of 27+ running around and the potential associated “oh my how will I get THAT high with the time this is taking” reaction. Maybe not, just speculating.","I love this game, I love this community, my first raid was stupid-fun which I’m glad I didn’t get any raid gear because I just feel this game is taking up far too much of my life with how addictive it is. Fingers crossed I can find a way of spending 1-2hrs a few nights a week vs. what feels like 2-5 hrs 5 nights a week that I’ve currently been running, recently. But for now… I need a break. Bungie can you make it a little bit less addictive please? :-)",28,M,DestinyTheGame
"I worked as a shift manager at a Pizza Hut  a long time ago. It was 1 of the 2 busiest in NY state cause its right off of route 81. I didn't like to wear the button up shirts like we were supposed to and as a delivery driver-turned manager, I felt it would be better to look like the rest of my crew and just wear a polo. I also felt it best to lead by example and work with everyone like normal rather than have the appearance of someone who looks like they're a boss (cause who wants their former co-worker/friend telling them what to do now? Also I promise I'm going somewhere with this). So yeah, the store just ran better that way, everyone got what they wanted, customers and employees went home happy every day. Never a problem. 
 One unusually busy day we ran out of large pizzas (more were in the proofer, we were just waiting on them), so we were giving out 2 mediums for the price of a large instead until the large dough was ready. Nobody had a problem with it, except this one guy. So, I hear him going off on one of my waitresses and I go out and ask what's up. ""I want a large pizza and you are out of them! How can you be out of large pizzas?!"" This guy was really just being a dick. I told him ""Sir, we are giving you 2 mediums in the place of a large for the price of a large. What seems to be the problem?"". 
 Oh dear. I must have done it now. He wanted to talk to the manager on duty cause I was fucking with the wrong pizza patron. So to his amazement when i told him I was the all powerful MOD, he didn't believe it, went on a tirade, had a nearby coworker verify that I was the boss, continued his dickery, and it got him removed from the restaurant. After he was gone we were back to normal in our family friendly environment.","Grown man threw a fit over pizza and got kicked out of the store by a 19 year old in a crew shirt.

"My name is Jordan.  I am currently a freshman in college.  I was exposed to pornography at a very young age (12) and have been addicted to it ever since.  Over the years I have felt like I was missing something, something that I couldn't/can't explain.  I felt depressed and decided that porn was my way out.  Every time I felt down on myself, upset, or just plain bored, porn was the only thing that I always came back to.  It comforted me.  Or so I thought. 
 After every ""session"" of pornography that I viewed, I felt guilty.  I felt like I had done something so despicable that no one would ever forgive me.  That was the beauty of porn though.  ""I'll never get caught.""  I said.  To this day I have never told anyone about my struggle with porn addiction.  I was always either to embarrassed or afraid to tell anyone.  I shudder at the thought of what my mother or father would say should they ever find out. 
 Recently, I have garnered an obsession with hentai.  As an anime fan, hentai has become a hugely addictive substance for me.  Worse than regular porn to some extent.  A few days ago I decided that it was a good idea to purchase a hentai dōjinshi game.  This is the only piece of pornographic material that I have ever spent money on...  And I regret ever doing it. 
 I now realize just how bad my addiction has gotten and am going to try my best to completely eradicate this addiction from my life.  I don't want anyone of my friends or family to fall victim to this vile addiction and need help in overcoming it myself.

 I was at the local convenience store, looking through magazines and saw that one of the porn magazines was on a shelf I could reach (they were normally kept on the top shelf, out of reach of children).

"Hey /r/TwoX, I'm sorry about the size of the post but I'm just a mess right now... could really use some female insight on this. 
 Me, 21f, dating 23m for ~6 months. Just broke up about half an hour ago. 
 I want to approach this in an as unsentimental manner as possible, which is proving difficult as it happened so recently. But here's my attempt: 
 We have been dating for six months but have been close friends for about a year. When we started dating, he had been broken up with his girlfriend of 2 years for about 2 months (she had moved to another city). It was understood that he had been harbouring feelings for me for the last six months of their relationship, and as he put it, was essentially waiting for her to leave. 
 When we first began dating, it was euphoric. I felt extremely comfortable and close to him almost immediately. We were able to talk for hours on end about very intimate things, as well as shared passions (music, art), as well as dealing with mutual emotional issues (depression, anxiety). Although we would sleep in the same bed, he requested that we not have sex until it felt like it was real. After a month, we had sex and it was agreed that we were exclusive and that there was definitely something strong between us. 
 Since we had both come out of relationships fairly recently, we also decided that we would communicate all doubts, worries, anxieties, neurosis, etc. that we felt regarding the relationship so as not to have anything muddle it. This was very easy because we were already so comfortable with each other. 
 About three months in, we had a situation where I had been stressed about outside factors and had not addressed them in the manner previously discussed. I ended up taking out my frustrations on him, causing him to retreat and subsequently break up with me over the phone. His primary reason for this break up was that he felt like he couldn't handle the pressure of being in a relationship, and that he couldn't give as much to me as he felt I needed. This break up was short-lived, however, and we ended up back together after meeting up that night and having a long talk about things. He seemed absolutely positive that he was back in it for the foreseeable future. We agreed that he, indeed, needed ample space, and that I was more than willing to give it to him on the condition that he communicate this need to me when he felt the stress coming on. 
 Our relationship was fantastic for the next three months. He became one of my best friends, we shared many things together, and cultivated each others' passions, interests, and emotions. I felt more connected to him than I had felt with any past relationships, as well as arguably more than some of my closest friends. I have never experienced this deep level of emotional connection before. 
 Leading up to now, I can, with conviction, say that I saw no warning signs. He did not feel distant, he was physically affectionate, bought me a very thoughtful and kind birthday present, was emotionally available, and communicated his need for space well. 
 Tonight, we had come back to my place after hanging out with friends. He was very sweet the entire night. When I asked him to come to bed, he simply said ""There's something I want to talk to you about"" and told me that he wanted to be alone, and that he needed to be alone at this time in his life. 
 I essentially poured my heart out to him, communicating how much I valued him, and felt that he valued me in the same way. I am 21, yes, but I have been through a lot of emotional hardship in my life (abusive father, bad family life) and trust my perception completely. I have been going to a counsellor for about a year and have done a lot of emotional work on myself, enough to love myself and see what value I have as a human being. Because I trust my own emotions and perceptions, I believed he truly valued and loved me as well. 
 What I cannot understand is if one is in a relationship where both parties are mutually beneficial, communicative and supportive, where both people grow and flourish by being with one another, how can one party value the need to be alone above such a beneficial, loving relationship? I'm so confused. If I feel like I have trust in myself to really love him, then why doesn't he want to be with me? Does this mean my self-worth is wrong? 
 As he was leaving, I asked, ""Will you regret it? Do you love me?"" and he answered yes to both. If he loves me, and knows he will regret it, why break up? 
 I apologize for the wall of text. I'm so shell-shocked right now, this really came out of left field and I'm just... a mess. Any insight would be highly appreciated.","Boyfriend of six months broke up with me tonight because he felt like he needed to be alone, I did not see it coming at all.

"My boyfriend (23M) and I (22F) have been dating for 3.5 years. We met in college and now he is working back home while I am a few hours away for graduate school. 
 The issue: This past summer my boyfriend and I got into a serious conversation about our future living situations if we ever end up getting married. He was set about living with and supporting his parents for…well, ever. His parents do not work due to certain issues, so my boyfriend and his older brother are the ones supporting the family. 
 I tried letting him know that I might not be okay with it, but I don’t think it got through to him. I was also unsure about the entire situation at the time. Ever since then, I’ve thought about the whole thing and realized that I would never be happy living in that type of situation. I tried really hard to force myself to want to live with them, but I just can’t. I’m an introvert and really value my privacy and alone time. I also come from a small family of 4, whereas my BF’s household is around 7 people. 
 For me, marriage is about being independent and moving into a new space to create your own family together. If I move in with my BF, it would be me moving from my parent’s household…into another household. I want to create my OWN household. I also feel bad because I wanted to earn my master’s degree (this is my final year) so I could ensure that I could be independent once I graduated and get a job. I guess I won’t feel like a true adult if I move in with my BF. Is this selfish? 
 This sounds horrible, but I want to spend my marriage mostly with my partner, not his family. I really do love his family, btw, they treat me like family, so I feel even worse about not wanting to move in with everyone if we ever get married. They’re great people, but I would like to be alone with my partner so we could experience our lives together. 
 Is my relationship doomed? My BF had said that he could not compromise on this, but I haven’t talked to him about this and I don’t think he knows how serious I am now about not moving in with his entire family. I am planning on talking to him about this soon (talks of marriage/engagement have come up again recently and now I’m anxious to talk about this BEFORE we move forward into any of those things). What are some things I should mention when I talk to him? I am really bad with words/speaking (I lose track quickly and forget to say important points), so any ideas will be helpful. I'm really nervous because we never fight or argue, and this is one of the biggest serious conversations we will have in our relationship and I feel like breaking down just thinking about any negative results.","BF wants to live with and support his family forever after getting married, I want to be independent and get my/our own place.

"I am a fairly new redditor, but have been lurking for a few months now. I see that most of you give positive insight on most things and I think that is remarkable.  Seeing this, I thought that maybe I could clear my mind of some things and maybe help others who have been in or are going through likewise. 
 These last 5 years of my life have been pure and absolute hell.  I am 20 years of age (21 on the 16th), and when I was 16 I received the worst news of my life.  This was when my mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer... 
 These years were hell, I was in a never ending hole of depression.  I was always close to my mother and I loved her with every bone in my body.  Receiving that news broke my heart in two....it was world ending.  The cancer would come and go, giving us false hope that everything would be okay. During this time, I just sat in my room refusing to be social or communicate with anyone. 
 Never tasted alcohol until I was 17 when I heard that alcohol made you put life behind you for that little bit of time.  Alcohol played a big part of my life a little over a year ago when my mother lost her battle with cancer.  I was hurt....scarred...terrified...enraged.  The only thing I could think to do was to drink.  I got to the point where I was almost downing a 30 pack a night and blowing my whole paycheck on beer.  I was so depressed at this time that I tried killing myself with alcohol.  I just wanted it to be painless, I didn't want to remember how fucked up this world is.  I would never try this again but I think this can explain what the situation would do to you. 
 With the help of friends and my father, I bounced back to being somewhat....contempt.  This was until I lost my job, and lost my grandmother due to cancer.  I am here now, typing this story after being broke up with yesterday.  I am just at that point in life where you realize that it is never a cake walk.  The situation has hurt me because none of my friends have been through the same experiences as me and I feel like I can't openly express myself to them.  If one of you have a loved one with cancer, you have my deepest sympathy.","Lost my mother and grandma due to cancer, suffer depression, lost job, former alcoholic, got broke up with yesterday.",21,M,self
"Some relevant medical history:
24 years old, female. Have been taking birth control (Mononessa) for eight years now. Same pill, same dose, same schedule (relevant in case hormones are a factor). I have Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (and take Synthroid .075 once a day for it) and was diagnosed with Chronic Migraine at 18 (and have been taking Topomax 100 mg once a day for it for about a year.) 
 Almost exactly a year ago, I had to get an MRI done for an episode of fainting I had (which ended up being brought on by low pressure caused by three different medications I'm no longer taking). The MRI was relatively normal, but there was a ' Benign cyst submucosal aspect upper right pharynx'. 
 I've never had problems with allergies until I moved from Maryland to Northern California, and now I get them pretty regularly in the spring and fall (hello pollen count from hell). Recently, though (within the past three months), I've begun getting extremely bad sinus headaches that I would almost call sinus migraines (are those a thing?). At first, I contributed it to my allergies, bought some Benadryl, and called it a day. 
 Benadryl doesn't work. I don't have any other symptoms of allergies besides a random pain in the left side of my nose (right where the bridge of my nose starts). I'd contribute it to the cyst found, but it's on the other side, and in my nose as opposed to the back of my throat. The pain can range anywhere from ""someone's kind of putting pressure on my nose"" to ""oh my god I think something just exploded in my face"". No kind of OTC pain killer (Advil, Excedrin, Aleve, Ibruprofen) has helped the pain / pressure at all. 
 I've also had two nose bleeds since the head aches started, though they weren't 'random'. They both happened after a particularly loud / hard sneeze. The pain isn't where my migraines have started (I've had very few of those, thank god). I have also noticed that more times than not, I can taste blood in the back of my throat, but I never cough any up or spit any out. 
 I'm looking for some insight as to what might be causing this, and how to get some relief from it while I'm setting up an appointment to get in with my ENT doctor. Any help is much appreciated!","New pain in left side of nose. Thought it was allergies, but it's not. Help!",24,F,AskDocs

"I (35F) don't know what to do with myself. He (36M) has been my only thought most every day since he broke up with me two months ago. I chose to drink after four months of abstaining. I had had abdominal surgery twelve days before, and with my limitations and his busy schedule we weren't seeing a lot of each other. I started to feel like he was spending less time with me because he didn't want to take care of me while I was healing. I let my drinking problem convince me that it was he who had the problem. So I drank at home, alone while he was at roller derby practice and the subsequent party. The next day he saw a bottle I didn't pick up and ended the relationship just hours later. He had given me an ultimatum two weeks earlier that I'd somehow lost sight of: drink and we'd be through. 
 I stayed in the ""it's his problem"" frame of mind for another day. When I woke up on Tuesday, I snapped out of it and realized what I had done. I researched programs and contacted him to let him know that I knew I messed up majorly and that I was wrong, told him my sobriety plan and asked him to please come to the couple's session we already had scheduled for the next week. He responded that he was willing to talk and listen but couldn't promise anything more. Due to a him getting a blown tire and not having a wrench at 3am on Thursday morning, he ended up sleeping at my house, in my bed, in the nude, while we talked and cried. We talked some more that afternoon, and things were sedate but hopeful. We made some plans to get together over the weekend, but I wasn't able to get to him on Friday, and he wouldn't come to me on Saturday or Sunday. We were able to get together for lunch on Monday and kiss goodbye, one week after he broke up with me. 
 Things quickly went downhill from there. The next evening, after a show his band played, he denied me a kiss and told me he needed some separation between our friendship and our romantic relationship. Over the next week and a half he stopped replying to any texts concerning our relationship, like whether he was going to come to the couple's session, but was still bantering with me as long as I kept things platonic. I also began to have suspicions that he and one of my best friends (34F) were becoming involved. I decided to try the friendship approach, because I missed him and because I figured if I was in front of him, maybe he wouldn't get distracted by her.  We had a late lunch once and hung out a bit afterwards. It was terrible. I was miserable. If it was bothering him, he kept up a good face . It was tearing me apart to have him there with me and not be able to touch or kiss him. But I decided to keep trying, hoping maybe his love for me might outweigh his hurt that I drank. I tried to arrange another get-together on Friday, but he said he couldn't go out all weekend due to laundry and cleaning in preparation for a new roommate. I had decided to go to Septemberfest to find friends (not to drink) to distract me from the fact that he wasn't interacting with me. Said best friend lives across the street from the hosting bar. As I was leaving the bar, I saw his car was parked in front of her place. We'd been broken up less than three weeks. I texted him asking if he was doing her laundry as well. 
 Angry, hurt, accusing texts and emails were exchanged from there. We argued over every point except why he was at her place after blowing me off. Sunday I told him that while I realized what he does is none of my business, I couldn't do the friends thing. We did stay in contact to tie up loose ends of the relationship like owed money and forgotten possessions. His birthday was one month after our breakup, and I had already bought the gifts. Despite much advice to donate them, I wanted him to have them and arranged to bring them to him and exchange other things. Against my better judgement, I stayed to watch him open his presents. I could see that he was touched; they were the only presents he'd received. The whole time he was acting like everything was normal in this little friendship of ours. I had to leave before I balled. That night, I researched ways to kill myself and make it look like an accident. 
 The ""best friend"" confirmed what my instincts had already told me, that they were seeing one another. I told them both to go fuck themselves. At this point, we had been broken up 5.5 weeks. I tried to contact him two weeks later because I remembered something else of mine he had and was told I have a wrong number. I don't even know what to make of that. What would have been our one-year anniversary is this Sunday. I've been composing a letter to him over the past week which has become less and less angry and self-pitying with each revision; I still don't know if I'm gonna send it. I came here when I tried to finish it up and couldn't. I've lost a not-so-good friend and an wonderful man who had been an amazing boyfriend. I am so angry at him, but I love and miss him even more. Mostly though, I'm angry at myself. I sacrificed a wonderful relationship in which I was happy for a six-pack. 
 Edit: added a point I forgot","I broke my boyfriend's ultimatum against drinking two months ago and he broke up with me. After three to five weeks of confusing signals, one of my best friends confirmed they've been seeing each other. I'm having a really hard time dealing with it all.",35,F,relationships
"35 here. Let me tell you my story. 
 Catholic, didn't believe in sex before marriage, wanted to be a priest. After graduating from College, I spent like 4 years working because of family finance problems. Went to seminary, lost my mind due to the horrible treatment I received there, mental unstability, recovering... then I'm 34 and realize I need a girlfriend. Big shock, I may be too old to get a girlfriend now. More depression, more problems... long story not worth mentioning... 
 Hit the gym, reading self-help and flirt books, going out... I go to clubs and bars once in a while, and fail miserably. But I've also gone to bars with my workmates to just chit chat and have a couple of drinks. 
 There's also this girl that I had (and still have) feelings for. She's like my dream date, but we haven't got to meet offline. She's already got a boyfriend, and once in a while, they break up, and get back together the next day. One day I finally confessed and told her that if in a near future they definitely broke up, that I would be grateful if she considered me as an option because I really liked her. It was a cathartic moment and I'm grateful that I said it. They're still dating, but there's a possibility now. 
 Lessons learned: 
 
 Don't expect to have romantic feelings for ANYONE. It's the first steps of dating, you just get to know each other and become ""friends and maybe if things go well..."".  
 The only way to know how to do well in dates is with practice. Start with online dating sites. Propose to just be friends. 
 Don't expect romantic feelings. I've made several female friends with online girls (most of them in other cities), and they've helped me a lot and viceversa. 
 I have actually gotten offers for one-night-stands. Most of the times they chicken out, but I'm cool with that because it didn't feel right (I'm the kind of guy who can't go to bed with a girl if there aren't emotions involved). But at least, I know that potentially I'm  not a loser. That helps with my self esteem. 
 There are girls interested in guys my age. Takes a while to find them, but there are. They're just not the kind of girls that I'm attracted to. But it's a start. 
 If you have constant episodes of depression, go to a therapist. Screw what the others will say, it will help you. Meanwhile, you can read books on healing emotional wounds and all that. 
 There are speed dating companies, and other companies specialized in standard dating, and parties, etc. 
 Don't focus on only dating. Make new friends, both male and female. Offline if you can, but it also helps if they're online friends. Several girls (some even married or with boyfriends) have given me their shoulders to cry on, and it feels awesome.  
 Try joining social clubs, going to dancing lessons or whatever.  
 The problem with being ""Forever alone"" is not so that you don't have a girlfriend, but that you DON'T HAVE A LIFE. When you start developing friendships and having a social life, a girlfriend will be the middle-to-long-term consequence.","You're forever alone until you start developing a social life.

"So to preface a little, I realize 2 months is such a short amount of time, I am on this board under my real name often. 
 I am divorced. I was with my ex for a very long time. I was neglected. He was out at all hours, cheated, lied, and had a great amount of debt he hid from me before I decided I had to leave. I tried to work it out for years, and he refused. I serial dated shortly after he moved out; trying to figure out what I did and didn't like, but I was going after the SAME guys. It wasn't until a recent boyfriend who was extremely controlling and mentally abusive, I realized I needed to stop. I needed to fix my self-esteem. I stopped dating, and I read a few self help books. I got better, I focused on myself for a couple of months. I was selfish..I did what I wanted. I took hour baths, went to the spa, I went to movies alone, I went to bars to have a beer alone and read a book. I went shopping to make myself feel good, not look good going out. I went dancing with girlfriend. I felt so great. 
 I started dating again...I met two guys who were really great guys...but just didn't fit what I wanted, and I was able to easily break it off, after 3-4 dates. Then I met *Eric. I met him online. We talked for two weeks before I gave him my number. When we met in person the conversation never stopped. He's smart, hilarious, and still opens the car door for me. He loves my cats, and the one that hates everyone likes him. He's so affectionate, tells me I am beautiful even without make up on, and I believe him. I trust him 100%, and I mean 100%, blindly. 
 Everything has been fantastic until about a week and a half ago. He's been distant. I finally call him out about it...I mean he's been depressed, not his laughable self. 
 Trying to keep this as general as possible, he had an ex..he wasn't this great person he's always been. She was, and she changed him for the better, which I am thankful. While she changed him, he changed her for the worse. She then turned around, and took that out on him, and they had an all out war on each other and nearly destroyed each other. They had to break up. They were engaged. Last week was the anniversary of the engagement. He is over her, but not over the relationship if that makes sense. For me...I understand because for a long time, I was over my exhusband but did not ""mourn"" the death of my marriage. I didn't get over that relationship because I figured I was over him...so I was fine. 
 So...he broke up with me. It was probably the nicest break up ever. We both cried. He said he needed to go get help and didn't want to destroy me along the way, or hurt me anymore. He wants to still be friends right now because he cares about me so much, and he still has incredible feelings for me. That he has an amazing girl in his life, and he has this horrible past he has to shed first. He said he kept having trouble sleeping feeling guilty for being with me, comparing it to this last relationship (it's the only real relationship he had as well), and then looking at how great we go together and feeling guilty for not being able to get over it. Two weeks ago he said he was falling in love with me, and I brought that up, and he said that is still very much the case. He's a very private person and said he only trust 3 people, and I am one of them. 
 I believe everything he is saying...I am just so hurt right now. I can't sleep, I cry just about 60% of the day. I don't know what to do. I've had break ups, I've moved up...leaving my husband was hard...but I didn't feel like this. I know it sounds ridiculous because we've known each other for such a little amount of time, but him and I just go so well together, I am not 17 screaming true love. I am completely able to be myself around him, he loves that don't hide my shitty taste in music, listens to the spice girls when I ask him to play it, listens to my favorite jokes even though they are so dumb and laughs because I laugh so insanely at them, we are both SO obsessed with dinosaurs we have debates over who would win in fights, I can talk freely about my messed up family and so can he, he is the first person I want to call about EVERYTHING, we confess all of our food sins to each other (we both work out), and he is still the first person I think of when I wake up, and the first person I think of when I go to bed...although now it's full of tears. 
 I am so sorry this is long I am just at a loss.","32/M BF broke up because he hasn't worked through his past relationship, we still have feelings, he's going to get counseling to get over his first real relationship where they almost destroyed each other...but I am so lost.

"It was Atmosphere. 
 In 2003 I was a confused, disgruntled teenager struggling to figure out why I was so angry with the world -- like a lot of kids at that age, I guess. I was listening to generic nu metal sludge like Korn, Slipknot, etc. because I felt I could relate to the anguish expressed in their music, and the ferocity of the music was a great release. 
 I was surfing through the music channels one day and caught the beginning of ""Trying To Find A Balance"" ( Until that point, I'd always written hip-hop off as this childish, juvenile form of music that was ""beneath me"" somehow. This track totally blew those misconceptions away. In Slug, I'd found a rapper who was infinitely relatable (that hook still resonates strongly today) and in-touch with his emotions, but not so much that he sounded soft or overly-emotional. 
 I bought the album and was immediately hooked. No idea how many times I listened to ""Seven's Travels"" growing up, but it was a shitload. Thing is though, I still held onto some of my stupid ideas of what hip-hop was all about, and assumed that Slug and Atmosphere were the only guys writing the kind of stuff I could relate to. A few years later, when ""When Life Gives You Lemons..."" came out, I realised I'd really grown to like the sound of guys rapping to a beat, and got into backpacker faves like Aesop Rock, Buck 65, etc. 
 Then, 5-6 years ago, I realised I wasn't really experience the genre's full breadth, so I asked a friend for recommendations. He put me on to ""Reasonable Doubt,"" ""Illmatic,"" and ""Ready to Die,"" and I've been hooked ever since. Now I can jam anything from Juicy J to Clipping and feel satisfied. I don't often listen to other forms of music any more, and I certainly don't touch metal like I used to.",Atmosphere.,16,M,hiphopheads
"this is my first post- So I'm sorry if I'm giving to much info- but my mom was and is... well... insane.

I still told her "" too bad."" She has... tried. but she is still the same, undiagnosed person under it all.

CLEAN IT CLEAN IT!"" on repeat for about fifteen minutes. She then came upstairs to inspect with the ( massive 90s) video camera. That video is on the home movies.

"So me (21) and my fiancé (27) have been together almost two years. We've been living together for a significant amount of that time, and we're getting married in less than a month. We are insanely in love and crazy about each other, and I wouldn't trade him for anything.
He does A LOT for us. He works full time, and pays rent, etc. I'm on his phone and health care plan. Needless to say he isn't a useless bum. He takes care of me and I take care of him.
I work part time, and my hours are slowly getting cut, and I may lose my job soon. So I feel like I'm obligated to do most of the cooking and cleaning. I don't MIND cooking, per say, but I really feel like, especially on his days off, if I didn't cook he wouldn't eat. It's very frustrating to cook all three meals, do the dishes for those meals, and prep his meals for work.
Tonight I got very frustrated because dinner was just not going right at all. After I had finished cooking, he asked me if there was anything wrong, and I said I was just frustrated. He asked if there was anything he could do to help, and I said that I would appreciate it if he would help cook dinner every now and then, just to help out and have input on what he eats, and I guess as a favor to me. He got a little quiet, and then said that he was sorry, that he'd try to help more. But then he said ""I don't really see where I need to do anything else, as I already do so much, but I'll try""
Now that hurt, a lot, because I was already feeling guilty about asking him. Should I just forget about it and hope that he offers to help, or should I just tell him that its ok and I'll do all the cooking from now on? I'm trying not to feel bitchy and demanding, and it's hard :/","I feel guilty for asking my fiancé to help out more and idk if I should 
 edit  UPDATE: Hey guys! Thanks so much for your advice. I actually just talked to him about it and expressed how I was feeling about everything. He's agreed that I do waaay too much cooking, but at the same time he feels like, since he does so much to provide for us, that it is my responsibility. We've decided to start scaling back meals, and cooking dinner together a few nights a week. Thanks everyone!",21,F,TwoXChromosomes
"To give you all a little background (I'll make it short) basically I love motorcycles, had fantasized about getting one for years. This year I decided to move 800 miles from friends and family, become 100% independent, and buy one. I am only 19 but I graduated when I was 17. In October I got my endorsement, passed the tests with 100% (because this is a passion that I just hadn't previously had the opportunity to fuel), and bought an '09 Kawasaki Ninja 250r for $2200 (2.5k miles). Since my purchase and endorsement, I have ridden twice a day, every day (through every condition, and I'm in Seattle) slapping on 1,000 miles. Recently though, I've been craving a little more. Looking at some 600s, a shop in my area has a used but pristine '09 Honda CBR600RR, which from much research and shared opinions is pretty much my first pick for an upgrade. For weeks I've gone in, sat on it, and fantasized a little, but yesterday I finally went for a test ride. I had never been on a 600 before but my GOD it felt good. I was afraid it would be too much, but it was the most natural ride I had ever been on. It was smooth, fuel injected, and the way the engine purred gave me goosebumps. Sitting on it felt incredibly comfortable as well. The first owner of my ninja was short and had it lowered. Sitting on it, my knees are bent pretty far (which I was ok with for a starter bike, but is now quite annoying), but on the CBR my legs were a comfortably straight leg flat foot. All in all I basically felt like the middle school girl who just got told she was cute by a boy. Completely in love. 
 SO. My request from whomever was patient enough to read all/most of that is should I invest in this bike and lock into a 3-4 year payment plan after trading in my 250? What the shop is proposing to offer me as trade-in value for my bike is $2k (there's some cosmetic damage from the lest two owners but nothing too bad) and after the trade-in value I would have to pay $5800 for the 09 CBR600RR. I have checked craigslist and none are currently for sale in my area. My conflict: as I said I am only 19 and have taken a year off, but might take another semester off to be able to afford school (residency school cost BS). Currently I make enough to pay my bills, live comfortably, and pay off this bike of I choose to. I am wondering though if school conflicts with work, that would conflict with my paychecks, which inevitably would affect my budget for a motorcycle. The shop did say that if I were an amount of time into my payment and I decided I wanted a different bike I could transfer the payment over (I'm a homie there). For those who are experienced in this type of situation or have financed a bike before please lend me your advice. I REALLY want this motorcycle but don't want to act on a whim.","I want the CBR600RR but I'm 19, a student, living on my own with no financial help and it would put me on a 3-4 year payment plan.

"In high school and my first year of college, I had it. I was great. I was a great athlete. I was an Texas All-State football player. In college, even though it was a small school, I dominated. My coaches always told me to keep pushing, keep my grades up. BE SOMETHING. I couldn't. I could not juggle school with collegiate football. I wasn't mature enough at the time.... Even so, I never could have done anything serious with football anyways because of my stats. ( too short, too slow, too white; for my position) Till this day I still do great in my everyday things... I am now a great fiance'( I wasn't always) and I do great at my job. I try not to cut corners, always think about safety ( which is a big deal in my line of work) and have had 0 incidents. Yes, that is great... 
 But I am yearning to be ""Top Dog"" again. Maybe this is ""Uncle Rico"" syndrome, but damn I know I can do big things with my life. I did Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and MMA for a couple years, on and off. But never really pursued it in the passion that I did for football... BIG REGRET I guess... Because I was good... I got into it because of this whole, "" find something you are good at, pursue it, be great"" mentality that I have. 
 But now with the demanding job that I currently have, it is not something that I can practice everyday like the sport requires that you do. So frustrating to have to ""grow up"" and get a job that makes you push back things that you really want... I guess the competitor in me is just trying to break out. I have time to go to the gym and lift weights, but why can't I find time to join a BJJ/MMA gym and just do that instead... I guess it comes down to scheduling. 
 My job schedule is literally the most inconsistent thing you would ever see. You cant even see a schedule of it really. I am on call 24/7. I wish I had more consistency in my life. My beautiful fiance' puts up with my schedule, somehow, I have no idea how she does it, but she does. She is so encouraging and is always there for me. I know she feels the same way about her self as I do about me.(she is a championship horse jumper, and can not pursue what she wants to do) Growing up sucks, and I am only 26 years old typing this. I feel like the last of my youth is seeping away, when really they should be in front of me... 
 I am sitting in a room in North Dakota just waiting for my phone to ring so they can have me go out and do a job at 3AM. ( I work in the oil and gas field) She is at home in Colorado, waiting for me to come home...
 I am definitely compensated fairly, beyond fairly. But at what cost... I can't do this forever... what will I have to look back on when I am old and decrepit? And I am not talking about my marriage and kids, because I know that I will have all of that and I know it will be awesome.I know my lineage and my life will be great.... 
 I guess this is a vain search of myself, to find one last thing that I can be great at, personally. I just want to be awesome again. I want to be great at a sport again. And I know my problems seem so menial, and I am glad that they are, but I know I can do something so awesome. I just have no idea what it is... 
 I just feel so late to the party on almost everything. Even things I excel at, I am behind. I get too overwhelmed in my mind by the thought of somewhere out there a kid as been brought up since basically birth, to be better at the things that I want to be great at. Does anyone else feel that way? I have always thought like this... I have always thought that everything I wanted to do was ""too big"" for me to accomplish... I cant ""eat the elephant one bit at a time"" I really wish I could. But, alas, I am not wired that way. I want to be great again... 
 Some people might read this and say, ""this guy just wants to be famous."" That isn't true. I just want a sense of self purpose back. I want to be the best at something again. Maybe I wasn't the best, obviously I wasn't. However, in that time frame, it felt that way... That feeling is what I am chasing. I want to be great again... 
 I already feel better just typing this whole thing out. If no one ever reads it, then it is not a big deal to me. I can go back and try to figure me own shit out....","I want to be great in something, personally, like I was when I played football back in high school and college.

"I always felt fat when I was her age and younger. I don't ever remember  not  feeling that way. However, I don't think any of my peers have ever told me that I was fat or overweight or unattractive due to my size. Never. Not in elementary, middle or high school. 
 So let me clear this up: I'm 5'2"" and the heaviest I've been is around 135 pounds. When I was growing up, I was always about ten pounds heavier than the average girl of my height, according to my doctor. I think it was because of my doctor telling that to my mother that led to this. 
 My insecurity about my weight came from my mother. When I was little, she often called me ""fat little girl"" in Mandarin. That was my nickname. I guess she really took what the doctor said to heart and believed that I was constantly ten pounds overweight since the age of 6 or something. I'm pretty sure now that it was just the way my body was built. My mom is a health nut. We never had soda or junk food in the house. She portioned all of my meals. I don't know why I was overweight, if you can even call it overweight. 
 But there's nothing wrong with a mother trying to get her kid to eat healthy, of course. The part that bothered the fuck out of me was not only the ""nicknames,"" but also how she felt the urge to comment about my weight to fucking everybody. I was playing with my cousins while the adults were chatting (in Mandarin, so I couldn't understand them, but I heard my name pop up occasionally). Then my uncle came up to me, and in front of my cousins, said ""You shouldn't eat so much! You're gonna get fat!"" On another occasion, my mom was talking to my grandmother about how much food I eat and how it was the reason I was so fat. My grandmother said, ""Tell her not to eat so much or the boys won't think she's pretty!"" During my teenage years, my aunts and uncles loved to squeeze my arm fat and say, ""Wow! You're so big!"" And no, they didn't mean ""Look at how tall and grown up you're becoming!"" 
 Even now, when I'm at an age finally well enough past puberty for my body to have finished shaping itself, at 5'2"" and 120ish pounds, my mother still tells me to lose weight. She'll point to my thighs and make a ""so thick"" motion with her hands and say ""I think you would look a lot better if you lost ten pounds."" ""You should lose ten pounds."" ""Lose some weight, you'd look a lot prettier."" 
 I look at myself in the mirror and think, ""She's full of shit. I'm fucking hot."" But some days, I'll look in the mirror and believe she's right. 
 Dang. Well, I didn't mean to type this much out. I guess I resent all the ""you are fat"" commentary a lot more than I thought. Um...",My insecurity problems started when I was younger than 9 and the cause was my mother.,26,F,TwoXChromosomes
"At the beginning of January I had a vasectomy done in Madrid (Spain). I'm 32 and married with a wonderful woman (34) who also wants to be CF, and we had been thinking about having it done for a couple of years. 
 Last Christmas, when she was having her anual gynecologist exam, the doctor said that if we were sure she could arrange a meeting with the urologist for scheduling it. Everything went OK (and the doctor didn't give me any ""speeches"", just made sure that I/we were really sure), and I've already passed the ""precautionary"" amount of time, so I should be CF by now. I still need to get a sperm count done to make sure that it went OK, and my wife is still using the pill until then, but I wanted to share it with this subreddit. 
 As for the vasectomy itself, it was done really quickly, and I didn't have too much pain afterwards. I only had some pain for a couple of weeks after, but mainly from the stitches. Once they fell I don't really notice anything anymore, and everything works OK :-D. 
 There is only one thing though, one of the testis is a bit higher than the other. I think it may have to do with the shape of the scar, as it is a bit more to that side and it may not allow it to go down as much as the other. It doesn't hurt, and it will probably go away, but I also wanted to share it here, as I didn't see of anyone who had this same issue. 
 So, as for now I'd recommend it to anyone wanting to do it. If you have any question you want to ask feel free to do so :-D. And well, if you have had the same issue please, let me know how it ended :-D","Had vasectomy one month ago, everything went OK, open to questions.",32,M,childfree

"Me [19f] and my (ex?) boyfriend [19m] have been going out 3 years. We met in school and continued our relationship on to college. We're both in second year now at different universities in the same city. (Maybe 20 min apart). For the most part, everything is great. We get on well, can talk about anything and just generally enjoy each other's company. However, there have been several recurring issues and yesterday it all kind of came to a head and we mutually (or so I thought) agreed to call it off for now. 
 It started off with a fight, we do have arguments but generally we make up pretty quickly. However, this one was different - it started because I wanted to take him out to the cinema and for a meal (its too complicated to explain why, but I felt like I'd inconvenienced him a lot over the last week and wanted to make it up to him). When we got to the cinema though I realised I didn't have any money in my account (bank can be slow transferring it). I got a bit upset over this, he then insisted on buying me lunch, which upset me again because I really wanted to treat him for once and not have him feel like he had to pay for me. Then on the way home he got really angry about how I'm never happy with anything he does. This escalated then and led to a lot of other problems being brought up.
His family. This is the big one. He has a very large family and is close to almost all his brothers and sisters and their children, even though some of them are 20 years older. He has always tried to get me to talk to his family and get on with them. However, his mother has pretty much disliked me from the start, when we first started going out she used to badmouth me to him constantly, saying I wasn't trying to get to know them and I must hate her because I never talk to her. At the time I was 16 and completely terrified of talking to her and saying something wrong. She also came up with several (in my opinion) completely baseless assumptions about me, e.g. I was slut who was just using him for sex/to feel better about myself etc. It kind of seems like she's determined to get pissed off about anything I do and take it personally. So this pretty much put me off trying to get along with her entirely, however for my bf's sake I tried to make small talk with her but it was still very awkward. As for the rest of the family, I get along really well with his younger brother, but the rest of his brothers and sisters don't seem to know what to say to me (I feel pretty much the same). I'm a pretty shy person generally so when I'm around them I usually try to stay quiet to prevent awkwardness - they're all at least 10 years older than me and pretty outgoing. I feel like we don't have much in common, but I do like them and they have always been polite and welcoming enough. 
 Anyway, that got very long, but his brother is getting married in a month in a different country. I kind of assumed I was invited because he's been to a few of my family's weddings, I was looking forward to maybe getting to know his family better as well because I haven't seen them in a few months now. Any time it got mentioned though he'd bring up different reasons I shouldn't come (too expensive, no room in the hotel, etc). Finally, it came out yesterday that he told his family not to invite me because he didn't want to have to ""mind me"" all weekend and that I'd stop him having fun. And the reason I haven't seen his family recently is because he's been deliberately keeping us separate. He also said he doesn't want to keep having a ""double life"" like this and that his family is the most important thing to him. 
 Hanging out in college. Like I said, we go to different colleges a short bus journey apart. We also both have very few hours of class per week, so lots of free time to hang out. However, sometimes I feel like hanging out with him during all my free time in college is holding me back with college work and making friends - for example, some girls in my class invited me for coffee after a lecture, but I had to leave after 15 min to meet him, I felt really rude doing this, but also guilty for not wanting to hang out with my bf when I was free. Even when I specifically tell him I want to hang out with a friend or get some work done, he will get annoyed or text me the whole time saying he's really bored. He said to me that he feels like I act inconvenienced when we meet up, or that I want to be somewhere else. I feel really torn on this, because I really enjoy hanging out with him but I also need some time for myself. I've tried to explain this to him but he generally just takes it personally. 
 Curious about being single. Even before our argument we were discussing how he hasn't been single for 6 Halloweens in a row. He said it was ""sad"" how he was always the guy with a girlfriend. I sometimes feel like we both want to experience being single in college, but are just too afraid to lose each other. He has flirted with girls in his class on Facebook and denied it to me until it was confirmed by his friend. I know he was considering breaking up with me when we started college. I guess I did too, to be honest. I don't want to miss out on college life but at the same time I don't know what to do without him. 
 We had this fight in person and then made up but didn't resolve anything. Later on we talked on the phone and I tried to get him to discuss how we could work out all of the above problems (there were more, but in my opinion those are the biggest). He didn't really seem open to discussing it, just saying he didn't want to make things worse by fighting more. We ended up fighting more anyway. Then yesterday morning we talked again on Facebook (I know..). Reading back on the conversation, it's really weird. We agreed we were at a point in our relationship where we had to decide whether it was worth it to keep going. It felt like both of us had just given up, really. I know our problems might seem pretty easy to resolve to an outsider, but they're things we've been arguing over for months. So we decided to break up and stay on good terms rather than drag things out and end up resenting each other. We also said that while it wouldn't be a 'break' (in the Ross and Rachel sense I guess) that in a few months we should meet up and discuss everything and see how we felt then. I guess just trying to lessen the blow. 
 So I was upset about this, but it seemed like a pretty perfect way of ending things - I didn't see how our relationship could really move forwards, and there's no point dragging something out because we're afraid of how much it'll hurt in the moment. I thought he agreed with me that it was for the best and that we could hopefully be friends once it had all died down. But he kept texting me yesterday evening, starting off saying he was sorry for how it went but that we were doing the right thing. Then that his mum was really upset about us breaking up. Then a really long text saying that he knew we could work things out, that we gave up on everything too easily and he'll change everything because he loves me more than anything. We also talked on skype for a while and he basically repeated this. 
 At this point I've written more than some people have about their divorces, so I'll try keep it short. I tried to be as objective as I could in writing this, because I genuinely think both of us are the problem. I just don't want us to resent each other (which we're already starting to do). And it's also a time in our lives where both of us want to experience stuff on our own... I just don't see the point in dragging out something when we could end it now and save ourselves a lot of heart ache. He's usually the level headed mature one but I feel like he's just afraid of change... 
 I don't know what to do reddit! Neither of us wants to break up, but I think we might need it. Its kind of a heart/head situation. Any advice? Please tell me to snap out of it and cut contact/ get back together/ go bother someone else with this story as necessary...

"I'm not sure if I classify as skinny fat or overweight. I'm an 18 year old male, 179cm tall, weigh around 70kg and still look kind of fat, at least without clothes on. With clothes, it's not too noticeable aside from the manboobs. 
 Anyway, I was on a diet 2 years ago and lost about 1/3 of my bodyweight. I ended that diet a little more than a year ago, but have been debating with myself whether or not to start again. I don't just have loose skin, but fat stores in places like my belly, chest and (especially) my legs. I'm concerned though that I might lose too MUCH weight, how do I tell? I've been told that BMI is not entirely accurate for someone like me, as I've lost a lot of muscle from my previous weight loss which is factored into your ideal weight. 
 I've also recently bought a bench and barbell to start working out. I'm not sure if it'll do much without eating above my TDEE, but I'm too afraid to let my weight go back up again.","As an 18 year old male who's 179cm tall and currently weighs 70kg, how much more weight can I lose at maximum without causing concern?",18,M,Fitness
"Dude]( Yeah, it might not work out as you imagined, but at least you will have done it. 
 I'm a big emotional pussy and it sometimes takes weeks for me to recover from bouts of ""courage"" (or as I would call them now ""fuck it"" moments). Examples: 
 
 Walked up to a waitress I had been dreaming about for days and asked her out --> ""Sorry, I have a boyfriend."" … bummer... alright 
 
 Had a girl over in our flat (flat share) that I had been plucking up the courage to kiss after discussions in our group of colleagues. Couldn't go to sleep, cuz I still hadn't kissed her and she was ""right there"", so I got up, walked over into the darkish room, woke her up and planted my lips on hers --> she pulled back, eyes wide open and an expression of absolute bewilderment and surprise --> I ask ""again?"" --> ""no!"" to which I respond ""alright"" 
 
 asked a girl on fb (that I had met once irl) if she was up for a one night stand or friends with benefits --> ""I'm no that type of girl. NO!""

"I've been dating my boyfriend for a little over a year and a half now, but we knew each other and were friends for around 2 years before we started dating.  When we began seeing each other I had just graduated from college and he was in grad school, now I have a good paying job and he's still in grad school working toward a Ph.D. 
 Almost since we first began dating people in my life, family and my best friend in particular, have not been fans of him.  Normally you would think that's a huge red flag about someone but I just. don't. see. it.  I don't know how much detail I should give here because there's so much crap that's relevant, but I don't want this to end up as a huge story of the last two years of my life so I'll put a few bullet points: 
 
 I'm an engineer and my job requires a lot of travel 
 
 He's in grad school for engineering and will have his Ph.D. in another 1.5-2 years 
 
 We had to be long distance for about 9 months around 6 months into our relationship because of my job.  It was a ridiculously good opportunity and he encouraged me to take it when I wasn't sure because I didn't want to mess up our relationship.  We obviously worked through it with him coming to visit me a couple of times. 
 
 We now live about 1.5 hours from each other due to the location of his university and the location of the company I work for.  So that I don't have to travel any extra than I normally do for work he normally comes to visit me most weekends unless his research prevents it. 
 
 
  One of the main gripes my mom and best friend especially have against him is how he makes very little money (just his university stipend) and I make a lot (around 90k/yr).  They sometimes give me the feeling that they think he's bumming off me and ought to have a part time job to pay for dates and such, but I feel like it's bs.  He never asks me to pay for things, but I will ask him if he wants to go out to dinner with me, for example.  Although if I come to visit him instead of vice versa he always cooks for me or buys dinner because I ""had to use my gas"".  And as much as he's in the lab there's really no time for a part time job.  My best friend is in the master's program for a Communications degree, taking *one* class this semester and is using that for her frame of reference because she also has a job at the university.
 
 I should also mention that with the boyfriend I was dating before him, my best friend often mentioned that she felt I should date around more and party more before I settled down and I feel like she's feeling the same still. 
 He also made a bad first impression with my family because he came with us on a family trip to the aquarium and, being a little socially awkward and shy, didn't talk very much besides talking to me.  This came across to my family as very rude and they've held on that idea of him ever since, even when he's come to family gatherings later on and been very nice and tried to make conversation (except with my mother who basically won't talk to him). 
 There's more but if I tried to get into every little detail I could probably write a novel.  I really don't know what to do here.  I love this man so much and could see myself marrying him but I don't know how I can if there's all of this dislike for him coming from people I care about.","I love my boyfriend, but my family and best friend don't",25,F,relationships
"I was maybe 16 when all of this started, but a much older man from the small town I lived in, who was also the mail man, started crudely hitting on me. At first, he made weird comments about how I was beautiful when he would deliver the mail to our family business, such as, ""you have luscious lips"" or ""I would love to run my fingers through your beautiful hair"" and my mother never told him to stop, even though most of this was in front of her, I was underage and he was almost 50. I dreaded the mail delivery every day. The last time he said something before I said something to another person besides my mom, was at a street festival where our business had a booth. It was summer so I was in shorts and a tank top, and I'm pretty large chested, he comes over, leans in, puts his finger on top of my shirt, kind of pulls it out and says, ""god, what I would do to be in there..."" my younger sister was in the seat next to me with her jaw hanging down, gets really pissed and tells him to fuck off. I told my mom and she laughed and said, ""why don't you just go in a date with him? It's just one date and you get a free meal out of it? He's got a lot of money."" After that, one of our older male customers said something to him and he backed off.","Older creeper hit on underage me, over the span of a year, mom just laughed it off.",16,F,AskReddit
"My life story as of late in a nutshell, I'm a high school senior, graduating in less than a few months and I'm very lazy but want to change. 
 All my life I can never remember one thing I've ever put a substantial amount of effort into, let it be sports, school or money/jobs. The thing is, I'm extremely ambitious and a Capricorn and know that if I put an effort in I can achieve great things in my life. For some reason, all I do with my spare time is make it leisure time, I'm passing school with the minimum grades because I never do my homework, I just end up hanging out with friends, dicking around on the internet or smoking weed and sleeping. 
 I put things off until last minute let it be anything, my friends call me ""Clutch City"" because everything I do is at the last minute and ends up being a life or death situation, I fucking hate it. It makes me anxious and worrying that I'm forgetting to do something right now. My organizational skills are 100% non-existant, anything I remember to do is because someone reminded me or I made myself remember. 
 I worked out for a bit, but its very on and off. I stopped going because its slightly inconvenient for me to get to a gym cause I don't have my own car and have to bus, but its a bearable trip. I quit soccer as a kid because I hated putting in the effort to run, and I had alot of potential to make it to higher up clubs. 
 I have trouble dedicating myself to things and finding motivation in ANYTHING, even girls. All my life, I remember being suppressed by my mother to not do things out of irrational fears out of the worst thing happening, so I've been a pretty awkward kid with a small circle of friends until last year when I decided to change that. 
 I feel like even my skills with girls are being impacted by this because since I've had this fear of failure/success/rejection as a kid, I never put myself out there and pulled ballsy stunts to show girls how I truly feel about them. I read quite a few self-development articles and books, novels on how to date and do things because I think I never actually learned how to do anything properly, I think I'm pretty weird and think much differently than most. 
 My father never really was the man that would teach me how to do things and talk to me seriously about life, but has always been very supportive of my interests and spoiled me as a kid.","I need to stop being so lazy/weird, but I have no idea how to start doing that..

"I was a born-again Christian, who became a new-ager, who went back to Christianity, who has always had questions, who became an agnostic, and who is now atheist.  Been a hell of a journey for a 52yo, and not popular with the coworkers (shouldn't have read Atheist Manifesto at work).  My husband, a life-long atheist, has patiently waited for my wakening. 
 What did it for me?  The [Lord's Prayer]( to start.  I liked it when I was Xian because it placed faith first, understanding, of course, that God knew your needs better than anyone.  So as I knelt praying, reciting that prayer over and over, asking for wisdom and guidance, I was ""guided"" to the realization that Jesus didn't put himself in the prayer at all.  Hmm--curious.  The only thing I could come up with was that Jesus knew he wasn't as important as God.  I liked that. 
 But there was a problem with that.  I'd been taught that Jesus was God, that the holy trinity was never to be questioned--""father, son and holy spirit"" were all one in the same.  How could Jesus, who was both God's son  and  God, not see himself as important as...himself?  Not logical.  To me that was a huge clue that Jesus didn't see himself as God.  Maybe his son, or follower, or obedient servant, but not the Big Guy himself.  Well, there was a problem with this... 
 What am I to do with the Holy Trinity?  Obviously there wasn't a God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit (btw, has  anyone  ever been able to define what the holy spirit is?).  At this point, I'm thinking that while I still like the Lord's Prayer, I cannot support the [Nicene Creed](  Church was just not happening at this point. 
 Fast forward several years, many books, exploring many belief systems, and I start wondering how the hell it is that  any  being exists that pulls the strings and played a part in creating the universe.  Then came Reza Aslan's book  Zealot , and I'm ""ruined.""  Jesus was a man, but he was a Jew most of all.  He believed in God because everyone did, because everyone had to.  Which made me wonder more...where did the idea of God come from?  Well, I think now that man created God to explain what he didn't understand.  The more science helps us understand, the less we'll need a god. 
 So there you have it.  I've come out.  My husband and I have a lot more to talk about.  (As an atheist, he's a better Christian than most Christians I know.)",The Lord's Prayer started me on the road to atheism.,52,F,atheism
"Hello! I just wanted to share my not-so-unique experience of playing LiS with a parent (as I have noticed a lot of people already have done that). it might be a long post, so forgive me:) I don't have any gamer friends in real life I can share it with except my bf, but he didn't play the game yet, so I'm happy to share my experience with you guys. 
 We played one episode per week on each Sunday, and it was really fun from the start. I didn't expect my mom to get into this so much tbh. She's used to me showing her my favorite shows/movies or even anime here and there but this was her first encounter with a video game, and I wasn't sure how she'd react. 
 After we finished the first episode a month ago, she basically said ""Wow, this is fantastic, it had me hooked from the first minute"". Of course, I was the one doing the actual playing, while asking her about choices or just doing things how I thought they should go to see her reaction. 
 What I absolutely  didn't  expect in this whole thing is that her views and opinions, as well as fascination with the rewind mechanic mirrored my own. She said things like ""Basically, so many times in life you wish you can go back and change things, or endlessly keep wondering what would happen if you chose differently...so it was really interesting to watch all the different scenarios like seeing Max taking the blame for weed, or hiding instead."" 
 I guess that's why it's so captivating. Not just the characters and the story, but the perfect balance between storytelling and the gameplay mechanic with the rewind. There is no right or wrong - you are the sole judge in every scenario. 
 Basically, watching her reactions was the best part of course, seeing her stare at the computer screen like a little kid in awe, laughing her ass of at Victoria getting a paint shower, being delighted whenever Chloe appeared on screen, and praising the music and bird sounds. 
 Out of curiosity, I asked her what her opinion on Chloe was - because I know for a fact a lot of people didn't like her up until later episodes, and a lot of people don't like her still. Her answer was basically how I also felt: ""I'm not going to judge her or anybody else in the game, I'm more of an observer, so I try to understand what they are all going through. It is obvious that Chloe is in pain, but I think that's why you play as Max - so you can try and help Chloe, and make up for the fact Max wasn't a good friend to her in years they were separated."" 
 After that I asked her ""Do you think Chloe is bad influence on Max?"" - to which she brushed it off before I could even finish the sentence ""No, not at all. Chloe is reckless and has a lot of angry outbursts but she isn't a bad person at all. She encourages Max, not always in the best ways but Max does the same to her, so it kinda evens out."" 
 It was also very interesting to hear some things from a more medical standpoint, since she is a doctor - more specifically the situation with Nathans medication and Chloe's alternate reality ""situation"". Whenever we'd find some meds Nathan was using, she'd point out what they were (like anti-psychotics etc.) and would later on ramble how she has dealt with people like him (and junkies) in her carrier, and went on to explain how exactly they affect people around them. Pretty fascinating stuff. 
 The thing what she said about Chloe's situation surprised me actually, basically ""Seeing her in that wheelchair was pretty shocking and sad, but it wasn't 100% realistic - if she can move her head it means that her spine didn't break at her neck, so she technically wouldn't need a respirator to breathe - so they probably just added the tube for the shock effect.  If she were completely paralyzed as they said, she wouldn't be be able to move her head at all. It didn't bother me though, it was well done overall"". 
 When faced with the decision whether to ""help"" Chloe out or not, I decided to accept her request, then later asked mom to share her opinion, as I was curious.. she summed it up like this: ""It's a game, so it's easier to make that choice, especially if you consider you're given the option to go back and fix it with the photo. It was definitely better for Chloe to let her go in that situation, but I don't think I could do the same thing in real life. It's a difficult matter. I kinda suspected that Chloe was screwed from the moment Max stopped William from dying, and when you go back to save Chloe again, it's obvious that the lesson is that you can't save everybody, there will always be consequences."" 
 I can't exactly remember all the details since we played once a week, but I honestly didn't know how she'd react to the ending and all. In my first playthrough before this, I saved Chloe in the end, and I'll probably do it whenever I play, but after reading some rather...unpleasant comments from some people who saved the town, I was a bit scared of being judged, so I straight up told her that there are two different endings, and I'll play through them both and let her decide what she thinks is best. So when the ultimate choice popped up, I just told her ""Ok I'm going to first choose the thing I didn't go with when I played"", and she cringed and shook her head with an audible ""Noooo"" when I hovered my mouse over the ""Sacrifice Chloe"" option. So haha, I kinda knew in that moment that she also didn't like that choice either. So after watching the goodbye, the kiss, the death, the funeral, and the credits, we went back and saved Chloe. 
 So of course, I had to ask her to give me her opinion and views on the endings and what it meant to her personally. I liked her response, but it could be due to my bias, still, I remember exactly what she said: ""It's hard to judge what is morally correct in this situation, when you look at the sheer numbers, you can say that yes, definitely saving a lot of people over one person may feel more right. But if you were faced with such impossible situation in real life, who knows what you would choose? Who would be left to judge you? How much time you would be given before making that decision? The choice is easier here because you're the one deciding for Max, and I felt really sorry for her, that so much burden, responsibility and guilt was dumped on her shoulders, it's simply unfair. But yes, I think that she would ultimately choose Chloe over everything else. And honestly this whole time, through all the episodes, I had the feeling the story would end this way, that everything is leading up to the point where Max is ultimately going to have to make a large sacrifice for Chloe, I just didn't know what the price would be. One thing that was persistent through the entire story was Max sacrificing all these things for Chloe, her photography carrier, her health, other people, constantly putting herself in extreme danger just for her. She went back with photos so many times in the last episode, if she did it any more, she would probably get brain damage (nosebleeds), but I don't think she would care if that means Chloe is ok. Everything we have been shown so far is in my opinion, leading up to the point where Max would do absolutely anything, and sacrifice everything, even herself for Chloe. She was constantly expressing her wish to stay alive with her. Max isn't the every day hero, she is there to be Chloe's personal hero. So to me, this ending is better and feels more valid because they'll have each other and they can heal together from all the trauma. They need to stay together. Besides, even if you sacrifice Chloe, I don't think Max could live long without trying to go back once more. At least that's my impression. Everybody probably has their own interpretation."" 
 So there we have it, if you haven't played this game with your parent, your lover or your friend, give it a shot, you can learn so much and experience the game from their point of view. It obviously left impact on my mom too, since she is still talking occasionally about it, praising the characters and how it's better than most movies. 
 Thanks for reading, and remember these are all just personal opinions and stuff. I was happy to share this, and don't really expect praise for playing a certain way. I guess I'm just really surprised and happy to play the game with somebody inrl and they end up almost mirroring your exact opinions and views.","Played the game with mom, it was awesome and fun, and try it yourself, you can learn quite a bit.

 Then I found out one of my friends were friends of her and learned somethings about her. She was the complete opposite as me, while Im shy and SAP on the inside and hide it with a light hearted class clown approach. She was a wild drinker and hid it with being shy. But the grade 10 logic of mine was ""cute nerd girl aahhhhhhhh"". Needless to say, I didnt have the gigantic golden balls to confront her about my feelings. I was close to once or twice but either my dick sucking douch of a friend was there to witness my rejection (aside from being a SAP, Ill admit I was overweight and ugly), or she wasnt there when I took painkillers to prepare for rejection (ya....I was a SAP with no experience, little friends, and a connection to the internet)

She has a Bachelor's of Arts in English and may eventually go to grad school. We are both employed by Academic Institutions. We have a combined yearly salary of approximately $98K before taxes. I speak English and a little Spanish (very little, but enough to get around the touristy parts of Mexico) and my wife speaks English and French (fluently). 
 I'm looking for answers to the following:
1> What is the best site for finding european job opportunities and applying for them, i.e. what is the EU Monster.com and Dice.com alternative?
2> Any suggestions on which country we may try for? I've thought about the UK (for linguistic reasons) and Denmark (for it's social programs). 
3> Expats, what is the biggest culture shock that I can expect and any general suggestions about living abroad? 
 I know I have more questions but this is already long enough for a beginning.

"I remember growing up around beer. Growing up in rural Canada, my parents and their friends loved to end the hard farm-work days with a cold beer, generally a lager/pilsner (Labatt Club, Light beer, etc). At a young age, they would always give me the last sip of beer. As I got older, I refused to take the final sips of the beer.. as I didn't like  that  taste of lower quality lagers. 
 Fast forward severals years later (going from age 9 or so to age 16-17), I start to try beer again, like any kid at that age. I developed a love for Kokanee and Molson Canadian. Around age 19 (I'm 26 now), I thought to myself ""I doubt I could ever be a beer snob or drink really dark beer."" So, I accepted said challenge. I tried Unibroue's La Fin du Monde... I remember my review stated that the beer tasted like ""black licorice"" and that the stuff floating in the beer (yeast?) really made my gut turn. 
 Fast forward, the next summer, I drank only Trois Pistoles the entire summer for beer. After that, I developed a new appreciation for beer. Stout doesn't make me gag anymore, that maltiness of a low quality lager annoys me. 
 Somehow I've made more friends from a love of beer than nearly anything else. I guess living in middle of nowhere helps point out who else are the beer fans in the area.

"Hi All! I've been lurking for about 35 weeks? So it's probably time to say hello. I'll be at 37 weeks tomorrow! Woohoo! Baby you can come out anytime now!! 
 I'm 29, SO is 32. He works 100+ hours most weeks. So, sometimes it gets lonely. He has been incredible, though. Couldn't have asked for anyone better. First time for both of us. We don't have any idea what we're doing. 
 Pregnancy  has gone like this: 
 1st Trimester: Vomit all the time. Then Zofran. Vomitting stops, nausea continues. 
 2nd Trimester: Smooth sailing... Except she seems to be growing her butt into my gall bladder surgery scars. Internal scar tissue is stretching. Ice pic-like pain most of the time. I highly recommend ice packs if you need to get your LO to move. First bit of cold and she swims her tiny bum away. 
 3rd Trimester: I guess it's been fine. BH contractions ALL the time. I anticipate going late based on family history. So, I've settled in for the long-haul. 
 Current Issue:  It seems like  every  conversation I have goes something like this: 
 Everyone: ""Man, you look uncomfortable"" 
 Me: ""Well, getting close to the end... about a month left!"" 
 Everyone: ""HA! You  think  you're going to be having a baby soon, but it's going to be a long, long time."" 
 Me: ""Uhhhh... sure? Thanks?"" 
 I have the above conversation 15 times a day at work, and I had it about 5 times yesterday with extended family at Thanksgiving festivities. Even if I go 2 weeks late, it's STILL about 1 month left. Everyone needs to learn math and calendars. 
 Also , I just want to give a super big shout out thanks to everyone on this subreddit. Even though I haven't posted until today, I've learned so much from all of you. I respect your nonjudgmental patience with each other. I have quietly been loving this community as a wallflower for many, many months. You are all amazing, strong parents and parents-to-be.

"First of all, I’m 32 years old, single, employed, and totally financiallly-independent. I pay all of my own bills and do not rely on my parents financially at all. 
 There are a few reasons I’m considering this and would like to solicit some advice, comments, insults, opinions, etc. 
 1) My parents have had a rough couple of years, especially my dad, and I would like to help them out. I also feel like this would be a great opportunity for me to strengthen my, somewhat strained, relationship with them. My dad has lost both of his parents in the last two years, has had two surgeries in the last year, and has dealt with other health problems. My mom should have retired years ago but is still working. She is also on the verge of becoming a hoarder and I would really like to help her get the house cleaned up and all the junk moved out. 
 2) I’m trying to start my own freelance web design business and need some time to work on builing a portfolio and a client base. As well as save some money. I think if I’m able to quit my job and live (almost) rent-free I would have the time to really work on that. 
 3) I need a break. My problems are nowhere near as bad as what some people have to deal with, but I feel like they’re more than I can handle at the moment. I feel like I’m not really living; just existing. I hate my job. I’m overweight. I’m depressed. The friends that I have are either married, in relationships, and/or don’t really have time for me. Life is just really bland for me right now. I really feel like I have no reason to stay where I am, but I’m not financially capable of just picking up and moving somewhere else. 
 This might sound kinda crazy or stupid, but I have this (almost romantic) idea that by spending some time in the place I grew up, in the same bedroom, I can “restart” my life in a way. And really get some perspective on where I am and where I want to go. Away from all the distractions that surround me now. I look at it as kind of like an extended vacation almost. 
 My plan is to stay there for a year. No longer. And get my freelance web design business going, lose some weight and get in shape, help my parents out around the house as much as I can, read some books, write some songs, work on other creative projects, and hopefully gain some perspective on who I am and figure out who I want to be. Is this crazy?",32m wants to move back home to help his parents out and figure his life out.,32,M,AskReddit
"I personally am a pretty big guy; 48-49 chest, 18.5 collar, weightlifting, etc. My first guidelines are sleeve length and shoulders; shoulders need to fit right off the rack, sleeve length goes to my tailor. Once those are set, in most suits I like to have as tight of a sleeve as I can without it restricting movement; once it starts to feel tight on my biceps when I try to bring my phone to my ear, I know it's too tight. On the other hand, too much material makes my arms look bulky and out of proportion.

"Okay I have never posted here before and I don't write often so this might suck. 
 Me [19F] Popeye [18M] I guess have been dating for about two weeks in this time we have not spoken to each other outside of our two hour math class.

"At least, I'd like it to work out. 
 I'm 21/m, and she's 19/f. We've known each other for about a year now. A romance for three months, and a break for about four months to tie loose ends with her previous relationship. Since then, we've been us spending time together because we never really got the chance to have a true relationship, and still hold a strong bond together. But it's started to trend in a direction that neither of us enjoy experiencing. 
 
 I think I've been holding the relationship between us to too high of a standard. 
 I've desired so strongly for us to be back in love, to have those moments of transcendence. I've tried for them, because they came so easily before. And I suppose I've gotten a little bit desperate for connection, without really acknowledging it to myself until just recently. And I made the mistake of acknowledging it to her while I was anxious and depressed and concerned about it in the first place, which was revealing and probably insightful, but seemed to drag us down a little further. 
 I think perhaps I've waited a little too long to give her space, to let her define the level of the relationship, and have really not focused on living my life as much as I should have. All of this was compelled by making sure she was living hers to the happiest degree. 
 I don't want to overstress the relationship any longer. My dream would be that we would fall in love again someday, but I'm not holding my breath. My ideal situation would be that we could exist on a wavelength that was really comfortable to both of us, and I'd like to give her the opportunity to help me to define that. 
 I've lost a little confidence that it's possible to break it open to suggest that between us. I feel like our history together has led us to always be especially accommodating to each other, but she's been doing it for me for so long, in responding to my gestures and initiatives, that it nearly feels like she does it almost as a force of habit these days. 
 I don't want that. If we're friends, I want it to be mutual, you know? And suggesting that it's not mutual right now only brings a ""what are you talking about?"" Though I think she knows precisely what I'm talking about, I know she does it for me because she'd like to match me out of love for who I am -- but it's not clear that it's because she truly wants to. 
 
 I want to be courageous and do the right thing for us. I'd like to make it better, but I don't want it to be simply my dreams that lead my actions, though they do inspire them. I think I've been dreaming about her, though, and she hasn't been dreaming about me. I want to do this ideally. For me, and for her. For us too. I'd like to have a close friendship. We do still seem to have one, of course, but I'd like it to be better. I've started to step away a little bit, reassuring her that I'm here to talk as she feels like she'd like to. 
 I need some more thoughts on my situation. 
 Like I said, I can describe the backstory if it would help, and I'd be happy to answer any inquisitive questions that would help you better understand our situation. I have a feeling this is kind of a universal thing within relationships, though.","I've always been a source of energy and optimism for the relationship. The inspiration has waned a little from her side, and I'd very much like to re-settle the relationship to a more optimal level for her while I get back to working on myself. I know it's a tightrope, but is it possible for me (us) to step back some without having to call it quits?

"My credentials: 2nd year into college as a psychology major (probably a criminal justice minor) studying at Oakland University in Michigan. 
 From what I know watching ctfxc for about 5-6 months now and doing my research on what I missed in their life. I would say it is more Alli's side on breaking up and that she is having a quarter life crisis. (Which is not at all a bad thing, people make mistakes, deal with it) 
 She like everyone else wanted to marry the man of her dreams. She thought she could take care of Charles in sickness but that took a big toll out of her ""youth"". Also being 3 years into the marriage is not that long of a time. For many people marriage has more financial meaning rather then being husband and wife. People go decades without getting married because they don't need or don't feel like they need that title. 
 Not being able to get drunk seems like a petty thing but in my personal experience would hate to date someone who got drunk even on the weekends seeing how I am still 20 years old. So to each their own. I am sure Charles wanted her to be happy but at the same time, didn't want to have to deal with a drunk wife and that is only a minor detail to the whole picture. 
 The trips do seem strange but I think that was Alli's way of ""getting payback"" from Charles being gone with the band. Even though that might not seem like payback, it's all about perception. I can bet that at first Charles didn't think anything of it but after Japan decided that she had an underlying motive to it. And who knows maybe Alli told him straight up before she left. 
 Chico is something I could not see coming. The only logical reason that she would keep him if they knew that they were going to break up before that. Or who knows maybe Chico was the breaking point. Charles didn't want or ""couldn't afford"" another dog and Alli wanted him. Again all speculation for when the camera turns off. 
 I could go on and on but reality is we know what we know and it's not really our business to ""hold them hostage"" to tell us what really was going on. If they want to tell us in the future fine, good for them for having the balls to do that. But don't expect a confession video anytime soon. It's their life and they don't have to explain their private life to the world.",Read people it's good for you.,20,M,CTFxC
"My boyfriend [20M] and I [17F] have been together for more than a year. Since we did meet online, I didn't bother to tell my parents about him. Once we realized we wanted to make it more serious, he visited me here. Naturally, I told my parents. Things did not go well. 
 They accused him of trying to rape, murder, and do all sorts of things to me. Which I kind of expected, but the accusations never seem to end, even after they've met him. 
 I figured that since he's my first serious boyfriend, I'd be able to talk about him with my mom (since we don't really talk about anything else). NOPE. She hates him. She tells me straight up to break up with him and to find somebody closer. 
 She tells me we don't have a future together because he doesn't have a high school diploma (he's going back to get it when I'm in 2nd semester). Where he lives, he has to take French all 4 years of high school to graduate, and he failed grade 12 French 3 times. She also says she doesn't like him, yet counters arguments saying she doesn't know him enough. 
 She's also completely paranoid about his parents. If I happen to mention them, she says, ""If they're even his parents."" She also refuses to call them/search them up to see if their last name matches up with their address. I have him, his dad, and his sister on Facebook and as far as I'm concerned they're all realistic accounts. 
 I plan on going to university in his city (so a 6 hour car ride away from home, w00t) and my mom said she'd ""think about it"" which pretty much means ""I'm going to let you get your hopes up and then crush them."" She also said that if in the future we decided to get married that she'd be completely against it. 
 I know I got myself into the LDR, but I hate dealing with the pain of him leaving after visits alone. My parents said that it was ""my problem"" and that they had nothing to do with it. 
 I know that honesty is best, but I have told my boyfriend what my parents said about him and I seriously regret it. It's strained our relationship, yet the thought of breaking up with him is out of the question. If I had to choose between my parents and him, it'd be him (from past issues - physical/emotional abuse). 
 He was supposed to visit this weekend, but the hotel/train tickets would have maxed out his credit card and been over the daily withdrawal amount on his debit card. I had also asked if he could stay the weekend instead of paying for a hotel and they were obviously completely against it. There is also no way in hell that I'm going there either (if I did, they said my home life would change - which means no cell phone, internet, etc.) 
 On a side note (I figured making another post was pointless), we were considering getting a promise ring, making a promise that no matter what we wouldn't let anything come between us. I do understand that things do happen and we could be split apart, but it would make everything (me going there for university) feel more real, especially since it's a LDR. Thoughts on this? 
 If any of you have any ideas on how I could make my parents understand a bit more, it would be greatly appreciated! [:","Parents are being super unsupportive of my LDR and are making it really difficult (more than it already is). Any ideas on how to make them more supportive?

"So, 2 years ago I was talking to this girl who I had a huge crush on, we were flirting for a few months and then I notice that she is showing signs that she likes me the same way I like her, more than a friend, I ignored these signs though thinking she was just like that and couldn't help it. 1 year later I decided I couldn't handle it no longer and decided that I was going to tell her that I had a huge crush on her in a few days time. The day I decided to tell her, she had something to tell me, so I let her go first, I remember her words, she said ""I used to really like you, and I wish you noticed that"" so I replied with ""I did notice, I have had a huge crush on you for so long"" then she said ""If only you told me when you first started having a crush on me, we could of been a thing"" so I was all like ""Ye well I didn't, we still can be a thing though?"" then she says ""No, I'm with someone now, you kept me waiting too long, also we cant be friends, that would just be awkward"" this is where the fuckup is; I got hungry after the conversation we had, so I went to McDonalds, to order my usual, a McChicken, but alas, they had just served the last McChicken.

"I'll admit before going into this 50% of this post is wanting to read other peoples life stories and the other 50% is wanting to tell mine, so here goes. 
 When I was 12 my mother told me, 5 days before we moved, we were moving in with her boyfriend, a man whom I'd never met however I did know his daughter who used to babysit myself and my younger brother, apparently he cheated on his wife with my mother.
Upon moving in I obviously had problems with this arrangement, being something of an introvert a sudden change like this and living with a stranger messed with my head and I would get into arguments with him. My mother thought it would be a good idea if I visited my dad for the long weekend of my 13th birthday, he lived 250miles away in London. The day before my birthday she texted my dad the following ""Don't bother bringing him back"" and took my younger brother and her boyfriend to Spain for a ""family"" holiday that we had been planning for the last 3 years (I say planning, I was 12, she said it was happening next year 3 times) I haven't seen her or my brother since. 
 This in conjunction with getting bullied at my new school led me into a spiral of depression, being expelled from school for arguing with a receptionist at 14 and never attending another school, multiple suicide attempts over the years and my father having to quit his job to take care of a kid he didn't want and was not prepared to have to care for.

 Goals for this meet (in 220 class): 
 
 Squat 405   
 Bench 275

 Squat : 
This should be pretty easy. Going to continue to run 5/3/1 because it worked last time, and test my max in 1.5 months; if I don't feel confident that I could hit 405, I will run the Texas Method for 2-4 weeks, as it's what got my squat up past 315 to 365 in a short period of time. 
 Bench : 
The bench is where I need help. 22 pounds in 3 months is reasonably achievable, but I have a couple problems: 
 
 5/3/1 didn't do jack shit for my bench   
 Texas Method didn't do jack shit for my bench 
I don't want to do Smolov Jr. 4 days per week of benching is likely much more than I need to improve, and I also want to be able to push my other lifts at the same time (I also like my rotator cuffs). I'm looking for something a little less extreme - something that can be run 1-2 days a week. All I ever see recommended is Smolov Jr, and I'm looking for something more like Mag/Ort for bench.   
 
 Dead : 
Going to run Mag/Ort for deadlift. Seems like the most optimal program because I need practice with the lift and medium volume/1 day a week has worked in the past. I'm also going to use some of these sessions to practice my mixed grip, because I have never really used it, and will probably see huge gains from not doing DOH. Near the end of the program I will also switch to Sumo, because it is my stronger stance, but I get stronger by pulling conventional.","Question 
 
 Are there any bench-specific programs where you're benching 1-2x per week with moderate/high volume (that I could run alongside Mag/Ort)? Enough volume to practice the lift and gain strength, less volume than Smolov Jr. I will probably do this program for the 3 months up until the meet.",21,M,weightroom
"First off, save your bashing. I know what happened wasn't right. It happened and now I want her in my life. 
 I dated this wonderful woman for just over a year when we were both very young adults 22ish. We split because of career paths and moving to different parts of the country. Still to this day it was the most intense relationship I have ever had. 
 A year or so after our split and my moving we started talking again. It started on facebook, then texting and then to long daily phone conversations. At first it was very innocent. We talked about our new lovers and lives. We had so much in common when it came to our view of the world. She married an alpha type and we stopped talking for 6 or 7 months. He became abusive physically and emotionally. So she divorced and contacted me again. We picked up right where we left off. Almost like it never happened. But, we still lived 1800 miles apart. The talking continued through both of our relationships with other people. We talked of one day living in the same area and both expressed our desire to be together. ""We are soul mates"" kind of talk. 
 After about a year of dating her newest man, he proposed. She accepted.... 
 I objected. I didn't know him personally, obviously. But, from what she told me he was a great guy and treated her right. Which was close to everything she wanted. I respected her decision and cut ties for a couple years. 
 Then it started again with her reaching out to me. Just like before it picked right back up where we left off. Hours and hours of phone conversation. Started out innocent. But, due to our strong physical and mental attraction it quickly became not so innocent. I would see her when I visited ""home"" But it never got physical on those visits. One day she called and told me she had a bachelorette party to attend in Vegas and would love it if I could meet her there. I live a ""short"" distance from Vegas. I love Vegas for a boat load of reasons besides gambling. Going was a no-brainer and a huge added bonus to see her again. Even without the sex she was my best friend. 
 The weekend arrived and I checked in. She told me she was at the pool. So down I went. When I got there I was shocked that the entire party was there. All these women were all her co-workers. Who also all work with her husband. I was introduced as an old friend and we continued the day doing what you do at a high-class vegas pool area. This was not a Rehab pool party. But relaxing, swimming, reading and moderate cocktails. It was getting a little hot and I decided I needed an air conditioned nap. So I excused myself to head back to my room. 
 Of course I was half way to my room when I got the text. Four minutes after getting to my room, the woman who should be my wife is walking into my room. I know what happened next was wrong. But, it was fucking amazing. The next few hours are quite possibly the greatest few hours of my life and I have no regrets. 
 The weekend continued like this. I did the things I do in Vegas and would bump into her group plenty. 
 I am sure you can see where this is heading. What happened in Vegas, didn't stay in Vegas. 
 A few months after the trip, the conversations stopped. All for of communication cut off, no responses to anything. One day I send her a text message saying I miss her and even as ""just friends"" I need her in my life. She replied that she is getting her second divorce and hates herself right now. I told her that I was here for her and still wanted her in my life. I always will. She replied ""Thank you"" and hasn't contacted me since. I have keep the contact to a minimum to give her space and time. An attempt a month or so. No replies. My mother who still talks to her tells me the divorce is final. 
 I am not really looking for advice. Although it would be appreciated. I just needed to share this anonymously.","Met my married ex in Vegas. Had an incredible weekend, which led to her divorce. Now she wont talk to me. I want her in my life.",22,M,relationships
"If you don't want to read all this you can get the gist of it by reading the last 2 paragraphs and the bolded bit in paragraph 3). 
 I moved around a lot when I was younger so I got used to having to integrate into new school and neighbourhood social circles and attain a close group of friends etc... It came easy to me and I never seemed to have trouble. From 15 onwards I was in the same school and this is when I grew a lot, from average height to one of the tallest. 
 Now I'm 21 I've noticed these last couple years it has been a lot harder to meet new people compared to others around me. I still have good friends from before and my problem would even present itself a lot there. We'll go out some place and meet another group. All my friends seem to instantly get along with the new group but I'd feel myself not finding it as seamless as I used to. For the next few days I'd feel slightly depressed. I felt like people didn't want to know me and they disliked me for no reason without even knowing me. It started to take its toll. 
 A couple of months ago I started really thinking about it and analysing past situations in my head trying to see where I'm going wrong. I've come to the conclusion that my height is the cause. Since then I become consciously aware of it when meeting new people and it's cleared up all the problems.  I've accepted that I have to make 100% of the initial effort when meeting new people whereas for my friends (and me when I was average height as I sprouted at around 16) it's more like 50/50 effort. 
 I have plenty of examples of how my social life is a lot healthier now. I typed up one about a work colleagues wedding I went to last week but it turned into a wall of text very quickly so I left it out. The","would have previously been shit time but instead I met a bunch of new people, including one girl who I've since been texting and meeting up with next weekend. 
 Typed up another about how my social situation in the gym has changed from being an outcast of the 'early morning gang' for 6+ months to now being good friends with all of them within a week after I realised the issue. Again, that became a wall of text. I don't want people to skip the thread because I'm interested if you guys experience the same problems. 
 I now play tennis regularly with one of the gym guys. One time when we were playing I asked ""How come we never spoke for all those months"" to which he replied, word for word, ""I don't know, you seemed like you didn't want people to talk to you ... it's probably cause you're big"".

"Well. Let me start by saying this is my first post and I'm on mobile.  Also, this is a throwaway. 
 So like most tifu's this one happened a few days ago. I'm just now posting it because things like this can only be posted on the weekend. 
 So here's some background information. I'm a young guy and still a virgin who's dating an older girl who's got some experience between the sheets. She also lives within walking distance of my place. Pretty great right? 
Now to the FU. Today she got Locked out of her place and I told her to walk over to mine. Nothing big. We went to my room and watched some tv. Things started to get intimate and I got a blow job out of it. Again, nothing big. Not the first time I've gotten one. Well a few minuets later she says to me "" I think we should take it all the way"". Well me being the virgin I am, I was extremely excited blah, blah, blah. Well I didn't even think about it but I had just blown my load and wasn't exactly feeling up to it. When I put the condom on it was  Extremely  small and maybe it cut the circulation off? Not quite sure what happened but either way...I couldn't get hard. She got extremely frustrated and then her mom came an picked her up. So now I'm sitting here in my room feeling like shit because my girlfriend wasn't pleased.","Got a bj from my girlfriend, then tried to have sex with a condom that was too small.",20,M,tifu
"So I'm a 22 year old virgin. Seriously, I think I'm pretty much the oldest virgin I know. I've had chances before to lose my virginity, but a rather conservative upbringing has held me back, thinking that it's more important to find the 'right person'. A recent discovery that my best friend had lost hers has pushed me over the edge. Now, it's 4 am in the morning, and all I can think about is how pathetic it is that I am the only virgin amongst all my friends. 
 I am currently dating a really great guy. We've been seeing each other for an entire semester and unlike previous guys I've been with, he never pushes for anything on the intimate stuff. Despite appearances, he's a lot more sensitive and thoughtful than I originally expected, which is great, except we are going SUPER slow in the bedroom. Took him a month to take my bra off, and I initiate most of the 'moving forward', which is weird because he's had more relationships than I did and was very much sexually active with his latest ex. So I guess the most logical explanation is that he just wants to make sure that I am emotionally ready since I am the virgin. 
 So yea, I did make an attempt. I am rather shy at it, and this took a lot of courage to start. We were both completely naked, and I whisper to him ""do you have a condom?"" His response ""Gave my last one away to my friend weeks ago."" Which is fine, except that was a few days ago and I still don't see any sign of a condom anywhere.
So guys, what do I do? I don't wanna be too forward and get a condom myself or anything because that might make the whole 'not want to be a virgin' thing too obvious, and I also don't want to appear to be too desperate (even though I am FRICKING desperate). 
 Is there a sly way I can talk to him about this without dumping the whole desperate thing in front of him? Ugh, any advice would be very much appreciated!!","need a way to tell my boyfriend that I MUST HAVE MY CHERRY POPPED without sounding too desperate 
 Edit:  Thanks for all the advice!  I took Morbokat's advice and talked to my boyfriend about sex.  I am literally sitting in his room right now updating this post (he stepped out for a sec).  So basically, I asked him what his thoughts are on the topic, and he said that it's not something he would pressure me into, and that it's something he would be OK without if that's what I want (sweet, right?).  Ok this is the point where it gets a bit frustrating for me.  I tell him it is something I'd be ok with, and he replies with ""I think we should wait longer.  We should get to know each other even better and one day the time will be right.""  Which, seriously sounds like something out of a chick flick.  It's really REALLY sweet, but OMGGGGGG I AMMM READY, like JESUS, FUCK!  A really dark and despicable part of my brain is just screaming ""RAPE!""  but alas, I really like this guy, and the last thing I want to do is scare him off.

"STORYTIME! 
 In the fall last year, I started eating healthier and exercise. I did cardio one day, and sit ups and a little bit of weight lifting the day after that. When I started out, I weighed 98kg (216lbs). Until Christmas, everything was going great. I think I was in the best shape of my life. I had dropped 10kg (22lbs) in 3 months. I didn't even want candy or soda. All I drank was water. I have never felt better about myself, so I had much more self confidence. I actually made eye contact with people when having a conversation. But then Christmas came. 
 My mom said something like ""You've got to eat SOME candy!"" And from nowhere, the voice that usually comes up with excuses tells me ""What the heck, how much damage can it cost?"" So in the Christmas time, I ate candies like a monster. Here's the deal with me: When I first eat candy, I eat all I can have of it. 
 Needless to say, after New Years, I had gained some pounds. Before Christmas, I weighed 88kg (194 lbs). I now weighed 91kg (200 lbs). I was kinda surprised, but thought ""This'll be easy to burn"". Well, it wasn't. I never went back to eating/drinking only healthy. I for some reason didn't do my exercise schedule anymore. And here I am. 8 months later. 95 kg (209 lbs). 
 Now, I don't blame my mom. I did at first, but I later realized there's no one else to blame other than myself. But what's the point of this post? Well. I really need to get started again. More than ever. If I get motivated, it's gone within 30 minutes. So if you guys would want to kinda sympathize with me, and give me some tips to get started, that would be awesome.","was doing great, relapsed in christmas time, haven't been able to go back",20,M,loseit
"In the early days of December, during my last year of high school. My left arm had been hurting the evening before, but I had thought nothing of it, finished my homework at 2 am and went to sleep. When I woke up and had a shower in the morning, my arm was a bit red, and still hurting. I figured I just slept on it wrong, and went about my business. On the bus to school my coat felt very tight for some reason. Still, I thought nothing of it, go to my locker, and head to my first class that morning - Chemistry! I walk in, and the first thing I hear: 
 ""Oh my god, CanadianBunny, what happened to your arm?!"" 
 I look down. My arm was red, going on purple, and swollen. I didn't hit it on anything, so major warning bells were going off in my head, especially now that the pain was getting seriously intense. And, in the face of this swollen arm of mine - I sat my big butt down, and suffered through class. I did not want to miss any notes. Plus, the  homework I had finished last night was a very minor assignment for my History class - which was next, and I was determined to hand it in myself. When I get to the classroom, I had my assignment in, and promptly break down crying, asking to see the school nurse. My parents are called, and my mom drags me to the hospital, where it was discovered I had a large blood clot in a vein in my left arm - it blocked the blood flow out of my arm, so blood pooled in my arm, and caused quite a bit of damage. 
 I didn't learn my lesson, though. I pushed through an entire day of university classes the next year when I felt a similar pain in my neck. Second clot was in my left subclavian vein, although it wasn't discovered until the next day (apparently the hospital can't be bothered to have anyone on staff in the evening who can work an ultrasound machine). I still need to thank my family doctor for that blood clot - he couldn't be bothered to pay much attention when my INR results was too low for 6+ weeks.","School > Blood clot.

"My wife and I were 14 years together, of which 9 married. We have a daughter of 8, and a son of 5. 
 From March to December 2014 I had an enormous stressful work life (being an entrepreneur) which I projected on my wife. Fights were frequent and I became very nasty toward her (not physically!). 
 In December 2014, the day after I bought a plot of land to build a new house on, she told me she wanted a divorce. My world collapsed, I lived at the office for a while and had to take anti-depressants. These pills allowed me to see my stress life, calmed me down and in march I rented my own apartment. 
 I have been living more or less normal since then. Over the summer we completed our material separation (money, house, shares, arrangement for the kids) in relative ease. I stopped taking pills in August. 
 In September we were supposed to appear before court to get a final separation. Two weeks before she mentioned the idea of following relationship therapy, which we don once 2 weeks ago. 
 We were both crying in front of the judge, which promptly judged us “not fit for divorce” . 
 We planned a diner shortly afterwards, where she told me she slept with somebody else (me too), which  caused a shock for me. The next day we met with the kids, but was still freaking out. She went home, and left me with the kids 
 I am on pills again (which calmed me down again), my wife doesn’t communicate with me outside  of the relationship therapy we are still following every two weeks. 
 She says she feels trapped in a relationship, tells me she doesn’t love me anymore, but seems unwilling to go through with the divorce. I, on the other hand, still love her. 
 This is killing me, and I don’t know what to do. 
 Any suggestions or similar stories ?","Wife wants divorce, goes to court, starts crying in front of judge, wants relationship therapy, does not try very hard, feels trapped in relationship, I don't know what to do.",45,M,relationships
"So I guess I should start with some background..... If you check my profile you will see about 4 years ago I went from 267 to about 187... past that I actually went even further to 167 (Not due to Keto actually but just calorie counting and BJJ). As seen here: 
 I have been pretty decent but lifestyle changed and I have been working from home the last 3 years. I have put on some weight and gotten to a place that I promised myself if I ever did I would go into a ""lockdown"" on my diet. I got to about 217 and knew it was time to get back into it. So I have been KCKO for about 16 days weeks and I am already back to 202 with a goal of 180-ish. 
 Now my girlfriend is also starting keto and has been on it about the same amount of time I have (2 days less), however she is already getting upset with her stalls and the fact she is not progressing as quickly as me. Ultimately, I want to support her and help her be successful without the flip side of her being resentful of my progress and wanting to quit all together. 
 So on to my questions....
I know this isn't the greatest question to ask... and there is a LOT of controversy about it... however I need to ask this especially cause some may actually have experience with it. 
 Once I hit my goal weight I do plan to go back to a somewhat carb induced diet (Somewhat). However, since my SO will still be keto'ing I plan to continue doing so with her when we have dinner and throughout the week. 
 The question is, IF (Big IF) I were to Keto 5-6 Days a week and then eat carbs on the weekends.... would I maintain, eventually go up or continue going down (ever so slowly) in weight. 
 The reason I say IF is we all know that tastes change when you Keto and chances are even on my ""Carb Heavy"" days it still won't be THAT heavy. I am just trying to figure out what is most likely to happen. 
 The other question is how can I help my SO (I don't plan to bring carbs into the house) but how else can I be supportive to ensure she is successful? (Been trying to get her on /r/xxketo) 
 Thanks!",After I reach my goal weight If I Keto 5 out of 7 days a week will I maintain or go up/down in weight?,30,M,keto
"I've been wanting to tell this story for a while, and I just wrote it in a similar thread. 
 I think this happened three years ago. I was a senior in high school who was part of the AP ""group"" for lack of a better word. The funny thing about AP classes is that all the same people are in them, so there was a close bond among all the 50/60 something kids who dared to take AP courses. 
 So anyway, there's this one girl who was in a lot of my classes. She's very smart and very athletic. Kind of nerdy. Not the greatest face, but AMAZING body, especially her boobs. I'm not really one who values a girl based on her boobs, but dude. I never really developed one of those stalk-her-on-Facebook-every-day crushes, but whenever she was in one of my classes, I found myself thinking ""I'd go on a date with her if she liked me."" 
 So this happened at the homecoming dance, senior year. I keep walking around the dance floor looking for people to ""dance"" with (basically dry-humping nowadays). I keep seeing her with her friends, and we make eye-contact EVERY time. She smiles brightly at me, I ignore it thinking she's being friendly. After all, we do have a bunch of classes together. Fast-forward to when things start winding down: people are starting to leave, but the music is still fast-paced and shitty. At this point, we've made eye contact and smiled at each other at least 10 times (I was just being nice, did not get any vibes). Suddenly, she approaches me and asks me to dance. I say yes because why the fuck not, she's hot. She presses her backside to my crotch, we hold hands, and we move our hips side to side, slowly. It's kind of awkward how slow we're dancing because of how fast the song is. She's smiling a lot. I ask why she's so happy (I still have no idea what's going on). She says, ""well it's just that I've wanted to dance with you all night."" STILL didn't hit me that she liked me––the music was just too loud and there was too much stuff going through my head at the moment. We danced for probably 20 minutes. Then I said I had to go, just because I sense shit's getting awkward. She hugs me, I feel her tits pressed up to me. I leave the dance, despite me wanting to stay and dry-hump more girls. 
 It wasn't until I got in my car and drove home that I realized she had liked me the whole time (over all of high school, that is). I didn't really know what to think––it was the first time someone had ever liked me BACK. I was so used to having crushes on girls who didn't really know me too well, or girls I had no interest in having crushes on me. I couldn't fathom how good of a situation I was in, so I started to come up with excuses for why I shouldn't ask her out. The fact that she was Christian and I was atheist was the biggest reason. But the one that bugs me the most now is that I didn't like how she was so much smarter than me. I'm kicking myself right now because of that, why did I think that??? That's something that I SHOULD be looking for! But my fucking inferiority complex couldn't let me be happy. She tried to talk to me a few more times, I brushed her off like an asshole. Fuck me.

"Ok me  (28f)  and my bf  (29m)  have been dating exclusively for over six months and previously dated for over a year 10 years ago. We've known each other for a total of 13 years and currently live together. Anyway, his ex (they broke up in Oct '11 and only dated a few months) is messaging his family and visiting his son rather frequently. (I'd also like to state he now lives in MA and she lives in CO where his son lives. He was in the military, divorced, etc). 
 I'm starting to think this chick is stalking him or something. She text messages and facebook messages his mother all the time which she rarely responds too. She's only met this girl once when the two visited from CO back in Sept '11. She hangs out with his ex-wife who allows this chick to take his son overnight. To my knowledge said ex-wife has never asked my bf is he's ok with this. 
 The last straw was a few days ago this girl texted pictures of the Colorado Springs fire and asked, ""Are you worried about your son?"" to his mother. My bf just went to Co Springs to pick up his son. He drove there and back and is keeping son for the summer. Anyway, I am just so flabbergasted that this chick would do that. This poor woman has had to worry about her son go through two tours of duty in Iraq and she didn't need to see those pictures knowing her grandson and son were there. 
 At this point I think my bf needs to intervene and tell this chick to leave him and his family alone. My bf does not talk to this girl, doesn't text her, doesn't facebook message her or anything. When he talks about her he refers to her as ""crazy"" and ""annoying"".

"It's not about whether or not you weren't doing anything wrong, it's whether or not the cop thinks you were doing anything wrong. 
 Ah, that isn't too far-fetched actually, I can attest to that first hand. 
 When I was still in high school, either a junior or a senior, I was leaving my boss' house after fixing his computer and setting up a wireless network for him. At the end of his block there was a stop sign and the road merged with another, which curved, and it was tangent to. 
 I sit stopped, waiting for a break in the cars coming around the turn. I wait until I cannot see any headlights navigating the curve, and make might right turn. 
 Out of no-where some jackass in a mustang floors it through the curve, starts beeping his horn wildly and flashes his highbeams at me. I put my pedal down to avoid him running through me, it is to the point where I have to pull over to get out of his way. 
 Next thing I see in my rearview mirror is police lights. I think to myself, good, he's gunna get this jerk. 
 Nope. 
 He just pulls in behind me. 
 The officer, a townie mind you, starts giving me crap about how I clearly didn't stop at the stop sign. Asks me who's car I had, what I was doing out, license and registration, the whole 9 yards. 
 I was in my father's car, which I told the officer. I got my license out of my wallet, slipped one of my PBA cards behind it and handed it to the officer. I explained to him that I was going to get the registration out of the glove box. When I open the glove box, a million papers and cables fall out. While I try to locate the registration info he lectures me about I had a stop sign and how I clearly blew right through it. 
 I begin to tell my side of it, which I found not only to be futile, but to be a mistake, apologizing and pointing out that I hadn't seen the headlights from the mustang, let alone his police cruiser behind it, and how he must have heard the engine on that thing rev up and almost go through me. I go on to say that if I had not seen his  ANY  headlights, let alone his, behind the curve, then I found it difficult to believe that he saw me blow the stop sign. 
 He cuts me off and says I can either hear him out here or we can let a judge decide what happened. I'm thinking to myself the logic of letting a 3rd party try to reason out what happened here is just stupid if the 2nd party couldn't even accuratly see what happened, but needless to say, I hush up. 
 He lectures me for 5 minutes, questions me what I'm doing in  his  town (which is literally like 2 miles from mine), I explain that I was at my boss/uncles house fixing his computer, yada yada. 
 He hands me back my stuff and says ""so where'd you get that?"" refering to my pba card. I politely reply that my boss owns this deli just across the road back there, and it is frequented by county cops from several precincts. Over the years I've worked there I became close with several of them and Dave.. ahem excuse me, Detective so-and-so told me to just hand that to any officer if I found myself in a situation like this. 
 He then lectures me about how it isn't a get out of jail free card, blah blah blah... but ultimately lets me on my way. I like to think of it as more he didn't actually see me do anything wrong, knew he couldn't prove it, and his dash cam would just collaborate my side of the story anyway, but who the hell knows (I tend to overthink things)","townie cop pulled me over because he  thought  I blew a stop sign but clearly could not have seen me do it, gave me shit about it, but ultimately let me go, albeit feeling a bit emasculated.",17,M,guns
"Hey Reddit, 
 I'm popping my /r/breakups cherry with this one. I figured I could use some objective advice as I'm at a fork in the road. I've heard so much mixed ""advice"" on the matter from friends and family. I know this has been a regurgitated topic in this subreddit, so please bear with my (somewhat) elaborate back story: 
 My ex-GF [23f] of last year has been attempting to establish a ""friendship"" with me [31m] recently after we ended our relationship of 7-months last December. Reasons for the break-up vary, but let's say the main reason is attributed to me not meshing well with her over-the-top, overbearing and influencing family (being that she lives at home with them) along with some other ""small"" things that were key issues for her. For me, I've always believed a relationship should be based on two people's personal connection and not based on what a family (or anyone) thinks, believes or approves of. However, she is young and does live at home with her Hispanic family. 
 Although the break-up was initially mutual, I later caved-in and attempted to rekindle because it dawned on me that we truly were good for one another and I felt that our problems were minuscule in the grander schedule of things so we could patch things up if she was open to give it another shot. She obviously felt differently and that our problems were larger than I painted them to be. After all was said and done, I still believed there was ""hope"" for us because we still care for one another at the end of the day. However, despite my attempts she said we would only run into the same problems if we started back up again and that it was not a good idea to put ourselves through it again. 
 Since then, I did what anyone would suggest and cut-off all communications with her as it seemed like it was the most logical thing to do for my own benefit. Life was getting back to normal for me. Dates came and went, but I always felt that yearning for her. There were times when we'd randomly run into each other in social settings and things were cordial and then, more recently, intimate in those random run-ins followed by scattered texts from her asking how I was, etc. By intimate, I mean dancing, signs of interest, body language etc. 
 Fast forward to yesterday... I received another text from her after my continued silent treatment asking how I was doing followed by a comment telling me she had a ""dirty dream"" about me. I jokingly brushed it aside and I proposed a coffee meet-up to catch up as it seems she did miss me, and of course, I did as well. It seemed innocent and the location seemed safe enough--so why not? That meeting was innocent up until the point where we came back to my place to chat some more. Tension was high on my end--I felt many mixed emotions. Intimate conversation ensued about our relationship. She admitted to me that she had gone on a few dates--but had not been impressed by any of them. She also seemed to still be stern on the fact that we should remain apart--however, I questioned the intimacy of our current relations (eg. the hand holding, the flirting, the touching etc) It was there where she insinuated that she might be open to a FwB thing, but only if it was something I could handle. Admittedly, our sexual relationship was nothing short of the best sex I've had in my entire life--so this was something I entertained. Kissing ensued...but that was it. 
 All of that said, reddit, I'm very aware of all the dangers of what this entails. I understand that she could potentially be using me as an emotional/physical crutch while she seeks other potential suitors. I also understand that a FwB status can sometimes work in favor of a person who does want to rekindle a relationship. But I also know in most cases, it only spells disaster for the person who has feelings. That person, of course, being me. I have entertained this notion and feel I might be up to the challenge. However, I'd be lying if I said I didn't still hold on to a ""hope"" of a rekindled relationship with her... 
 I'm sure after reading this post that some of you can pick up there is a part of me that is still attached to her. However, after last night's conversation, I feel I would rather have her in my life, than lose her completely. With that said, I would be willing to explore these options with her knowing the dangers of what this type of friendship might bring, yet having one foot out the door emotionally so-to-speak. 
 So what are some things I should seriously consider before opening this can of worms (FwB)?","My ex-gf insinuated being open to a FwB option to our ""friendship"". Despite being aware of the dangers knowing that I still harbor strong feelings her, I am considering it. What should I know before opening this can of worms?

"About 7 months ago I took LSD for the first and only time. I thought I was taking something else (long story), and was not prepared for the trip. 
 I first experienced my worst fear (hurting the people I love) as me reliving my entire life as I was dying, shot by police after I had purchased a weapon and killed everyone I care about in life. I was reliving all of the negative moments in my life juxtaposed with hallucinating that I was on the floor bleeding out, or on the operating table, and that this was the way in which I died. It was like the script from a movie about a tragedy, showing how a good person snapped and did evil things. 
 My beautiful, amazing partner found out what was happening and led me to a different place. She sat me down and had me meditate on the elements (she is a neo-paganist), and I eventually had an incredible, healing journey. There I experienced her and I as beings of light, guardians of life, as forces of good across an infinite number of universes, where we would hold different forms but always found each other. The ""universe"" loved and cared for me, and I was a good person (my greatest insecurity), in spite of making mistakes. As an aside, I experienced LSD, meditation, prayer, spellwork as ways to connect between these infinite universes. It was a beautiful, healing journey. 
 In the past months since this event, I've had occasional moments when the emotion/feeling/experience returns to me. I have some of the good emotion from feeling like a good person, but much more than that I've been feeling more and more fear that what I experience on a daily basis is simply me reflecting upon my death. 
 In those moments, I seem to lose sense of reality. I think it is a beautiful thing to have experienced something beyond this plane of existence, whether it actually exists or not, so long as I keep my grip on my life today (as I like my life today). But in these moments my life today doesn't seem to matter. I liken it to someone who has experienced God, but unlike most people who have that experience in these moments I lose my own sense of morality or caring about what happens in this life. 
 I'm having a growing sense of dread that either what I experienced on LSD was true, about the doing bad things & dying, or that this world is all an illusion of some kind; such as one of an infinite number of simulations running simultaneously. This sense of dread is cropping up even when I don't have these ""flashbacks"" as I call them. My mind keeps connecting dots that shouldn't be connected, like the fact that movies like ""Vanilla Sky"" and ""I Heart Huckabees"" exist to show me that this world doesn't matter. 
 This doesn't happen all the time, but it seems to be happening with more frequency and lasting longer these days. I do have a psychotherapist who I have explored this a bit with, and plan to continue to do so (as I really fear what this means for me), but I am reaching out to this community for help. 
 Are there any resources I can turn to while going through this? Are there any medical professionals who exist to try and help address this specific situation? I don't know if my therapist has experience treating someone suffering from something triggered by LSD, and I am very fearful that this is what's going on. 
 As an aside, I'm 41, so I don't think it's latent schizophrenia brought out by the experience, given that most people present much, much earlier.

If they go to rehab, one of two ambulance companies will be asked to come and pick up the patients and drive them to rehab. Two EMTs with a stretcher typically come. 
 Back in June of 2014 I had just graduated from nursing school and was still working as a nursing aid (pending taking/passing my board exam). I knew the drill at this point. I was running around like a crazy person like I always did as an aid making sure all my patients were okay. When an EMT company comes to pick one of them up usually I am thrilled I have to take care of one less person and don’t even have the time to see them off. But on this particular day the stars aligned and nobody needed my help and a handsome EMT walked in and I started talking to him and the whole world kind of faded around me. It was ridiculous. It hit me like a ton of bricks. Never in my entire life had I experienced that kind of chemistry with someone. It was palpable. I couldn’t think of anything else. 
 So I found out that he was a hockey player, that he wants to be a PA, and that he is 27 (I liked this because boys my age suck and I am always told to maybe look at an older/more mature group). I was beside myself. He started dropping hints about taking me out, naming bars nearby, and telling me that when I passed my boards he would by me a drink. He ended up asking for my number (right in front of the patient). They packed her in the ambulance and left. 
 Three hours later he started texting me. There was no doubt in my mind that he was super interested. He was telling me that he wanted to take me out, to hurry up and pass my boards so that he could buy me a drink. When I told him it would be another month he said “Yeah, I’m not waiting that long. Are you free this weekend?”. And I was just beside myself. We made tentative plans for Saturday night (this all happened on a Thursday) and I didn’t hear from him again. I texted him the following day just asking if that plan was solid and he never answered. I started to worry. 
 Over the next week I was beside myself. People at work were asking about this EMT and what happened and were so surprised he had fallen off the face of the earth. I was thinking about it 24/7 hoping to hear from him. I tried to find a Facebook, anything. And he was nowhere to be found. I just found some hockey stats from college. I didn’t understand! 
 A week later I finally decided to text him. I said “So, what happened? I’m confused.” And he answered almost immediately. I got three separate texts, each one more hurtful than the last. 
 “I know, I’m so sorry”
“I don’t know what to say, I was obviously very attracted to you I just felt like a jerk because I am kind of seeing someone else and didn’t know what to do”
“But we were just two adults socializing, right? Harmless flirting”. 
 I cried almost immediately. I felt so terrible. I was so hurt and it might sound stupid because our encounter was so brief but I just couldn’t get him out of my head. I thought of things to say. But I ended up never texting him back. I felt like silence said everything to him. He wasn’t choosing me, so what was the point? I’m not going to lie, I cried for a few weeks over him. I felt kind of depressed. I had never experienced something so strongly in my life. Sigh. 
 Anyways, the reason why I am telling you this story is because I obviously still think about him. I compare guys to him. When I don’t sense that chemistry I felt with this boy I don’t feel like it’s right. I really wanted to go on that date. I really wanted to get to know him. Even though he did that to me and it really hurt, I still think about him so much. Its gotten better, but ultimately, I think about texting him all the time. 
 I guess what I am trying to figure out is, would it be totally insane to text him? Ive deleted him from my iphone but for some reason his number still shows up. He just won’t go away, haha. I guess what I would say is something like “You still cross my mind from time to time. I hope you’re well”. There is just something inside me that doesn’t feel like we are done. I don’t have closure. I don’t know what to do. Should I open that line of communication again? For peace of mind? For something? Help. And thanks for reading.","I had a brief encounter with a boy and had the most insane chemistry of my life.

"Made a throwaway and got out of bed, just for this question. Didn't get as far as sex, but my god I had so many opportunities to do it, it baffles me how I didn't... 
 I'm in my early 20's and my mate and I have been friends since around age 10 or so. He has a younger sister who at the moment is 18. I once spoke to him about sisters and he mentioned how he couldn't handle it if one of his friend's was with his sister. Anyway, went over his house a few times as a kid and never clicked that his sister was paying a lot of attention to me. 
 Skip forward a few years and our families and a few others were spending time together on holidays and this was the first time I noticed her and started to realize there was some chemistry there. 
 Skip forward again, high school. She started when I was in year 9 or 10 or something and we became pretty good friends as we would see each other pretty often, even with the age gap. After a while she started to make it blatantly obvious she was interested in me but I never really pursued it because it would have been super weird at school so I just stuck with flirting. VERY STRONG FLIRTING. 
 Once I finished high school we kept in touch through facebook and after a year or so she invited me over to watch movies. Now at this time, she had a boyfriend and I don't know what the fuck I was thinking when I agreed to be alone in a house with my mates little sister when she had a boyfriend. So I drive over there and we hang out in the lounge room for a while, then I'm laying on her bed while she is getting changed in the bathroom, we head back downstairs to the lounge room, didn't even end up putting on a movie as we had heaps of catching up to do and we were just talking for ages. Naturally, like all our conversations we ever have, the topic moves onto our relationship and our past and whatnot. Feelings are going off like fireworks and we're getting pretty close on the couch. BAM her phone rings and I'm thinking to myself ""FUCK I SHOULDN'T""T BE HERE"". Problem is, I'm still a virgin and I've got this beautiful girl who i know would have no problem in taking this further right now. Anyway while she's on the phone we're still sitting practically on top of one another and my mind is just playing chess with my penis, and it's not like a chilled out relaxing game of chess. IT'S FUCKING WIZARD'S CHESS. 
 She hangs up the phone and we talk a bit more, meanwhile the chess game is still in full swing. Conversation is rapidly getting closer to the NSFW side of things when my brain declares ""CHECKMATE"" on my penis, I snap the fuck out of it and tell her I've got to go home because I've gotta be up early for work, she pleaded with me to stay longer and in my head I hear my penis yelling out ""Best out of three?!?!"". But somehow I managed to stay strong, kissed her goodnight and drove home. 
 Back home I was calling myself a pussy for not doing it but now I look back on it I am unbelievably proud of myself. 
A: She had a boyfriend at the time.
B: It's my mate's little sister. And he told me he was against it. 
 I still talk to her occasionally and we did speak about that night. I'm happy how it turned out, I'm glad I had the strength to not cheat with her on her boyfriend. I thought how shit I would feel if I was him.

"Background: 37 weeks, 5 days...second child 
 Started having strong contractions 3.5-4.5 minutes apart on Thursday afternoon. I've had Braxton Hicks since I was 24 weeks, so I did what I could to make these ones go away - tried resting on the couch, drank at least 80+ oz. of water that day, no luck. Call doc after a few hours of this and they suggest I go into L&D. 
 At my dr. appt the day before my doc said I was high and closed. At the hospital, the nurse said I was 1cm, 50%, and -2. Walk around the floor for an hour and I went up to almost 2cm. Still contracting regularly, but not enough progress to stay (even after several laps of the L&D floor). The nurses were convinced I'd be back this weekend for sure. 
 Visited the doctor on Friday afternoon (since these dang contractions won't subside at all!) and I'm still at 1.5, but now 80%. He said my contractions are not a reliable way to tell if I should go into the hospital again. So...now I have to wait until I can't walk/talk through them or my water breaks. 
 Here I am on Sunday afternoon...still contracting and waiting. I am perfectly happy waiting until at least the 39 week mark, only if these contractions would GTFO for a while and let me be. :)",Scumbag body making me think I'm in labor when I'm not.,37,F,BabyBumps
"Today I went in for a consultation with my OBGYN to talk about getting an IUD. I've been on the pill for over a year and a half (I've actually been on 4 different pills because I've had to change due to side effects). The pill has made me VERY depressed at times and I'm  just done with it really. 
Also, as a little background, I'm 18 and in a committed relationship that I don't really see ending, I definitely want kids in the future, just not for another 8 years or so at least. 
Going in, I was sold on getting an IUD, I never even considered getting nexplanon, but my doc said I should either go with Nexplanon or Skyla and looking at both now, I dont know which one I should get! 
 My concerns about Skyla are:
-the safety of it (I know complications are rare, but they're still scary)
-the insertion is painful, and there's a possibility of it expelling which would suck
BUT, I like that the hormones are a lot lower and that since the hormones are localized in my uterus, there's a much lower chance of depression. 
 My concerns with Implanon are 
 
 weird perpetual bleeding along with an irregular period 
 there's more of a chance of emotional side effects (I might be wrong but that's my understanding so far) 
I like that the insertion is easier and its less risky.  
 
 I know that I won't know for sure how one or the other will effect me until I try, but I still want to ask around.","18 years old, need help deciding whether to get implanon or skyla.",18,F,birthcontrol
"This happened years ago when I was in the 5th grade (I'm 26 now). In 5th grade at my school, you have one teacher for the whole day.  This teacher teaches all the subjects. Everyone hated this particular teacher because she was this super mean elderly woman, who looked like she gave up on life and decided to make everyone else's hell as well. 
 Now to the fuck up.  Well my parents were pretty lenient and let me watch the South Park movie.  The next day we were in class and the teacher keeps calling on me, to answer questions, because I originally wasn't paying attention.  Well this started to embarrass/piss me off.  Finally she calls on me again, and here is what happened next: 
 Her: HandiesANDCandies88 what is the answer to the problem?
Me: Uhhh...I don't know
Her: Well, why don't you pay a little more attention.
Me: Well why don't you go suck some donkey balls.
Whole class just stared at me, their little developing brains trying to conceive what I just said.
After a second (felt like 10 minutes) of silence, she quickly took me to the principals office.  My parents were called but not told the reason, just that I was in trouble.
When my parents arrived they saw me waiting, with my head hung low. In the principals office: 
 Principal: Alright, now HandiesANDCandies88 why don't you tell your parents what you said.
Me: I told Mrs. Stephenson....to...go suck donkey balls...
My dad then proceeds to bust out laughing, and is quickly silenced by my mother.  I was suspended for 2 days.  The funny part of the whole thing is that I was placed in the advanced (much harder) class because they didn't want me taking being with same teacher/same class. My grades actually improved a lot, and I scored higher on testing. I don't know if this is because I was challenged more, or because of a better teacher. I got a certificate and a talking to by the principal.

"Sorry if this is long or if there are any spelling/grammatical errors! No point in a throw away because no one knows my account name. 
 So about a year ago I [22F] went on a couple of dates with a guy, who I guess we can call D. D[25M] and I hit it off and never had a lack of things to talk about, we were definitely attracted to each other. Through talking mutual friends, I knew that he was really into me. 
 At the time I was diagnosed with clinical depression and had begun taking a SSRI, which lead to a kind of difficult emotional point and I dealt with some personal shit. I have since healed and resolved all of it. 
 Basically what happened is I'm an idiot and socially awkward I just completely cold shouldered him after our second date. I just stopped answering our text conversation and that was that. I don't know if it was because I was scared of intimacy at the time or embarrassed about my mental health issue at the time. 
 We continue to like each others posts on Facebook and such, and have talked maybe once or twice in passing, but other than that nothing else. We live in a smallish city so it's common to see people fairly regularly.

"I'm 18 [M].
Also, this is in Ontario.
So about 6 weeks ago, I had gone to visit my girlfriend [18F] for her homecoming weekend at her university. We had plans to stay together and all the goodies. I had originally booked out a hotel room to spend the whole weekend with her, exploring the town and kind of just spending quality time together. 
 I arrived in the morning and caught up with her on her campus with all my baggage and picked up hers as well. Later that night she had an ""initiation"" party from one of the stupid clubs she had joined on campus. I, being the normally overprotective alpha male wanted to be lenient and wanted this weekend to be perfect, so I let her go for the night, and we both expected her to be back before late. 
 Then it was late. I was pacing around our room just waiting for her to text back. And it wasn't getting any less late. So, I started to panic and freak. I, being a teenager texted her a couple of times wondering where she was, if she'd be coming back, etc. 
 She finally texts me back and says that some things happened and she'll be heading back soon. Getting the text back relieved me but the ""things happened"" weren't exactly words I had wanted to hear. 
 So I text her more she texts back and she stays even later and even later and even later till the point that it gets beyond ridiculous and I call her and we have a little argument over the phone. She takes a cab back to campus with her friend(s) and I meet her there. 
 Now she's retrieving her backpack from her dorm room and I'm waiting outside, pacing, flustered. And basically she came down and I finally got to see her. She blurts out that she may have done some things that I wouldn't have liked and she may or may not have been flirting/drinking at the party and the likes. 
 That's when I snapped and began to yell at her. She argued back for a bit and began to cry and I was throwing out all kinds of issues. You already know how a basic, common teenage argument goes, right? 
She walks away and I turn her back toward me and tell her:
""Hey, listen to me, talk to me, what happened?""
And she refused to talk any more about it and argued back at me.
She turned away again and this time I had taken her arm and turned her back again, and told her to stop walking away. 
 Then this rather older woman came and started bitching at me. She told me to ""get my hands off of her"" and to ""back off"". I was already angry and throwing up steam and the last thing I needed was another person telling me to not to argue with my girlfriend. That, leaded to myself leaning the yelling toward the new stranger and at this point in time, she threatened to call the police. I called her bluff and it turns out that she wasn't bluffing. She called the cops and from that point on my girlfriend was huddled up in my arms where I assumed she just didn't wanna deal with anything anymore and wanted to go home. I agreed, but in time the cops arrived.
They questioned my girlfriend and she told them that we were getting ready to go home and didn't want them to take me in.
The stranger blatantly bitched at the popo telling them that I was pushing and shoving my girlfriend around and practically dropkicking her in the chest for all that I knew. 
They came up to me and without question they took me to their cruiser and arrested me. My girlfriend was horrified and told them not to and landed a kiss before I was taken away. 
 Basically I was told that I was being charged with domestic assault and was being taken in. I spent the night in a cell just freaking out cause well, I've never really been in jail. 
 The same night I talked to an officer during interrogation and I had told him that I did touch my girlfriend but in no way had any intention of hurting her in any way shape or form.
He agreed that she seemed very worried and that we both love each other very dearly.
I was shoved back in a cell and later released with conditions being 
 
 I'm not allowed to talk to my girlfriend directly or indirectly in any way until my hearing is over. 
 I'm not allowed to be within 25m of her. 
 I'm not allowed to be on her campus for the rest of the year. 
 I had to appear on court without exception on November 7th. 
 
 I'm in actual really good terms with her family so I got to talk to them and they had told me my girlfriend is safe and doing just fine. She's worried shitless about me and I can't help but worry about her even more. Her dad had told me they had gone to see Victim Services and the lady there told them that the prosecutor plans on using my ""confession of touching her"" against me. They had begged the prosecutor to drop charges/not really prosecute me because nobody really wanted anything against me and everything was a misunderstanding. Her father also told me that I was supposed to receive a package telling me that I had a choice to plead guilty, and have all the charges dropped. The catch was that I had to attend an anger management class once per week for 16 weeks, and I'd have a record stating that I did so. The good part about it is that I avoid a criminal record. 
 Now I have a choice to either appeal when I go to my hearing,
Or to take the offer and plead guilty, attend classes for 4 months. 
 And so, I'm here at home freaking out.
I don't know what to do and/or expect when I go in.

"Hello, r/relationships, I'll lay out the characters for you. 
 My mother [47 F], ""Cait,"" works for her long time friend and boss, ""Danny"", [52 M] whom I [23 M] also happens to be a good friend of mine and what I would consider a father figure. 
 Danny owns the company that my mother works for and she's basically his right hand; albeit, the company is quite small. It's a decoration company of sorts. It is well known in the city and outlying cities as he has worked hard for the last 25 years to get that status. He takes contracts from multiple clients and companies that can range up to a few thousand dollar jobs. 
 One of his most valuable vendors happens to be the city's major sports team. They will go to the stadium and deck the place out every game. When the finals come and if our team is still in it, every game turns into a major paycheck for the company. 
 Out of the blue a few months ago, Danny stopped getting calls from Sports Team. Very strange and alarming because they're a regular. I don't know the details about that or what was said and done, all I know is that he found out my mother has been taking those contracts behind his back and doing the work with his supplies, his paid labor, and taking the check for herself. 
 Normally, Danny would have already addressed the situation immediately. We've talked it over a few times on what to say and how to do it. I'm all for Danny as what my mother is doing is wrong. I love her but she's screwing him over when he's nothing but nice to her. He's given her advanced pay, helped out with bills, everything. The reason he hasn't engaged it yet is because my mom is sort of unstable. 
 I'm diagnosed Bipolar II and I know that stuff can run in the family. I can't speak for my mother as I don't know if she's ever been diagnosed and I'm not one to do so but I think there is something wrong with her. Anytime a situation arises where she becomes the center of it and it happens to be a conflict, she freaks out. Majorly. To the point where she thinks she's accused of being a liar and manipulator. She'll say stuff like, ""Oh, well guess you don't need me, huh? I'm just some crappy person."" 
 It's obviously a problem. It's part of the reason I moved out and into Danny's (he lives in a duplex). but also so I'd be closer to Uni. I don't live with Danny now. Instead, I live with an ex-girlfriend and her family (we get along fairly well and I think her mother loves me more...). My mother tells me I'm always welcome back to her place and that I should move in but I can't see myself living with her again and neither can my ex-girlfriends mother. Even she notices how it wouldn't be good for me. 
 Anyway, Danny and I both know the moment we bring it up that nothing good will come out of it so we're really not sure what to do. I want Danny to get his money and contract back. I want my mother to come clean and pay Danny back. Danny still wants her to be a friend and worker as I said before the company is very small (five to nine employees with Danny and my mother included) and she knows the ins and outs very well. 
 That's the gist of it. I would love to know what y'all think and how we may address the situation. I don't expect everyone to come out happy in this but I at least want it to be sorted out.

"This is certainly something that you've all probably heard before, but I'm young and foolish and could use some help. 
 Over the last few months, I've been coming out as bisexual to most of my close friends, all of whom have been very accepting and supportive. One such friend is a guy I've known since I was seven years old. We have been very close friends for many years, and as of circa 2010, I have been crushing on him non-stop. 
 Up until a few months ago, I was nearly convinced that he was attracted to men. He flirts with just about everybody and has grabbed my ass more times than I can count. However, every time I've asked him about his sexuality, he gives me either ambiguous answers or out-and-out tells me he's straight. It's infuriating. 
 I know him through a couple of organizations that demand teamwork. If we  were  to start dating, the possibility of a break-up would damage not only our friendship of nearly ten years, but would also be a detriment to these organizations, since it could potentially make functioning as a team difficult. 
 About a month ago, I confessed my attraction to him. I had been acting very overly-sexual the whole evening, and he said he thought that it was annoying, but knew that it was okay because I wasn't serious. I made things pretty awkward by telling him that I've been crushing on him for over two years. I left shortly thereafter. We have seen each other a lot since then and have been getting on pretty well, but haven't spoken about the occasion. 
 A little more background for all of you experts to use when solving this troubling case: Even though he's been very supportive of me, he jokingly asked at one point if he could use the word ""faggot"", to which I jokingly responded, ""only when I'm acting like one."" Since then, it has become his pet word, and I must confess, I'm not as tolerant of it as I thought. I told him that he needs to stop, and he has, for the most part, but he will slip up and say it every now and again. Furthermore, even though he claims that he is uncomfortable in situations that he deems as ""too gay"", he still flirts with just about everyone, even men. 
 I guess what I want to know is what I should do. I'm 90 percent sure that he's straight, at this point, and if he isn't, would a relationship be in my best interest? And if we're going to stay friends, there are some things we need to talk about.","Crushing on one of my best friends, can't tell if he's straight.

"A little bit of background information: 
 My girlfriend, Nicole (23F) and I (23M) met during our undergrad two years ago. I graduated a year ahead of her, and I moved to a fairly large city (population of about 1 million) straight out of college. We were long distance, a ten hour drive apart for one year, and she moved in with me last year. 
 I was hired as a full time employee at my current company, while also enrolling in grad school in my field. Nicole moved in with me after she graduated, taking a gap year to apply to grad school. Knowing I would have two years of experience and an advanced degree under my belt, I was fairly confident I'd find work regardless of where she decided to go for grad school. The idea was: she follows me and applies to grad school, I get my degree, and then I follow her and find work where she moves. 
 Most of the places she applied to were fairly large cities with plenty of job opportunities for me as well, but she has decided to enroll at a school in a city with a much smaller population (<70,000). I don't resent her for it as it was a good choice considering financial aid, cost of tuition, and cost of living.  This college town is located approximately an hour and a half away from where we currently live.  I am concerned about my job prospects and have been preparing myself mentally for the worst case scenario: what if I have to find work in the larger city? It is too long of a distance for me to comfortably commute, but it would also break Nicole's heart to [potentially] relocate closer to the larger city. We are moving in two months. 
 I've considered splitting the difference and mentioned it (albeit in a hasty, anxious way) to Nicole and she said that moving somewhere in-between as non-negotiable. She moved here for me, and I need to move there for her; this was the plan. Also, I wouldn't want to make her commute forty minutes to class and for me to commute forty minutes to work. 
 I'm currently looking for available positions and applying. This is the rough plan I have come up with: 
 
 Try my damn hardest to look for work  in the new city  for the next few months. 
 If I have to, find a retail position to make ends meet while I look for a more permanent position within a ~20 mile radius of the new city. 
 Give it three months of living together and if I still can't find permanent work in my field, relocate closer to the larger city and visit Nicole on the weekends 
 
 I keep telling myself that I'm overthinking it or that I am sounding the alarms early, but I'm just worried because most housing leases are for a year. If I have to move out closer to the city, we'll be semi-long distance again and she may not be able to pay for rent by herself. I'd probably help her out with it if I had to. 
 Does my rough plan sound like an okay idea? I know mentioning the idea of us living apart again would probably break her heart and come off as a little paranoid on my part, but how could I approach this conversation/should I even have this conversation?

"Hi Ladies, I'm really hoping you can help me. 
 I have been on birth control pills (on and off, several different brands) since I was 17. I am now 25. The very first pill I was on made me extremely nauseous - to the point where I was throwing up regularly. My doctor (a man) at the time told me ""Nothing I can do, the pill makes your body mimic pregnancy... so if you ever get pregnant, you're going to be one sick little person!"". I eventually found out taking the pill earlier in the day and with food made the symptoms less debilitating, but still regularly felt very nauseous and often threw up - especially when starting a new pack. 
 I moved away for university and started seeing one of the doctors in the university clinic. She was a lot nicer and switched my BC prescription... but still, the pill made me sick to my stomach. So I tried another brand. Same thing. 
 After this, I decided to stop taking the pill altogether (rough breakup, decided to be alone for a while)... so I was off the pill and completely abstinent from sex for the next year. And then something scary happened - my periods started getting heavier and heavier. They had always been pretty heavy, but now they were getting more painful as well - pain so severe I would be curled up in the fetal position for hours on end, the worst lasting two days. This was about the time I started getting two periods a month, and then finally -- my period for 5 weeks straight. 
 I ended up going to the emergency clinic one morning when the pain was really severe and the doctor told me it was most likely endometriosis and gave me some pain killers. 
 I went back to the nice lady university doctor and she told me I should go back on the birth control pills both to regulate my periods and to reduce the chance of causing scarring on my uterus from the endometriosis - I guess being on the pill makes the tissues less inflamed, which leads to less/less chance of scarring? 
 So finally she put me on the pill I am on now - Alysena (the knockoff of Alesse, I believe?). Somewhere in the middle of all this I met my SO. He is wonderful and has been so understanding through all of this, but he's a guy and he has needs. This is not just for him, though - I have needs too, I don't want a sexless relationship. 
 I am happy to say that my current pill does not give me any of the nausea or vomiting I was experiencing with the other pills - but its side effects are almost worse. I have no sex drive. Absolutely none. I have zero desire to have sex with my wonderful boyfriend. I wish I wanted it, but I just don't. I know it is the pill causing this - when my SO and I first got together this wasn't an issue at all. And it's not that the feelings have worn off or it's just not exciting anymore... as soon as I started taking the pill, our sex life dropped right off. 
 He tries to be understanding but really if the situation was reversed I would be pretty upset so I know it's got to be getting to him. 
 Alysena is also causing me to break out with acne on my chin and chest, which I am trying to get under control via a new skincare regime... and increased hair growth (in the peach fuzz) on my chin. Those side effects I could live with, it's a good trade off for the nausea... but the lack of a sex drive I worry will kill my relationship. 
 Especially after seeing the recent post about the woman's husband who kept a spreadsheet of all the times she turned him down for sex - it got me thinking. I turned him down this morning, every night this week, I don't really remember when the last time was that we had sex. 
 Please, please help me. I need to stay on the pill to control my periods and endometriosis (and my SO has an intense dislike of condoms), but it's killed my sex drive. What do I do? 
 I have thought about getting an IUD (several of my friends have one), but the idea terrifies me - the friends who do have one have also had issues with them. 
 Should I switch my birth control pill again and risk the nausea and accompanying psychotic mood swings a new pill brings?","Feel like I have to be on BCP to control endometriosis and heavy/irregular periods.

"Backstory: 
 So I'm 29.  I've had trouble with ED to various degrees since my early 20s. 
 This whole passed year, I took viagra, none of the girls knew. 
 I just moved to a new city, I wanted a new start, no more viagra. 
 I just started seeing this girl, she's very nice, incredibly hot, and very freaky in a sex positive way.  We've fooled around a couple times, the first time I couldn't really get it up, the second time I got 3/4 erection and was able to finish during oral. 
 I'm extremely frustrated with myself, and feel like I've got to figure this ED thing out, whatever it takes.  I looked up sex therapist in my area, although I'm admittedly not ready for that.  And I have decided to try not fapping as much, and completely quitting porn. 
 Last night: 
 Last night I was about to fall asleep, wasn't really thinking about sex, and decided I wanted some relief. (It's been a week of not fapping)  My issue is more with porn than with fapping, I've been feeling a little down, and have turned down several offers from the beautiful girl I'm seeing to stay over, I figured I could use a little 'win.' 
 So I decide to go for it, fap, not looking at porn.  And it was like I had ED with myself!  This has never happened.  I found I was too much in my head thinking all these depressive thoughts.  But I kept trying, and the more I tried, the less it worked, and the more pitiful the situation. 
 Finally I give up, but then I try again, not thinking of porn, only recalling hot personal, past experiences.  But then something interesting happens...All this unhot experiences I've forgotten about start popping into my head, suddenly my entire sexual history is unfolding in my mind and I can see my ED progressing...I remember I wasn't always like this, and started seeing when it began to happen, and couldn't help but observe that was definitely when I got more heavily into porn. 
 So I'm watching my sexual-life, flash before my eyes and it's all very interesting, but not particularly stimulating, and I'm still trying to fap.  So I get my laptop out.  I resign not to look at anything I wouldn't do with the girl I'm currently with, nothing super kink, just hot couple-porn(which I never look at).  And I quickly open to a gorgeous young couple having really hot, intimate sex.  And then!  I have another revelation, this isn't really turning me on at all! Hahaha, I thought to myself WTF?!  This is more or less the motions I go through when I have sex....Something about the disconnect of what I fap to, have been fapping to for  years , and how I actually have sex....How am I even surprised I have an ED issue??!! 
 So here I am, r/nofap, trying to restart my brain.","Tried fapping, I now understand how I need to rewire my brain.",29,M,nofapgonewild
"I'm (24,M) in a long term relationship with my partner (27,F) for about 8 years. In december we're getting married. I think we're a very good couple (we have our hickups of course) and really love each other. 
 Now that we're getting married, I'd like to have some advice and insight into other relationships on how to handle the financials as a couple. 
 We both have steady jobs with a different pay. She makes about 30% more than I do and is more career oriented than I am. If i'd have to predict the future, I'd wager that this percentage will increase. 
 At the moment we have a shared bank account which we use to buy our groceries and pay bills (rent, cable,...). When we were still in college, we contributed an equal amount to this account. When we started working we contributed an amount relative to our wages are proportionate to eachother (for example, she would contribute $130USD and I $100). 
 Now that we're getting married, it seems to make more sense to just dump everything together so we don't have the annoying issues of what to pay with which bank account, settling purchases,.. On the other hand, it makes sense that you have your own account and continue as we've done before (but with a substantial bigger contribution). 
When we'd get a mortgage to buy a house things'll get even more complicated, so I'd like to get a good financial arrangement in our relationship.

"I'm on shore duty, so going into this we have a pretty relaxed shop. We're kind of under our chain of command's radar. Our chief stops by about once a week, to make sure every one's OK, but otherwise lets us do our own thing. I've been there for about a year, and am somehow now the most senior person in the shop. I'm a Third Class. Also working in the shop are two other Third Classes, who have been there less than two months, and three Seamen who have been there between 9 and 5 months. 
 So, about a month ago our Chief came by and asked if I would like an ""official"" leadership position in the shop. As it's been for the last 6 months or so, I've been writing our schedule, ordering parts, taking muster, bringing chits up the COC, and doing all the managerial type stuff along with my regular job. But, since we're all pretty much equals in the shop, my new position should really only come with a nicer eval, acknowledging the work I've been doing, and not much more. At least, that's what Chief told me. 
 When we made my position ""official"" Chief and our DivO sat us all down and told everyone that I'd be doing the usual stuff, and everyone else should do the usual stuff, but now everyone will be mustering with me (which they already did) and can come to me with any problems. I'm now the lowest level on our chain of command. 
 Now for the problem; This girl (PO3) is fairly new to the shop. She's a hard worker, and that's about all she has going for her. She is just super annoying. She talks constantly, about nothing anyone else has interest in, and doesn't seem to understand basic social interaction. We all work closely together, and her personality, while friendly, is causing a lot of petty behavior in the shop. 
 When she first got here, everyone was one the same level and we all just did our own thing. Our shop is relaxed, we chat all day and as long as work is getting done our chain of command doesn't care what else we do. When PO3 was irritating one of us, we would just kind of blow her off and it wouldn't be a big deal. No one was ever rude to her, but none of us have made an effort to make her feel welcome either. 
 Now everyone has been coming to me asking me to get her to shut up, to make her leave them alone, ect. She has gotten progressively more annoying since she joined us, and it's gotten to the point where she is interrupting others work. 
 PO3, on the other hand, has now come to me complaining that so and so made fun of her. She's not only being left out but is feeling straight up unwelcome in her own workplace. 
 So far, I have asked everyone to be respectful of each other. We had a nice group discussion about each others boundary's and about how we need to put work ahead of anything else. That only calmed everyone down for about a week, and then it was right back to the bickering and complaining. It's like everyone went from smart, responsible adults to children almost overnight. 
 I don't want to get Chief in on this if I don't have to. We all love the freedom he's given us and I want to be able to keep that. I also want to prove to myself that I can handle this leadership thing. 
 I know that saying no one can chat at all during work time would solve the problem. But, we all work hard at a mind-numbing job and a little social interaction keeps us from burning out. And, I honestly don't think I could follow that rule myself. 
 I want to talk to PO3 and explain that she's annoying and that maybe everyone would get along with her better if she shut up sometimes. I don't know how to say that professionally, though. And, I don't want it to seem like I'm using my new authority just to make her feel bad, or 'take sides'. 
 Can any of you give me an idea of how to deal with this?","I was given a leadership position in my work center about a month ago and am having trouble dealing with a shipmate who is  so annoying . I don't know how to talk to her in a way that won't be too mean but I need to make everyone get along somehow.

I think we're about due for Responsible Behavior and Stress Control anyway, so we can make a whole day of it. I will also talk to PO3 in relative private about being respectful and not interfering with others work. Throughout the day, and really all the time, if I notice her or anyone else being rude, disrespectful, or inconsiderate I'll calmly tell them that it's not OK. When Chief stops by, I'll brief him about the situation, tell him what I'd done so far, and what I plan to do. Hopefully he'll be happy with the plan.

"I don't even know how to get everything off my chest..... 
 So, I've always been a bit of an introvert I guess, I've never been to any organized hobbies, I was really shy to meet people etc etc.
When I've been in high school (or the equivalent school of ages 16-19), I've started to realize how bad my situation is. It didn't bother me as much before because ""I would change when I get older"" but that just doesn't happen. 
 Now, I have 2 really good friends, but we never hang out outside or anything, we just sit around playing video games. I'm craving for social contacts and I actually think I'm a fairly nice guy, I'm not shy at all anymore. 
I keep fucking up my classes and school in general because I'm lazy and I can't handle it. I know this might get better when I go to university, but even then I have wasted ""the memorable years"" of my life! 
 The main problem I have is my body. I adore physicality and I actually love sports, but I never get to do sports (sounds weird yeah). Even though I have a bit of muscle, I'm not content with my chest nor with my stomach. Also, my endurance is shit. It's killing me inside, especially when I look at other guys at the school. 
That brings me to the next part. I compare myself constantly to others and nothing's more depressing than being weaker/lesser than  those that are younger . I can't stand it. And when people praise some athlete or similar, the normal response would be to be happy for them, but I loathe myself because I don't have anything to be proud of.
The weird thing is, I still think I'm good looking and I'm perfectly fine with the size of my.....private parts, so that's not a problem :P 
 Ohhh, girls. Never had a girl as a friend, never had a girlfriend, never kissed a girl etc. etc. Although I have met a group of people in school who are nice, I don't know how to get into the group because they are much ""cooler"" than me (a.k.a. they actually do stuff outside of school.) 
 THE STORY FROM TODAY: I was actually really happy today. A new period started in school, and even though I have A LOT of unfinished work from the previous, it felt like my burden had been reduced. I was more confident and a couple of people from the group took a seat beside me in class and it was the best day in ages. I was sure that today I could do the missing homework and maybe take a walk or something. 
 Well, I was chilling at home and my parents came home. Fair enough, day went like always....but then came the dinner. And we don't have those family dinners mind you, it was just some microwaved chicken and stuff. 
Okay, so I'm about to go back to my room and my mother yells ""You will eat at the table!"" I don't know about you, but for an adult, it's extremely uncomfortable to do something your parents tell you, especially when it doesn't have a good reason. 
Finally I submitted and went to the table, but alas, my father shouts  how childish I am and how I must obey my parents as long as I live under their roof. Typed like this it doesn't sound like much but at that point my self-esteem completely broke (inside). It is so humiliating. I am an adult, but I'm still treated like I am 13. 
Then I argue with my mother and she starts berating me about how I just sit on the computer and how I have no life (THE FACT THAT IT IS TRUE MAKES IT WORSE). 
 I haven't worked a single day in my life and I'm actually getting worried about it. My parents keep yelling at me for that too and it just makes me feel all the more childish. 
 How COULD I go to work? How COULD I drive a car? How COULD I go to the gym. How COULD I have a girlfriend let alone have sex? It's downright  SCARY  that people my age have proper jobs, can act in porn, can have an own house and  everything! I am like a fucking weak teen. 
 I'm not even sure of my sexual orientation. I mean, I'm not gay but as I see it, my goal in life is to have fun (meaning I would totally be friends with someone like Jack Harkness from Doctor Who/Torchwood). My dream since I was old enough to understand these things was to have this romantic relationship with a girl, sneaking in their house etc. I'm not a guy who looks only after sex, I want intimacy, I want passion, I want to party. Even typing this I realize how childish I am, I'm the kind of guy who is intimidated even by younger teens than me. People probably see me as a nerdy guy (except I'm not good at school, I'm not even good at video games!) 
 I'm like a social, fit and open minded partygoer in the skin of everything that is its opposite.","I'm not good at anything, I am an 18 year old who could as well be 13, my parents are treating me the opposite of an independent adult I am craving for social and sexual contact.

"Okay, so, I am a 16 year old guy who has been home-schooled since I was nine, and I only know other Christians. My only close friends have all graduated this year, and are gone for the summer and then they'll be off to college. I have always been a very factual person, and one of my biggest aspirations is to know everything there is to know, I love history and science, and it just happens to be that those two areas are the most contradictory with what I (did,do) believe in. I've had doubts for a while, and in my small-ish youth group that has gone through many troubles lately, and I just happen to be the most trust worthy, and only reliable guy old enough to be considered an upperclassman down there, and have been given many responsibilities, and the pastor of my church has even joked about me someday in the distant future, being someone who could take over the church for the new generation. I had plans more then a year ago, when I was still very steady in my beliefs, to slowly pull out of the church and go to another one where I am close friends with the whole youth group, but due  to my inability to not be a yes man and my desperate need to please people I've done the opposite and now I have people relying on me. I've dug my self in real deep, and now I've lost my closest friend, the only person who I honestly could tell stuff and be sure that I won't lose their trust, because he is graduating.

I used to hate her but then I got her a job where I work and we became involved with each other for eight months.

"First allow me to say I am an LGBT advocate and love my daughter no matter what, NO MATTER WHAT!  Our daughter just turned 13-years-old less than a month ago, so she is still quite young for serious relationships. This summer we had to make the difficult move from Alaska to the Southwest, which has been terribly hard on her since she had to leave her best friend behind. Fortunately in this day and age with Smartphones and Skype, it doesn’t mean their connection had to be severed – good for them. As summer approached I had noticed inching up towards our move date that they were becoming inseparable; since the move it’s become WORSE. 
 At first it appeared as if they just missed each other dearly and it was a welcome comfort to aide with the isolation and hardships that come with moving/separating. Since then we’ve noticed that instead of engaging in her regular habits & activities she just wants to be on the phone. Also, it’s rarely spent nurturing other friendships; it’s almost always with her BFF. This may seem normal from the outside, a bit typical for a blossoming teenager who just left her BFF, but it’s as if they are in a constant state of conversing, just taking breaks to eat a meal, or have a moment with family; even then she tries sneaking the phone at the dinner table or in the bath. It’s become this unhealthy obsession. She’s now completely absurd with her phone/skype use, to the point where it’s become common for us to briefly suspend her phone privileges, just so she’ll do something else. Until now she’s never given me reason to read her text messages. I completely respect her privacy and only occasionally check her search history to make sure she’s not in too deep however, last night I had contemplated leaving her BFF a message letting her know our daughter was grounded from the phone since their last convo ended so abruptly. I couldn’t help but notice the text above stating “it’s called Lesbian Sex.” Curiosity and concern got my attention, so I proceeded to read a few more texts - It was shocking to say the least. What was once an innocent connection has turned into an obsession. Not only are they deeply in “love” with one another, the messages are turning very sexual. For good measure I decided to check her Skype and it gets worse. They are having “sex” with each other via Skype and it’s pretty explicit. 
 Let me remind you my daughter JUST turned thirteen and is beginning 8th grade¬¬¬¬¬¬. The relationship they are having is way too intense, not to mention I’m questioning my daughters sexual orientation; coming to terms with the fact she might be gay (which is OK). Her friend seems to be the aggressor and my daughter has totally succumbed to her advances. I don’t know what our next step should be. If it were a boy we would want it to stop, she’s waaay to young to be having any kind of “sex.” I could sever the cord completely, since there is no way she can run away to Alaska, but I don’t want her to hate me or distrust us. Also by bringing up what we know and why we are doing whatever we may do, it possibly OUTS her; something I would have expected her to do in her own time if she is indeed gay and not bi-curious. I can’t really reach out to her friend’s mom for fear this may OUT their daughter and I’m not sure of their views on homosexuality (they are quite religious). Yes, it may be self-discovery and her 1st love which we all get lost in, only the way she is behaving is unhealthy…she is no longer actively participating in her interests as she did before, or paying much attention to her other friends; Plus the explicit talk and sexual activity is too mature and inappropriate.

"Background: My [25F] biological parents divorced when I was around 7 years old, my mother left him. He then married my stepmother - they have been married for around 17 years. I currently live with them and have a biological brother [22M] who is at college away from home. 
 A year ago, I noticed she had been texting and talking to the same man on the phone everyday. I told my father about it - he thinks they're just friends, but he told me to keep an eye on her. (Background: my father works from morning to night everyday). 
 Recently, my father and stepmother had a set of twins (through IVF), they're currently 3 months old. This is when I see more of the man my stepmother is very close to - let's call him Jack. He shows up at a family lunch one day, and my stepmother introduces him to everyone. My father knows Jack is her good friend. (Jack was also visiting the twins at the NICU many times before they came home.) My stepmother tells everyone that she wants to set her older sister up with Jack. Everyone in the family believed her - except my brother and me. 
 Jack is everywhere nowadays. I see him at lunch with my family, I see him at my grandmother's home babysitting the twins, and it pisses me off. I confronted my aunt [47F] (stepmother's sister) about her being set up with him and she says she does not want to be with him at all. This is when I start investigating... 
 I went into my stepmother's Facebook messages and read her conversations with Jack. They were disgusting. There is no way they are just friends: He tells her he is horny and she talks to him about the twins as though they are his children. He tells her that ""they're the best gift you give me"". I sent the screenshots to my brother and he told me not to do anything yet. 
 What should I do now? Do I need more proof? Or should I go straight to my father?","Stepmother might be cheating, I have some proof. How do I tell my father?",25,F,relationships
"Hey all,
I've been without a bike since May 2015 and have since moved from the mid-atlantic US down south   where the weather is warmer and roads more appealing. Been craving to ride again but when I bring it up my gf, mid-20s, refuses to hear it claiming how unsafe it is and cant stand the thought of me getting hurt permanently, which I appreciate. 
 A little background on me: I'm in my later 20's and rode on/off since about 2007 on a starter honda rebel then upgraded in 2010 to a yamaha FZ8. I still rode infrequently as I kept the bike in another town but Ive taken enough backroads trips with my father out in Appalachian country to know that sport-touring is my niche and what I really enjoy. I was out with him on Mem Day Wknd following him on a backroad on what seemed to be pretty straightforward ride. I dropped back a bit to take a wide turn I saw ahead at a more aggressive speed than I probably should have, not knowing the area and all, and I come around the corner and the road about 30 feet ahead suddenly turns to gravel. I essentially did not slow enough in time and the FZ immediately bit into the gravel and tossed me a good several yards. Rode the bike home after that with a headache, sore shoulder, and wounded pride. The bike however sustained enough damage that it was totaled by insurance standards so I sold and haven't rode since. 
 I've told my gf this story, with whom I have long term plans to wed and have a family, to which she expects as well. Her father is a physician and she has heard many horror stories from him I'm sure. She is still in med school and I'm a physician myself and can still justify riding despite what I've seen come thru in the emergency room. I'm very careful, conservative rider, mostly because of the infrequency at which I used to ride, but also I ride with a full modular helmet, armored mesh jacket/pants/boots and never mix alcohol and riding, period. 
She is away in the mid-atlantic still in school but we have been keeping up well with a long distance relationship. In the meanwhile I really want to take up the hobby again. The feeling of being able to explore the countryside, the open air, and the freedom I experience are simply indescribable and I don’t think she can relate to. Has anyone had a similar situation and been able to change their SO’s mind? Is there some literature I can use to help convince her?","my gf is terrified of me getting in a motorcycle accident, I haven’t rode in a few years but have 7-8 years experience, progressed from 250 to 800cc; how can I convince her to let me ride again while she is away studying?",29,M,motorcycles

"So I'm a 24M virgin, walked away from the 4 chances I've had in the past and am essentially just waiting for the right girl (don't want her drunk, or one night stands, etc). I focused on my schooling and work during college so girls weren't a priority but now that I'm working an awesome job and obtaining numerous hobbies I'm becoming more and more social with the females being everywhere. 
 One thing I'm concerned about (along with every guy right?) is how well I perform. Everyone keeps suggesting Kegels to help with lasting longer. But I've always wondered, what exactly am I suppose to be controlling during the actual act that Kegels helps with? Even when I masturbate (I only edge on occassion since I'm participating in /r/NoFap as well. So nothing to completion, but I want to cut edging out as well.) if I try to control my PC muscle it only makes the urge come quicker. Am I suppose to be having it completely relaxed or what? 
 I also know to just relax and enjoy it. Control your breath, find your heart rate, etc etc... I've been in situations where that alone has definitely come in handy (having two girls in my place in their panties enjoying each other since I'm a photographer, or having a girl naked in my bed for the first time earlier this year and pleasuring her). I'll definitely keep that in mind when the time comes but just want to know about Kegels specifically.","Virgin wanting to know what specifcally during the act is it that Kegels help with to practice control?

"Hello /r/dating_advice! I'm rather nervous about posting about this, as it seems trivial, but the community here seems rather accepting and kind so I'll go through with it. 
 I'm a male, age 18, and recently moved into University.  After my first week, a few of my sophomore friends and myself went to a different campus of the same University (4 campuses, 1 University type of thing) to get some actual food and unwind.  I knew I'd be meeting a few of my other friends for a few minutes to catch up and say hi, and I knew they'd be bringing along one of their single friends.  This interested me, and I was excited to meet her. 
 As my friends and I got to the restaurant and ordered our food, my other friends texted to tell me they were outside.  I walked out and was greeted with huge hugs from my friends whom I had not seen in a while, and a handshake from a beautiful young woman(I'll call her Jane), their single friend. 
 We had a chat outside the restaurant for a while but eventually, to my displeasure, I had to return to my other group of friends.  The time i spent talking to Jane was fantastic! She was funny, loved the music I loved and was active and upbeat.  My only wish is that I could have talked to her longer. 
 After I got back to my dorm that night I added her on Facebook and contempled what I should do next.  Should I message her and try to start a conversation, or should I ask if she wants to hang out later, or do I just let fate take it's course and wait to meet her again when I vist my friends?  There's my dilema.  I'm unsure if it'd be creepy to message her saying how much fun I had talking to her and that I hope to see her again.  I'm usually pretty good and knowing what to do here, but right now I'm dumb founded.

"Hi, I'll try to make this short and simple,I am sorry for any mistakes, I am on mobile and on my lunch break. 
 I am an average girl in my 20s, I celebrated my birthday a few days ago with my boyfriend and to me it was a great day. 
 My friend, let's call her Sam asked what I did for my birthday/what presents I got. 
 Now Sam and I aren't close friends and don't hang out very often, but we occasionally talk and since we have a few interests in common, earlier today I sent her a message about one of our interests and started talking. 
 On my birthday, I spent my day with my boyfriend, he bought me all my favourite foods, we went out of lunch, we then went to see a movie at the cinemas( where I live it's very expensive so I see it as a treat) gave me a lot of cuddles and just a overall very great day. Now, my boyfriend is a lovely man, he has a lot to deal with right now, but he still takes the time to make me feel important and loved. However, he's not very big on presents, to be honest he is not very great with them, but it doesn't bother me because I am not very big on gifts. 
 The problem is when my friend asked what he bought me and I mentioned how we spent our day and what he did and how great it was, but there wasn't an actual present, she went on saying how it just shows how petty he is and he obviously doesn't care about me as much as I do for him, that I am being delusional and as I woman I should respect myself more and have higher expectations from my boyfriend. 
 To be fair, at the start she got me thinking and made me upset, but then I looked at my boyfriend (we were together at the time, but I haven't mentioned this to him yet) I realised how he's constantly telling me how he loves me, when I sleep he kisses and cuddles me, he listens and helps me with my own issues, he talks about how great and perfect I am and so on. So, I messaged my friend back saying I didn't share her view and I believed that regardless the lack of ""proper"" gifts and any big gestures I still believed my boyfriend cared for me and I was offended by her hostile message. She hasn't responded since.

"I met Darren when we were nine years old and he is my best friend. We went different paths, because he was the athletic salutatorian with a lot of ambition and I was never good at school. But we kept our friendship. 
 It didn't even distance us when he met Cassie- when he was 21. I liked her instantly, she's quiet but not shy and doesn't talk needlessly. She was a good fit for Dare because he is an extreme extrovert and never stops talking. They balanced out. That was the year my dad died and I took over his business and dealt with losing my father, so when Darren knocked up Cassie and they got married quickly--then moved a little away for his job when they graduated, I didn't see them for almost a year. 
 When I visited them I was shocked. They had the baby, a little girl named Avery. Darren had became very religious. He's started going to this small hick church and saying he can see demons-in things like Coca cola- and talking about generational sin and has added weird, minatue details to bible stories. Cassie doesn't like it, but it seemed mostly harmless. Darren's always gotten very into hobbies but this was...different. He didn't want to be an accountant anymore, he wanted to be a preacher and was applying to grad school to study theology. But even his speech pattern had changed. He was always a great public speaker but now he wasn't. 
 He wasn't the same smooth, successful guy he'd been, but a lot of people kind of flounder outside of college. It was odd, but I didn't really think anything was wrong, just sad. They'd been so in love the year before, now they had a collicky baby and Darren was off the wall. Cassie looked like she was barely holding it all together. But there was Darren saying he wanted to be a mega church preacher. 
 Then they moved home and that had passed, two years later. Darren was selling cars, and doing great at it, and Cassie was pregnant again. Later, she would tell me that Darren had swapped out her birth control because he thought it was poison and they moved home as an ultimatum. But all I knew was that Darren seemed good and they seemed ok. 
 That all derailed when Collier was born. Darren loved, loved, loved Avery. He was a great dad. But when Collier was born he unraveled. Suddenly he wasn't talking about God in a fervent passionate way or how he was this amazing salesperson, he was acting -weird-. There was something wrong with the baby, they'd given them the wrong baby. Then they'd done it on purpose. I feel bad but I thought he was just...not adjusting well. Cassie wouldn't leave him home alone with the baby. One day she went to the store and i was with him and the kids, he tried to drown Collier. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia shortly after that. 
 And they gave him medicine that worked. And he was the funny, smart guy who loved Cassie and his kids. He sold cars and paid the bills and was so damned normal. He didn't have another bad incident until the kids were 3 and 5. It ended with him drilling a hole in his forehead. The next three years were a nightmare, they tried everything but no matter what..one day, unexpectedly he would not be okay. I was there for most of it, but I still missed things-- Cassie and the kids sleeping behind a locked door, him insisting they keep all their shoes in plastic bags in the fridge, he dislocated her shoulder when she tried to make him take medication, and worst Collier developed a deep phobia of his father--who had several delusions centered around him. A five year old having panic attacks and praying that ""daddy will take his medicine"" 
 One day she showed up to my house, kids in tow and asked if they could stay. They never left. With her gone, Darren lost the slightest bit of compliance and the last four years have been simultaneously the happiest and worst of my life. I married Cassie and we are expecting a child and I love Avery and Collier like my own. Our homelife is perfect, day-to-day. 
 But Darren is unwell. He has supervised visits with Avery (Collier refuses to go) at his mother's when he feels ok. But he is frequently homeless and sick. He is unable to work. The closer we get to the due date, the guiltier I feel. 
 Cassie is amazing and I am so happy. It was easy to be a martyr and rationalize that I was merely being a good friend by taking care of his family. But since the pregnancy i feel bad, more and more I think of my son and realize that even though I feel like Collier and Avery's dad, it is at the expense of their real dad. 
 I was best man at his wedding, and now his wife is my wife. The last time I tried to see him face-to-face he became very violent after he accused me of of some outlandish stuff. Should I try and be a more active part of his life? even if I am a bad friend, I am really the only one other than his mom and daughter who seem to care about him. 
 Would seeing him just complicate my life and make my family less stable? Advice, desperately needed.","I(33m) feel horribly guilty about my marriage to my friend's exwife and happy life, including his kids (10m, 12f) while he is sick with schizophrenia.

I want to help him out, but is it the right thing to do? I don't want to make my wife or son scared or unhappy. Especially since Collier doesn't see his dad.

"Commented in a similar thread a good while ago.... copy/pasted 
 When I was about seven years old, my twin, an older brother and I had gone with a 'family friend' to go to his mothers house. This was nothing out of the ordinary as we had gone with this man on several such occasions prior. We were living somewhere in Nevada at the time, near(ish) the California border. 
 He had asked my parents if it was okay for him to take the three of us for a visit, and my parents said yes. 
 I'm not really sure at what time we left, but we never made it to his mothers house. (I was looking forward to seeing her cat again) We drove for hours, my brother, sister and I in the back seat. This man didn't stop to let us out for a bathroom break, and he didn't have anything other than beer for us to drink, and he was drinking as well. 
 After another hour or so of driving, he got pulled over. He told us not to say anything to the officers. They approached his vehicle and could smell the beer coming off of him in waves. They noticed us in the back seat and asked if we were his. He of course said yes. The officers didn't believe him. Thank God. 
 They asked him to step out of the car and placed him under arrest. He fought them the entire time until they had clubbed him into submission just to get him into the back of the cruiser. Another CHP showed up and took us with him to a foster home where we stayed until our parents could come to pick us up later.
It wasn't until fifteen years later that I had learned that the man had pedophillic intentions with the three of us. I never thought anything of the fact that he didn't bring another of my brothers with us. When the officers asked him why that was, he simply replied that the other brother would have talked.","kidnapped at 7, forced to drink beer when thirsty, nearly raped by drunk man before he was arrested.",22,M,AskReddit
"Sorry this is probably going to be a wall of text. But here we go. 
 So I'm (M/18) and my SO is (F/18). We've been together for a little over 3 years now. We were inseprable. We loved eachother more and more everyday. We had a healthy relationship for the most part and everything has been going fine. Senior years hits and some of the obstacles come to. Some of it was girls trying to flirt and get with me and some of it was deciding colleges and things like that. We had our mind set on going to the same college for years and my girlfriend asked what were my three top choices. I lied about one becuase I knew she could play volleyball for them as a walk on and it would make her happy. So she decided to commit there. I am having second thoughts and I dont really have money to pay for college. (Her parents are paying for hers.) I'd have to take out loans to go. 
 So we argued about that a lot. Then she decided to needed a break halfway through senior year. This devestated me. She said she needed some space and that she is getting anxiety and stress and she knew if if we just were Bestfriends for a little it would help. Well I tried. I tried my best but I just couldn't do it. So she ended it because the break was causing more stress than being together. So we got back together and everything became fine. 
 Forward to our last couple of days. We are closer than ever and love eachother more than ever. Everytime we thought about leaving eachother we bawled our eyes out and held eachother for long amounts of time. Then she leaves. For the first couple of days, everything is fine, were still adjusting but its okay! Then about the third or fourth day hits and stuff happens. She decides another break would make this LDR easier. She said she wants to focus on herself and stuff. But thats not the case with me. I couldn't be on a break cause I loved her so much when we went to the same school, what makes her think I can do it again while were 6 hours away? 
 I'ts been about 3 days since we went on a break. I did it again for her. But I'm going crazy. She said she doesnt see the break lasting that long but I don't know how ""long"" is. I'm scared this break will have her fall out of love with me. I'm scared some guy is going to try to do stuff with her. (Most of her friends are the football players.) Although she said she has no interest in experimenting with other guys at all, but there is always a possibility. She hasn't been acting the same lately. When we argued about the break I was always like, "" I want to make this LDR work, we need to do this, this, and this, to make it work cause I see us together in the end"". But she never said anything about us being int he end. She only replied ""yes"" and ""yeah"" whenever I asked her if she thought the same thing. 
 So today I text her a long message telling her exactly how I feel and how I feel she has changed. Because I still have a chance to attend the same college as her in the fall. I'd have to take out student loans for the first year but she is worth it to me. I feel like if we were together it would make things easier. 
 She texted me back only this so far because she has class. ""Im probably gonna tell you something either you've already heard or don't you dont want to. I am distancing myself simply because it'd make this whole thing easier. Being away is a good thing in my eyes. Honestly, I'm really excited for college. I'm on my own and I can make my own friends without following anyone or having anything hindering me. You don't like a lot of types of people and I find some of them cool and fun and I like hanging out with them. I'm sorry if i'm acting like that"" 
 I can prove to her that she wont have to follow me and I wont hinder her and we can have the same friends because usually I like her friends. Reddit I'm scared she will fall out of love with me and that something bad might happen over there. I think going to college will be a good thing for me and that if were together things will get easier. 
 A break is good for us in her eyes and for her. But for me, it isn't. I dont know what to do.","Gf of 3 years wants to go on a break to make long distance easier but its not easier for me and I'm scared of losing her.

But I begged and begged that I can do this and despite saying ""I've done so much for you."" She told me to give her a week on leaving her alone and giving her space to refocus on school. She said she is focusing on school and volleyball for OUR future. So she has the intention of being together. She said she wont do anything to hurt me. Ill update next week.",18,M,relationships
"I haven't rewatched the game, but I've been thinking over Marcus Smart's performance in the first game.  I think some of what I've settled on applies to the team overall as well.  In fact, Marcus might be the emotional center of the team (though there are many of those). 
 Marcus didn't make THE SHOT.  The Celtics didn't win the game.  But he made the play, and it was a play I have never seen before in basketball.  It was singularly amazing.  We all saw it.  On defense with . 4 seconds left, he somehow gained possession, against a bigger man, with one hand, fired the ball the length of the court, and nearly made the game-winning shot.  The Bird-to-DJ is one of the only plays I can think of like that. 
 Those are the types of plays that distinguish a player, that other players talk about.  It's not Steph blowing other players' minds with clutch 40 footers.  But it's winning basketball, it's pretty much unprecedented, and it's attractive.  Marcus is a guy who brings value-added astounding plays.  I doubt he will ever BE the offense, like, steph, russ, durant, etc.  But if you can have an offense, he's the guy who can put it over the top - like an Horry, Rasheed, Tayshaun, DJ (who might be his best comp eventually).  We love these guys in Boston - even Russell was not an offense in and of himself.  He just did absolutely everything else. 
 Smart is probably going to be among the best 3rd or 4th options in the entire league next year, fitting in seamlessly, making plus plays, gaining extra possessions, turning D into free O.  And he raises his game when it matters.  We saw this year in Toronto on the last play (that was DJesque), we saw it in the two very deliberate switches against GS, where he was iso'ed on Speights and delivered 5 points (even if they didn't win the beauty pageant), we saw it in late game o-boards multiple times earlier in the season, we saw it last night on the insane steal/fast-break/o-board-follow, and then the last play (both of these making offense out of defense).  Unfortunately, these were among the very few good plays we made in the late-game game 1. 
 That is Marcus' game, and on nights like last night, it makes him one of maybe the three most impactful players on the floor over the course of the second half.  If he gets the three-pt-shot in his arsenal, he is gold.  But what he's got now, for a 22 year old second year player, is pretty amazing. 
 To bring this back to the first paragpraph, I think good players in the league notice plays like that, especially in such a high-leverage situation, and shake their heads.  And he makes many of them.  Not as many as Steph, or Lebron, or Russ, but a lot.  And some players view that as attractive.  On the Celts, CBS is attractive, and Smart is starting to look that way too, in more of a Dray-rather-than-steph kind of way. 
 In this series, even a loss like that may have helped the C's profile among FAs.  Playing, and winning, the rest of the series in that manner could really matter to the offseason.  He and this team are awesome to watch.","plays like Smart made at the end of game 1 matter so much more than the ""steal-missed-3"" it gets recorded as on the stat sheet.  I also believe that can be said of the C's loss itself to some degree.",22,M,bostonceltics
"Playing in a soccer tournament between my junior and senior year in front of a bunch of scouts.  This is the first game of 3 for the day with the elimination rounds to follow on sunday.  I'm playing center mid and we are in our defensive third.  A guy puts a cross in, i jump to clear it, i am 6 foot tall at the time and also a volleyball player so i could really jump, and i get undercut(guy takes my legs out from under me while i'm in the air.  I land on my left shoulder and head with the rest of my lower half folding over me.  I lay there in pain for a few minutes trying, unsuccessfully, to move my legs.  I was starting to panic a little because i  thought i was paralyzed.  After 10 minutes or so, i regain feeling in my legs and am able to wobbly walk of the field.  I get my back looked at by the medical staff at the tournament and they say it was a stinger, as i understood it a temporarily pinched nerve, and that i'd be fine to play.  So i finish out the remaining 2 games of the day, not well as i would occasionally lose feeling in my right side, arm, hand, leg, and foot.  Go back the next day and we crash out in the first round. Senior year of high school training started that next week and i was complaining to the coach about how when sprinting my right side would go numb.  He wasn't a big fan of mine so he just kinda brushed it off as me not wanting to train hard.  Finally its so bad my mom takes me to a hospital for proper x-rays, first time i properly complained to her in her defense, and we come to find out i had dislodged two lower  vertebrae which could have led to permanent paralysis had i landed weird in any way.

I choose the 2nd option, but being 17 and stupid i played my senior year, not well because of here and there numbness while playing, and still managed to secure a scholarship to play soccer at Toledo university(which i didnt take because i lost faith in my back and body).

"He's now a ""consultant"" for Ambit energy. Simply typing the search term ""ambit"" in to google and the third suggestion down is ""ambit energy scam"".

He told me in confidence that he gets $100 for every 5 people that sign up and that the real money is in the residuals he will receive if he gets other people to work for them.

 Nahtanos: (using RSD Tyler's approach)  Hey! Who are you?  (By the way, this opener tends to get the, what? what fuck? reaction.  You just have to stick with it, look dead in the eyes and own it. I said this deadpan, with a flat inflection in my voice.)
Tracy: Hi, um, I'm Tracy? 
N:   super big smile  Hi, I'm Jonathan, cheers!  clink  (if you actually know how to smile and are happy about it, people will always smile back. My smile is so good its infectious.)  She smiles back and cheers  What did you think of the show? 
Tracy: It was good! What did you think?
N: It was awesome! I LOVE motown!  I start dancing in place, twirling  Hahahaha
Tracy:  hahaha, who do you know in the band?
N: My friend's brother is the front man. I came for moral support.  (ok so that past two exchanges were a good example of like being fun and then qualifying yourself.) 
Tracy: oh cool. 
N: How's your weekend?
Tracy: It's ok, how's yours? 
N: It's good, I was bartending today at the brunch shift. I don't know who decided it brunch was thing in Manhattan, but it's SUCH a thing. (All of this is done with lots and lots of enthusiasm.  It's not a strategy I adopted, it's just who I am.  I'm high energy, and again, it's infectious. People get wrapped up in it.)
Tracy: Yeah, but it's the perfect solution for being hungover!
N: haha I suppose.  If waiting in the cold for 20 mins and then paying 14 bucks for eggs is a hangover cure, I'd do it I guess. (< not afraid to disagree, to say what I think) 
 So we begin to talk about who comes into my restaurant.  This qualifies me again.  We talk about actors, I learn she's a producer.  We fluff and fluff. I do this thing where I say, hey you'd look good in glasses and then I hand the chick my glasses and I take a picture of her and show it to her.  It's really comforting to the girl.  We talk about fifty shades of grey and why so many women read that book.  I tell her she probably likes it when guys slap her on the ass and stuff her face in the pillow.    btw, her reaction to that is the wtf?what?wow! kind of thing, and again you just gotta own it  I just laugh at her and say wow you just got really uncomfortable.  Then I change the subject.  I tell her my dream is to become the president of the United States, and I grab her shoulders when I do this.  Slight kino.  More fluff, more slight kino, pushing her away, punching her lightly on the arm. So it's going well.  I'm making her laugh, I'm qualifying myself by showing her I have a fucking life and fucking dreams.  I'm kino-ing slightly, trying to push-pull. 
 Unfortunately, her friend comes back and asks if she wants a beer.  She offers to buy me one so I say yeah.  We get the beer and there's three of us at the bar and we're all bantering and stuff.  We talk about 3-D printers, etc. We talk about my becoming future President and how I'd have to appeal to ""their humanity"" in order to get their vote or some bullshit like that.  The friend leaves and i'm starting to get a buzz and she starts talking about politics.  Because I've just been going where the interaction takes me, I unfortunately let her go on and on about it. I mean on the one hand, it was natural, but she was floundering cause she didn't know what the fuck she was talking about.  I let it happen cause I didn't want to have a jarring shift in convo.  Anyways, my brain is starting to panic a little.  She's not having as MUCH fun as earlier and I'm wondering how i can amp the conversation a little more.  (As a progress note, this is like 10 minutes into the interaction. If her emotional level was at a 0 when I approached, she was at a 5 now, out of 10)  But I didn't know how to really amp up anymore. 
 More unfortuantely, her friend comes back and tells us they're gonna move on to the next bar.  I say im gonna stay with my friends, so I say;
N: Have coffee with me on Monday
Tracy: ehh, I work on Monday. 
N: (FUCK!) Alright.  (So I kinda sulk off a little, like face the bar, and not her. She turns to her friend, fluff with her.  I'm thinking about what I could possibly say to recover. I'm not sure what to do, I wait a few seconds.) 
N: When are we gonna hang out. 
Tracy: Nahtanos, how old are you?
N: you really wanna know? I'm 23. 
Tracy: i'm 32, This is not gonna happen. 
N: Oh my God!! I asked if you wanted to hang out, not fuck me!(hahahahahhaha, dunno why i said that, cause i totally wanted to fuck her)
Tracy: Ok i just wanted to make sure my intention was clear. (hahaha i guess that's good, because it showed that my intent was fucking clear the whole time.  she knew wassup) 
 She gives me some shit about how at women, post 28 years old, something clicks and like SO much shit has already happened that they're in a completely different place in life and all this shit.  I say sure sure sure. 
 N: Do you have any single friends?
T: I know a 19 year old at NYU. She's cute.
N: Awesome, we're all gonna hang and you're gonna introduce me to her.
T: cool! See yah! 
 SO! Lessons learned.  I dunno.  I know for SURE that:","1) I owned the approach.  You gotta.  The interaction will flow so naturally after that
2) It is natural to qualify yourself in between showing attraction.  LoveSystems posits this as a linear stage from attraction--> qualification --> comfort --> seduction.  It's not necessarily linear, but you have to solidify one before you get to the next.  Comprende?
3) I was successfully able to move to comfort stage.  However, I could've amped the interaction a lot more.  I was afraid, and I wanted to look like a normal human being.  I didn't call her a DOG and stare her down, but alas, she only stayed at a 5 out of 10 on the emotional scale.  AMP MORE AMP MORE!!! 
 Thanks guys.  This was my first post.  Keep at it!",23,M,seduction
"So this happened nearly seven months ago now, I'm starting to see my life in a kind of BC/AD way with regards to this event. 
 So I went interrailing with a couple of friends of mine last summer. For the unaware, ""interrailing"" is a wonderful system that Europeans such as myself (UK) have enjoyed for half a century now. Essentially you dish out a large amount of cash for a ticket that allows you to board any train in the EU for a month. My mother did it in the seventies and now it was my turn. 
 Many teenage kicks ensued. 
 Towards the end of the trip we found ourselves in Rome, at almost 4am wandering the streets drunkenly realising that we probably  weren't  going to find any clubs open at this time. So we opted in stead for a peregrination to an establishment bearing the crest of ""McDonalds"". And it was during this quest for grotesquely processed produce that my lovely fuck-up occurred. 
 Yes, I was very drunk. Not the most drunk I had been that trip, not by far, but certainly very inebriated. Fuelled by near a full month of adolescent romps my ego was concerned that I prove that I was most certainly, a wild one. Yes, I was one of the cool kids. Look, I just climbed to the top of this ladder! Look, I just climbed to the top of this wall! 
 Ah, how do I get down again? The voice of my friend, next to me, who also scaled the fence like a horny squirrel, is now anxiously encouraging me to jump down, quick. I look down. Pavement. Well, I'll have to get over my fear of heights some time, why not now? 
 This is going to hurt, isn't it? 
 Yes. 
 S is convinced I'm just being a massive puss again but calls an ambulance for me just to make sure. C later revealed he, too, thought I was overreacting when he heard the first scream, but then I kept screaming. And screaming. I stopped screaming, they went to get McDonalds. I'm alone. I feel like I'm dying. It hurts like hell, but even more I'm the thirstiest I've ever been. I'm so thirsty. Everything starts spinning. I can't breath. I'm dying, oh shit. I remember some breathing excercises. I practice them. Sanity reasserts itself. The friends return, and soon an ambulance arrives. C forgot to pick up my fuckin water. I didn't care much at the time. I kept thinking how nice all the staff were in spite of being clearly exhausted. Agua, por favore. Grazie. 
 Broken calcaneus. Lover's fracture. I fucked up my heel bone. The rest of my summer was pretty boring after I got home a few days later. It took so fucking long to walk again. All the muscles in my right leg wasted while I was in the cast, they're still not back yet, quite. Life is good, university is cool, if a bit lonely. But the doctor said I might never feel normal again. Walking. I should avoid ""high impact training"". Like what? Running? 
 Fucking running? 
 I run everywhere. I used to. In secondary school I was that weird kid who runs everywhere. It's a part of me in a big way, I've always done it. I still can't run now, in mid-february. I've mostly got my physical confidence back, I even went to Poland and learnt how to snowboard last week (I know, I'm fucking lucky), but I can't run and I still limp. My life is fucking awesome, objectively, but a piece is missing. It sucks. I don't mind getting arthritis when I'm old so much, but I want to be able to be young. I didn't feel regretful at the time, jumping off that wall felt like an inevitability, but I thought my young body would bounce back in a couple of months. I didn't even consider it could be permanent. 
 I still think I will be able to run again, but I hope you can agree this is fucking annoying. 
 HELLO ALL YOUNG PEOPLE. You are not indestructible. Not only can you die, but your body is actually very fragile. You're probably imagining I jumped off some giant wall. Nope. Dude, it was about eight feet. I really didn't think that height could permanently fuck you up, but yeah, it can. Be careful out there, have fun, be rad and break the rules but don't ever think you have something to prove by jumping off shit. Don't drink and climb.

"My girlfriend[19F] of a year and a half broke up with me[18M] after three months of long distance summer relationship. It wasn't because I was a bad bf or anything, it's because she fell in love with her best friend[18F]. We never had sex and for about 8 months before the break up we had no time to fit any intimate interactions into our schedule (ex: foreplay, oral..) We did however go on dates and she always was amazingly happy after the dates. 
 I'm part of their friend group and I still talk to my ex since we were amazing friends and still have similar interests. Just yesterday, she wanted to talk to me about the sex she's having with her new girlfriend and possibly tips to make them comfortable since I was so great with foreplay(when we actually did it) and a lot of lesbian sex is foreplay. This not only made me uncomfortable but jealous af. How is it fair that we were together for more than a year and never had sex but they've been together for a month and they do it everyday(they live together btw so woo jealously). I gave her all the tips but I just feel so sexually frustrated and horny af 
 When she said she really wanted to see me(before break up) I thought we were going to do some intimate stuff. No one was home, she just got back from her long distance trip and I was ready to get down(even if it was just going to be foreplay and oral). Instead she broke up with me and I'm bursting with sexual frustration. Masterbation isn't working because all I think of is her. I can't seem to cum without thinking about her and that really fucks up my mind since we're broken up. I've been trying to talk to other girls and get out but I just can't connect with someone the way I did with her. I started lifting and eating healthier too to try to let out some of that frustration but I'm finding it to be even stronger than before 
 What are some ways to keep my mind off her when I masterbate? ways to release sexually frustration?","bisexual gf broke up with me for her best friend(female). they've had sex all the time.

"So I went to a birthday party with some friends and met alot of old school buddies from 3rd-10th grade. We all had a good time, then there were only 4 people left, her [20F] and me [21M] being amongst them. 
 She got really imtimate with me, pulled us away from the other two, and told me that she had lost some interest in her current boyfriend [20M] (which she have been with for almost 5 years) because she had realized she was in love with me. She then proceeded to try to kiss me while I told her not to. This was hard because I was pretty drunk too, and actually find her really attractive. 
 We've known each other for at least 11 years, and there have never been anything romantic between us, as we've both only looked at one another as a good friend. But the more I think about it the more I want it to be us. I talked to her yesterday and she said she didn't remember. That may be for the best because her current boyfriend and me have become good friends. 
 I have little to no idea how to handle this situation as she doesn't want to know what happened, but not telling her makes it hard for me to carry on. I know it might've been the alcohol talking, but at the same time, it could've been her subconcious. Telling her has a high chance to ruin her current relationship. 
 What can/should I do in my current situation? 
 Edit : I shoul've mentioned that me [21M] and the girl [20F] have been friends for over a decade, and have been and are still in the same clique. It's believable that she could possess feelings for me seeing how close we've been with eachother thoughout half of our lifes, and do have many of the same interests. 
 We've been to several parties with the same clique and have always had a good time together, and she'd often ask me about how I was doing in my life (mostly my love life). So I doubt she would play with my feelings, although I'm not saying it is impossible. 
 Also, thanks for the help so far, even though it didn't bring any closure.","Girl drunkenly confesses love for me, whilst having a boyfriend. I had subcouncious feelings for her. She forgets, I'm stuck witch remembering.",21,M,relationships
"He's 25 and I'm 20f. We've been together almost a year and for the past couple of months we've had an on-off relationship. Until a few months ago he was an amazing boyfriend, seemed happy with me but he would often confide in me how he felt stuck in a rut of just working a dead-end job and not bettering himself. I've always tried to just listen, and encourage him. Just generally be as supportive as I could be. 
 Now he goes back and forth a lot, he'll say he loves me and wants to be with me and make things work, we'll get back together and things will be great for a while until he eventually starts acting very apathetic; he seems uninterested in pretty much everything, it's like nothing really makes him happy anymore and he starts neglecting our relationship which leads to another break up. He recently quit his job without even having another one lined up. When I asked why he quit, he had no reason at all. He said he just didn't want to work there anymore. He hasn't been applying for jobs at all, he doesn't go to school and he's moving back into his parents' house next week. Now he just sleeps until the late afternoon and plays video games. He's been neglecting his friendships as well. The last time we saw each other, we got into an argument and he broke up with me. He said he didn't want to 'deal' with anything anymore, he's sick of being stressed. He got really angry with me and told me he didn't want to hear from me again. I told him not to say something he couldn't take back, he apologized and told me to just give him some time to himself. He was still really mad and it's pretty clear he doesn't want to speak to me for a while. 
 I really think he's either depressed or bipolar. I could be wrong, maybe I'm just trying to find a reason why he's given up on us... I don't know. I know I should just leave him alone, I just need some support and maybe some advice? Has anyone else been in this kind of situation? Does he sound depressed or did he just fall out of love or something? I've asked him numerous times why he keeps alternating between being an awesome bf to a shitty bf and he says he honestly doesn't know. I've frequently asked point-blank if he just isn't that into me or if he just doesn't want a relationship and he promises that he loves me and is very into me, and wants to be with me etc... But then he neglects the relationship and one of us ends up breaking it off again. I've told him over and over again that if he just isn't in love with me anymore to tell me and he still insists that that isn't it and that he doesn't know what's wrong with him but he does want to try and he 'absolutely' wants to be with me and treat me the way I deserve. I've also asked him before if he thinks he's depressed and he kinda got defensive and said he probably is before he changed the subject and told me to drop it. Depression also runs in his family, and one of his close relatives had severe depression and committed suicide a couple years ago. 
 I feel crazy, I know I should walk away but I love him very much and I'm so worried about him. Even if we're not together I want to be there for him if he really has some kind of disorder or depression... now I'm just rambling... Anyone have any advice?",BF seems to be depressed and throwing his life and our relationship away. Not sure if I'm just making up an excuse to feel better about being dumped.

"He's my best friend (and roommate/significant other), and I have purchased him a book I thought he'd like (very cheap anyways), but he doesn't read for leisure often, so I'm trying to think of some other fun things he'd like. 
 He's really into nerd culture. I was thinking of getting a 'nerdy' shirt for him, but most of them are pretty pricey, and I don't see the appeal of spending $10 or more on a shirt when you can get a pack of shirts for the same price. I'd love to get him a tie, but I don't really know what tie colors matches with the colored oxfords he wears. 
 He loves video games, but already has a huge inventory for steam account and x box. However, if there's a game that's not vastly popular and is fun for x box, a suggestion would be great :)) 
 He loves Star Wars. A lot. He has figurines, posters, books from the expanded universe, etc. I would like to purchase something Star Wars related, but again, Star Wars paraphernalia is more on the costly side, and I have a limited amount of currency.

"I know, I love puns too much, but I can't help it. Here's my situation. 
 In 2 weeks from today (4/21), I'll turn 22. That's 22 years of having never even held a girls hand. I've been single my entire life. Not too long, I know, but I had my first crush when I was 5, and failed since then. To be fair, I'm also very picky with girls, and only find somebody I like once every 2 or 3 years. I recently liked a girl, and found it odd that she hugs everybody but me. Fatter, slimmer, taller, shorter, and all races. I have no clue why, but it hurts. I live off of hugs. Now, I'm dumb, and told her I liked her after a while, hoping she might like me too. No, of course not. I'm The Friend. It's like some sort of gift. I'm always a close friend. Forever a close friend. So not only do I fail, I'm reminded of it forever. That's one thing. 
 I've been a pushover for a while. People cutting in line in front of me, people making me dodge them as they attempt to walk through me, even a sales clerk yelling at me for picking something I dropped once and accidentally putting it in the wrong spot. That last one made something switch in me. I put all my things back and left. Now I don't let people do those things to me. I make them get behind me in lines, I let them collide with me and bounce back because I'm sturdy as all hell. I started standing up for myself. That had made me proud. Now, though, most of my friends are getting annoyed with me over it. So by growing a spine, I'm damaging my ties with my friends, especially the girl I mentioned before. 
 My birthday is two weeks away, and nobody seems to care. There are two things they're excited for. 1) Diablo 3, and 2) another friend's birthday which happens to be on the same day. It's kind of depressing. I mean, it's not a hard day to remember. 5/5, Cinco de Mayo, etc. Plus it's on Facebook, and I've been mentioning it, hoping somebody would say something. If they were the kind for a surprise party, that'd be one thing. But they're not. 
 My friends are really great people, don't get me wrong. Last year one of my friends made me an awesome card with Mudkips. First card I've received (besides family, since they kinda have to or that's just really depressing) in a long time, and it was awesome. I love all of them. But I feel I'm pushing them away without meaning to, and of course don't know how to make it stop. 
 I know this post seems complainy and long and overly-detailed and disorganized, but I've been holding it in for a while. I want nobody to know, so I'm using this account.

"I'm a 17-year-old boy and I was diagnosed a week ago with ADHD-PI. Turns out my dad has it too, but since he's lived with it for so long without knowing, he's got his own coping mechanisms and doesn't need any form of treatment. Myself, on the other hand, being young, have already been prescribed 20mg of vyvanse and was told to come back in two weeks to talk about continuing the prescription/changing the dosage. 
 A little about myself, I have always had abysmal grades and have always chalked it up to being lazy. I have horrible self-confidence and constantly tell myself I have no talent and no future, even when regarding things I know I'm very good at. I find happiness in making music and acting and dancing, all of which I have been doing for a number of years. 
 Now that I've been told I have ADHD, it's been a little easier to live with all the things I've constantly beat myself up for, but it feels like I'm using it as an excuse now, which I dislike. But I'm told by a friend who has ADHD-C and Asperger Syndrome that it gets better, although he was diagnosed at a much younger age. I'm starting to see a therapist every week, and hopefully that'll clear some things up. 
 However, the last few days have really left me frustrated, lost, and frankly, a little pissed. I was diagnosed by my therapist last week, but was never actually told until we met on Wednesday. However, my parents were told right off the bat. They were immediately offered a medication solution, which they took. When my mom and I went to go see the doctor, she and my mom had a full ten minute conversation about medication and my newfound ADHD and everything, and didn't once acknowledge me in the room. We started me on vyvanse the next morning. 
 The worst part for me is that I was never ever told what having ADHD means, what part of me is ADHD and what part isn't. I was never informed what exactly I should hope to expect from taking medication. Hell, I was never told what medication I was taking until after I started. Everything I now know about ADHD has been through my own independent research, and I know I've just barely scratched the surface. Everything around me seems to be dragging me along suddenly much faster than before the diagnosis, and throughout this whole process I've felt this giant feeling of a rush to fix what has been revealed as wrong for me. 
 I'm not sure where to go about this except to just continue research and continue taking this medication, which doesn't seem to change anything (probably because it's very small, although I am a very skinny guy), but still leaves me drained and horribly tired at the end of the day. 
 Just needed a space to rant all this out, and I didn't want to bother my friends, who are all at the big school football game having fun right now.

"I've already told this story once before but didn't receive much recognition. It's a story about when I nearly set someone on fire. 
 So, one day, at my local college doing a level 2 in professional catering & hospitality, we were searing salmon in oil when all of a sudden Ed Balls and 5 cameramen from the BBC walk in wanting an interview with a student. Me at the time, just turned 16, just stood there in fear hoping not to be interviewed by the arsehole that removed EMA (Educational Maintenance Allowance). So my friend walks away slowly as I'm confronted by the huge camera and member of parliament and asked about my opinion on EMA being discontinued. I continued to answer him before his attention went to my salmon, I had cooked one side incorrectly so awkwardly explained to him in small talk before all of a sudden my pan blew up a 6 foot fireball, Ed and the cameramen dodging the flames as my tutor (Ex-chef at The Ritz) came to my rescue reducing the flames as I shake Ed's hand timidly and proceed to talk to my co-workers when they all go crazy because they wanted to be interviewed but as soon as they saw the cameramen walk in I was done for and they all hid.","The BBC interviewed me in front of a hot oven at college, nearly set a member of parliament on fire.",16,M,AskReddit
"So this happened the other day actually, but friday was my birthday (dancing queen, young and sweet, only 17), and I planned on having a pretty cool birthday party on Saturday. Pizza, cake, video games, the works. The thing is, most of my friends graduated last june, so i dont have much for friends, except my Youth Group that i attend after school. So me being the lonely little shit that I am, invite my Youth Group friends, about 10-13 16 and 17 year olds, a good party. Except, as I was handing out invitations, a few kids said they had to work that weekend, but ""they'd try to make it.""  Another thing to mention is that these kids all live in town, and I live out in the country, and its about a half hour drive.  I drive it twice a day 4 times a week, shouldnt be a problem for these guys.  Anyways, as the week before my birthday went on, I was getting increasingly nervous, and anxious, and scared, because what if they dont want to come? what if they cant come? what if no one shows up?  So finally wednesday rolls around, after youth group, driving a girl to her house afterwards.  I casually ask if her and her brother, another invitee, will be showing up friday night, and she says maybe. Her and her friend that drives her everywhere were ""fighting"" at the time, so she didnt know if she could get a ride. I say okay, say I'd talk to her tomorrow, drive away and lose. My. Shit. I'm driving, I'm bawling my eyes out, I'm yelling at myself and hitting myself and asking myself why I'm so dumb and why i would even consider having a party when I'm stupid and gross and nobody likes me anyways. I get home, snapchat everyone ""partys cancelled"", get drunk, ask God why i'm such a fuckup, and cry myself to sleep.  Skip school on thursday, lay in bed all day crying and feeling like crap, mother is kind and makes a good supper as an ""early birthday supper"" because i felt bad and we had to work the next day. Worked friday, was better, still upset about me being stupid, everyone texting me ""happy birthday"" and facebook posts whatever. Saturday, do fuck all, clock strikes 6 pm, sad because i dont have a party, so parents take me out for supper. Nice. While we're at supper, my stomach starts hurting. Come home, go to the bathroom.

"Back in 2005 (3rd grade), this kid (let's call him John) started riding my bus. He, a couple of other people, including my future boyfriend, and I became pretty good friends throughout elementary school, into middle school, and even today in high school. John got closer to me in 2011 (6th grade) just by talking about books and video games. However, this friendship started moving off the bus and into the classroom. He would sit with me during lunch and during class, but my naive self didn't think anything of it. 
 A year later was the first time he asked me out. My friends had been teasing me for months about him, but I insisted it was just platonic. He proved me wrong when he slipped a note in my locker telling me how pretty I was, along with a pen with a plastic parrot on top (how romantic; in his defense, the pen was a pretty hot item at the Scholastic Book Fair). In response, I wrote a note explaining while I was flattered, I wasn't interested and gave the parrot back. 
 After this first attempt I could tell something was wrong. John was a bit moody and we distanced a little, but he came back a couple of months later and we were friends again, just not as close as before. 
 The next year, I started dating a family friend who went to a different school. Eight months later, I broke up with him because he cheated on me. John and another friend from the bus, let's call him Andy, immediately told me he was an asshole and didn't deserve me. 
 Two years later, 2013/sophomore year, he asked me out to go see a movie. I was completely taken by surprise and I had no idea what to say, but I didn't want him to be upset so I told him that it wasn't a good time. To be fair, I was having a lot of family problems and I really didn't want to date anyone at the time, but no matter what I didn't want to date him. I could tell he was a bit upset but that could be expected. 
 Less than two weeks later, I started dating Andy. John was PISSED because he and Andy hated each other (ironically, they're both extremely similar). John didn't speak to me for the duration of the relationship. Andy told me that it was because John was jealous; he revealed to me that he and his friends had known John had liked me since third grade. 
 At the end of Andy and I's relationship, John started saying that Andy was a sociopath: he was manipulative, he was dating me just to spite John, he was just trying to sleep with me. To be fair, Andy might very well be a sociopath but you can see where I might see a red flag or two. We broke up soon afterward and John made sure to be there for me, though I was clear that it definitely not a good time. 
 This year, 2014, John's becoming more persistent. He tried making a move on my best friend (also not interested and looks EXACTLY like me). He's given me gifts. He's texting me more often, often texting again after a couple of hours wihout me replying his original text. He's offerer beating up the asshat that tried to touch me. He's asked me out 3 times in a matter of months. Each time I brush it off, never flat out saying ""I don't like you, leave me alone,"" but I'm getting to my wits end. I don't know how he can't get the hint: he ALWAYS texts me first; I NEVER give him a straight answer as to plans; I avoid any contact that might be considered intimate; I've dated multiple guys that I haven't even mentioned here. I don't want to be an asshole, I don't want to do it over text, and I don't want him to blow up, but I'm not interested. What do I do?",The guy who's liked me for 8 years doesn't seem to understand that I'm just not that into him. How do I turn him down without being an asshole?,17,F,relationships
"I'm new to working insurance. I work in a top 6 insurance company working as a personal injury protection adjuster, and I'm just having a really hard time adjusting to my job. I'm just having a lot of trouble actually believing a lot of people that I have to process claims for. I feel like over half of my insureds that I deal with are in low impact accidents that have soft tissue injuries. Many of them were already treating with chiropractors, and get into very minor accidents whose treatment ends up costing sometimes ten times more than it costs to repair their vehicles. Before I even got this job I kind of thought Chiropractic treatment was a joke, and I have a hard time dealing with my insureds who get into an accident and go to their chiropractor the same day. My coworkers and bosses keep telling me that I am too quick to wanting to refer people to IME's and need to wait at least six weeks before I do anything close to that. I am really just having trouble seeing how someone can be injured with no structural or frame damage to their car, no mechanical damage. Basically I am having a really hard time finding any mechanism of injury. I've been in two major car accidents myself, and have never needed anything beyond a single doctors visit. I understand that I am young and I can recover faster than someone who is older - but I still always account for age when I am evaluating peoples injuries. It is true that I don't have any medical training, but I am trying to learn as much as I can. I guess my biggest problem is trying to stay objective when evaluating my claims. The hardest part is when people don't ever actually see a doctor, because I feel that chiropractors just encourage even the smallest amount of pain because their treatment is palliative and relieves discomfort temporarily, but what I don't understand is how anyone can be put on a 3 month treatment plan going to the chiropractor and massage therapy three times a week for an accident that was incredibly low impact repairs weren't even made to the vehicle. I'm really trying to do well in my job, and I really feel like I do try to find a reason to pay for everything. I know my job is to find coverage, but I also know that I will need to answer questions later if I pay for treatment that is obviously not related. 
 Sorry for the rant, but after working 50+ hours this week I feel like my job is not trying not to make people whole again after their accident, but paying for their ""feel good' treatments.",I'm having trouble taking PIP claims seriously that are incredibly low impact and come back with outrageous treatment plans.

"I'm a 35 year-old dude that has recently decided not to be fat and slow. I've very significantly changed my eating habits and I'm getting regular exercise (hour plus walk every day). I am losing weight at a pretty regular rate and that's all fine and good.

I'm primarily interested in increasing (well, if we're honest, bringing into existence) my upper body strength. I have no desire to look like He-Man. I just want my body to work less like that of a three-toed sloth. 
 I also don't want to purchase a pile of equipment. Like I said, I've got some basic dumbbells, a mat, etc. Also, before you suggest it, I am not paying for or going to a gym under any circumstance.

"Actual parent here: 
 I once threw my then 13-year old stepson out of the house (minus his brand-new trainers) for calling his mum a cunt. I ran off after him but he had disappeared. 10 hours later, his dad phoned to say he had arrived safely at his apartment in Edinburgh, Scotland. The kid had hitchhiked 300 miles, barefoot. 
 He returned home after spending six months with his dad, during which he shoplifted and truanted from school. 
 Years later, I disowned him after a string of robberies and assaults were linked to him. He got his girl pregnant so he joined the army but they split up when he went to prison for going AWOL too many times. 
 His mother died two years later and our relationship went into a steep decline ending in his permanent banishment from our home. He burgled the house repeatedly, threatened his brothers and assaulted his father until he finally ended up in prison for beating up his ex's new boyfriend. No matter what he did, his brothers stood by him which made it almost impossible for me to maintain any control over the situation. In desperation, I started to spend more and more time away, assuming that the less I was around, the sooner the situation would return to normal. It didn't. 
 We hadn't spoken in years when I spotted him walking past a cafe I was in with his brothers. I'd just been paid and had given each of them a wad of cash and I wanted to give him his share, no matter what our differences. Before I had a chance to give him his envelope, he turned and stalked away. 
 That was the last I saw of him until recently when we became friends on Facebook.

"12 years old when it was decided I needed braces. Mom took me in to have 4 teeth removed a few weeks before they came on - I was not told of this, I had assumed they would just wire me up. The Dentist injected my gums and told me to close my eyes and relax. A few moments later It feels like something is wrenching my teeth. Literally feels like wrenching a nail from warped wood or something. 
 I push his hand away and start clawing my way out of the chair. I'm in full panic mode. The dentist sends for my mom and a few male assistants to hold me down and I run out of the room and into the waiting area to leave the place. One of the assistants just dragged me backwards and I'm yelling ""I can still feel it! I can feel you trying to yank my fucking teeth out! Help!"" I'm begging at this point as I'm held into place and the dentist starts again. I scream really loudly as he begins on the same tooth and I'm sobbing that I can still feel him trying to yank my tooth out. 
 He ends up giving me another dose of injection and yet I can still feel it. I'm still begging and crying for him to stop - my mom's furious at me and tells him to continue. He apologizes saying he can't give me another anesthetic shot and goes through with removing all 4. I had to be carried out bridal style through the waiting room to the car while I'm quietly crying with gauze in my mouth to tired to walk myself.

"I am a 20yr-old/m college student at a small university.  I have known this girl (20/f) for more than a year now.  We met at orientation and hit it off really well.  We would hang out all the time, and we became very close.  She started dating someone first semester and they broke up just after Christmas.  I was there when they broke up and we talked about it and I helped her through it.  When she was in the relationship, we didn't talk much (for obvious reasons), so it was really nice to reconnect.  Then, when things had gotten so much better, I worked up the courage to ask her out, but she was dating some other  guy (21/m).  That relationship lasted from February to about June of this year.  I was the first person that she called, because she was worried about the health of the relationship, and I gave my advice about what he was doing/feeling/whatever.  Two days later, he dumped her.  I was there for that and cheered her up.  So we talked every day (she lives three states away) on the phone, and the first week in July, I finally just told her how I feel about her.

"In a room in a house there lived a Vapor, not a nasty dirty wet room, filled with... Oh.. sorry.
Hi all, I am sigmaQuotient and I am here to share a fun little adventure I had today pertaining to the advancement in my vaping experience. Well.. Enjoy! or don't. 
So today..I suppose technically yesterday since it is 2am EST. I had to get up far earlier than I normally awaken to this world. I was on a quest to take my beloved to the Philly airport for a plane to an internship. Living in the Berks County area, this was a good hour and a half escort quest. So no mindless mob killing or collection quests mind you.
I successfully dropped her off, with a departure filled with kisses and promises of some sweet sweet candy (BAM!) later. As I took the wrong turns, leading me deeper into the city of brotherly love...mayhap carnal.. who knows, but I hope not. Anyway, I was sitting at a traffic light contemplating where being swept out my door may take me. I figured.. HEY! I can go visit The Vapor Chef! After slambamming the coordinates into my phone, I realized ""Bummer, its kinda out of my way, and I have to go to work in a few hours.."" So, sadly I made my way back to the road that goes on and on, down to the door where it began.
Something blasted my mind with rays of intrigue and past memories of a vape shop in Phoenixville. I thought, ""well.. why the fuck not eh?"" So with my trusty steed, Sheila, The Dodge Neon, I plotted my course to lands only partially known. My destination was Liberty Vapor. While this may not seem like much to most, I have only been vaping for 4 months and have never visited a true shop. 
My vape life was a collage of websurfing for the best prices and information. With a hodgepodge of parts from different corners of the Interwebs. My vape at my side is my trusty Vamo V5 with a pink Protank II(I was under the assumption it was red, but the wonderful woman in my life has pointed out.. it is pink) with a rebuilt coil I did myself!
So I drove up the snow drifted streets of Phoenixville to find a wonderful little shop with a sign saying ""Liberty Vapor"" So I dismounted, leaving Sheila to her own accord, and proceeded to enter the shop...
I am immediately hit my the sweet sweet smell of juice. Oh and BY THE GODS it was glorious. It is a clean, beautifully put together store. I kick the snow from my boots and head inside. I sit at the bar and discuss I am a vapor and happened to stop in while on a journey. I was welcomed with open arms by these Cadillac's of men, these...Adonis's of Vapor. I set to discussing vaping while sampling their juices. All of which were lovely. 
I was tempted to purchase myself my first mech, but thought long and hard. Being reminded that I still had a journey, and Sheila needed food and rest. I decided against the purchase of batteries, mech, and RDA. Instead, I indulged myself in their Stars N Stripes juice, which is a wonderfully fresh blend of Strawberry, Blueberry, and Cream. I felt Uncle Sam firmly patting my buttocks as I decided upon it. I smiled and internally shuttered with an orgasm that George Washington probably felt as he beat up British kids. I also picked up my first RDA! an IGO-W4. So after trading currency for supplies, I said my heart felt good byes. In hopes that on my return to the airport, I will return with my lady love and show her the wonders of the shop.
 I mounted my vigilant metallic steed Sheila and drove off into the west... and kinda North. I returned home after many miles, and made my way into the room that is not nasty or dirty. I proceeded to level up my coil making skill and build my first RDA(From 28ga Kanthal and Sterile cotton) which I then took to work with me. I have been using it all day and night, and Love it!
So now, here I sit, recapping my journey with you all, and puffing away on my juice and new RDA. I hope you enjoyed my journey. It was quite fun, and mayhap in the next week, I will venture forth to the cozy tavernesque wonder which is Liberty Vapor.

"Haven't seen one of these yet, figured some people might have questions about drumming or drummers in general. 
 How I became a drummer: 
 I first became interested in music as something more than an idle distraction when I listened to Rush's ""A Farewell To Kings"" when I was 10 or 11. Made me completely change the way I thought about music. I started playing guitar right around that time, self-teaching myself and learning how to play (mostly Rush) songs. During late elementary school I went through a major songwriting phase, but it kinda died off in High School (to this day I wish it didn't, but I can't argue with musical writer's block...) 
 I actually started playing drums proper in Grade 9. My maternal grandfather was a big band drummer years back, and had a really old kit at his house I would mess around with from time to time, and I had a fairly natural sense of rhythm and beat right from the getgo. When grade 10 came, I was eligible to play in the school Jazz Band. I originally tried out on guitar, but I've never been particularly good at it, and have quit in the years since, so I didn't make the audition. Then, my music teacher, who had seen me mess around a bit behind the kit in grade 9 music, asked me if I wanted to try out for drums. I said ""Sure, I'll give it a shot."" I showed up to the audition without owning, nor ever actually playing, a full kit before (my grandfathers was a 2-piece snare + bass, with hihats and a crash/ride). My competition were two Niner Punk drummers who were terrible, a grade 11 who smacked the drums so hard he gave the teacher a headache (his words!), and myself: all I played for him was a basic swing beat, and apologized with ""Sorry that's really all I know"". He said ""Don't worry: you have the feel. That's what they lack. You can learn the rest."" I played 4 years of HS jazz band (Musicfest Canada Gold 1 year [12], Silver 3 years [10-11, 13]), then stopped playing to go to Uni. Did a year of that, got sick of it and came back home, got a double-kick pedal from my parents for my 20th birthday, and have been rocking out ever since (22 now)! 
 Kit: Tama Swingstar (got it half-way through Grade 10 when I decided I needed to practice at home too ;-)), 5-piece.

"I am 36 years old, and I was pretty beta in my younger years. I've made a ton of progress, including having a relationship with the girl of my dreams a few years ago. But I have become pessimistic about women to the point where I haven't been looking for a new girlfriend, and I didn't really care about not having sex lately. I believe it's more trouble than it's worth. 
 My karate dojo moved to a bigger place in September, and they added a Crossfit program. After a week or 2, I liked the new 26 year old Crossfit instructor so much that for the first time in my entire life I quit doing everything wrong. I stopped playing video games, stopped eating junk food, I worked out hard, etc. It's important to note that my entire life I had been trying to motivate myself to be the best I could be, and I couldn't do it. But at age 36, this girl had inspired me to fix all these mistakes simultaneously. Yes, this put her on a pedestal. 
 I think I was trying to make myself good enough for her. It's important to mention that I have a ton going for me already. There are plenty of girls that would love to have me. But I'm chasing a 9 or a 10 here with a great personality. 
 I had concluded she was single. I didn't want to wait too long, and risk her starting a new relationship, so I was going to ask her out. I was trying to move communication with her forward, and speed things up a little, and I contacted her on Facebook. (She was friends with a few people from the dojo and a couple of mutual friends from the area.) I basically said ""let me know if you can see this message."" And she ignored me, but she saw the message because Facebook marks messages as ""read."" 
 I was really annoyed that she couldn't even respond ""yeah, what's up?"" But I know the wrong thing to do is to keep typing, or get mad. Anyways, I couldn't hide the fact that I liked her, and I continued light-hearted hitting on her in the next few weeks. I'm pretty sure she knew I liked her. 
 I know, I know. I have oneitis. I put a girl on a pedestal. I pushed her away by giving her too much attention. I messed up. 
 Then she signed this guy up for her Crossfit program. I didn't consider him a threat. To be completely honest with you, I said to myself ""why would you start a relationship with that average dude, when I'm pursuing you?"" 
 2 weeks later, I asked him, and he told me he was her boyfriend. I acted calm, but I accidentally went home without my bag. When I went back in an hour, she was standing there looking at me, and she had the textbook look on her face that said ""I just played you so hard."" Totally smug and self-satisfied. I haven't been back in 3 weeks because I really don't feel like looking at this situation. It breaks my heart. 
 So what do I do? I don't think I should do Crossfit, and hi-five her damn boyfriend, while I try to stifle my emotions. But karate is 2 days a week, and she is there having a great time with the boyfriend right next to the karate. It's impossible to ignore, and she is very loud. 
 I am about 6 months away from getting a black belt- I've been there 4.5 years. I don't really care about the belt, and I could definitely live without doing karate there. But there is a very huge embarrassment factor for me if I leave there because of this. Also, people will be very disappointed that I'm not there, because I make the dojo a better place with my skills, intelligence, and character.","Hard to summarize, but the girl of my dreams ignores me, starts a new relationship, and now I have to choose between watching them have a great time in a social setting, or walking away from my karate dojo.

"Like many fuck ups this happened a While ago and I was just reminded of it and thought I would share. For some backround at the time I was in 8th grade and I went to a small school, also I was super fuckking dumb and was pretty out of shape. 
 To the fuck up: so I had a huge crush on this 7th grader, she was a year behind me and so I never saw any thing wrong with it. Well in the 7th grade class their were two main groups of girls, one had a girl named Hayley and the other had a girl named viviana. I thought both Hayley and Viviana were hot, and talked to them very often. I started to grow closer to Viviana and started to be more flirty. At us time it was lent (I went to catholic school) and my school had a little get together every Friday, this became the place where me hungout a lot and grew very close. After a few weeks I could tell for sure she liked me two and decided I would ask her out. Me being a scared of being rejected hinted and pretty much told her I was going to ask her out the next time I saw her. She said she liked me and had wanted me to ask her for the last two weeks. So friday roles around and I get all ready to ask her and she doesn't show up to the school party. I thought she was just busy so I just hungout, next week roles around she still didn't show up.  At this point dumb me thought she obviously doesn't like me and was being nice when she said she liked me back. And she had been skipping the parties because she didn't want me to ask her. So I started talking to this other girl Hayley and soon decided to ask her out and she said yes. We went out and eventually dated for a little bit but what I didnt realize was Viviana had just been busy with family problems. When she heard I started dating Hayley she hated me, I tried to say sorry and apologize but she hated my guts. Eventually me and Hayley broke up and after a but of time I tired to talk to Viviana, she would text me back and soon invited me to go to a lake with her. I thought this was a sign she had forgiven me but I was wrong. She ended up kissing another guy for half the time and rarely talked to me.  After this I realized she doesn't really like me anymore and we soon stopped talking. A few days before school ended I got a long text from her friend saying she really liked me, and how I broke vivianas heart when I just jumped to another girl. Now years later everything I see her post on Instagram or I am reminded of her, and I feel terrible because I know she still probably hates me.

"32/F: 32/M: Gonna sum this up pretty brief then I will go into more detail if anyone asks. My boyfriend of almost 3 years has cheated on me several times, twice I know for sure, but I have reason to believe that it has likely been a lot more than that. I know that this will not stop and plan to move on with my life. 
 I haven't done so yet but the biggest reason is I have children and I can't just up and leave without being prepared. The part I am struggling with is not to brag but I am a pretty awesome girlfriend, the only place in the relationship where he might be lacking is in the bedroom, because I am inexperienced, and after all that has happened in my life with him and previously I am very withdrawn and shy. (no excuse to cheat he could have talked to me, and helped me open up if he really cared). 
 My biggest problem is that I am having a really hard time trying to figure out the reason why he did it, he says he doesn't know which makes it even harder to get the closure I need to move on.  He continues to say that he doesn't want me to leave, and it's nothing I did wrong. So I'm guessing I need advice on a few things. One do any of you think that it's possible that he does really love me and want me, but has some kind of problem/addiction that makes him not be able to control?

"My older sister is a 28 year old relatively high functioning young woman with Down Syndrome, so I have a different perspective from most to offer. She is two years old than I am, but since she was held up in kindergarten and first grade, we went through school in the same grade for 12 years. With special ed classes and a tutor who went with her to the ""regular"" classes she took, she was able to graduate high school. She also had friends, mostly other students in special ed classes. She graduated high school, walking just ahead of me (oh alphabet). Although it required many accommodations, she was proud to have finished high school. 
 She now works at a movie theater, taking tickets and cleaning. She also volunteers at a hospital near our house, delivering intra-hospital mail. She really loves working at the theater especially, because she gets to watch movies for free after work. She works with a program for the mentally handicapped which teaches life skills, encourages healthy eating and exercise, and plans social outings (frequently bowling, she probably beats me when we go about 50% of the time but I am terribad). She is ""dating"" one of the guys in her program, but I'm not sure what that actually has entailed besides attending dances together. 
 While she has been in some ways a burden on the family, I am sure that nobody would want to get rid of her. Occasionally, I wonder what she would have been like ""normal,"" as my other two sisters and I are all pretty successful academically and in some other aspects of life. But I wouldn't want to change her, I think. She seems very happy living with my parents, working 2-3 days a week, watching lots of TV, coloring in geometric coloring books, and making friendship bracelets. She has had a profound effect on the people my other sisters and I became. We are more patient, compassionate, and less asshole-y than we probably would have been otherwise. 
 As for being a burden, she has limited my family in some ways. I don't know whether my mom intended to stay at home, but after my sister was born, that is what she did. It is likely, given the usual course of Down Syndrome, that she will not outlive my parents by much time at all. I don't really like to think about her dying, or my parents dying. But if she needs somewhere to be taken care of, she will come live with me and my wife (and honestly, this was kind of a litmus test while I was dating her, is that unfair?) or with my sisters. In fact, my parents told me that they were going to stop at two kids but felt that a third child (turned out to be twins) would help out with her once they died.","No, but I could understand saying yes.

"I am really sorry for the long text, but this is something i think is important and for some reason it felt good writing everything here down. 
 Okey so here's the deal. I am really really crappy at initiating tchnically anything, and everytime i do something for an extended period of time, i start out really psyched before i drop off and eventually stop.
I don't want to do that now. I want to lose weight. 
 Some basic info:
I was a swimmer until the age of 16 and after getting a job and moving on to greater schools while also being behind everyone else i decided to stop. I weighed around 55 kg at the time. I then thought about starting on a gym, and worked out perfectly, ran like the wind, lifted like a bau5 and were good at showing up 3-4 days a week.
Then that stopped... I lost all my training buddies, henceforth i did not have the motivation to go myself. 
 I then started an IT job where i ascended hard kilowise, i saw this early and got to use the gym at the school where i worked so i kind of stopped it after 65kg. (this is 1 year apart from stopping working out) 
 Then i got fired from that job and didn't have access to that gym anymore. I started working out with my brother at another gym, but he prefferred working out alone so that also stopped... Now i am at 100kg before i go into the Airforce for my 1 year service. Not a single kilo was lost or gained that year. Now it is 2 years after the airforce and i am currently weighing in a 120kg. 
And tbh... this sucks. 
 I need your help, i am sick and tired of just hearing ""just work out weekly/daily whatev, and eat healthy and you lose weight!"" YES that is fine! but what is working out? i go down and run for 2 hours and get utterly exhausted and hate everything? or i run around for 20 minutes at full speed? i lift weights, i do dips? what?
Eat healthy: all but vegetables every day? 3 full plates of salads everyday? 1 can of tuna and nothing else per week? these are not guidelines, they are general information everyone should know. 
 But i need more. I want more info, something i can follow, cheap recipes so i don't spend 50$ everyday on food. Easy and basic guidelines for how my workout SHOULD look for a week? 
 I really want to go into the double digits again, fat loss is primary atm and if i could EVER hit 80kgs i would be extremely please. 
 Thank you for reading all of this and i really hope for your cooperation in helping such a sad being as myself :P","I need more info on specific guidelines on losing fat, not just ""eat less, moe healthy and work out more""",27,M,loseit
"When I was 21 and looking to buy my first pistol I desperately wanted a PPK. Its one of my all time favorites and will always be. Its simply a gun I have to have in my lifetime. 
 Unfortunately when I turned 21 four years ago, everything I read about the PPK suggested that the build quality had gone way down because it was being produced by springfield (?) and not in Germany by Walther. I was disappointed, but couldn't shell out the money for an older, proven PPK. 
 Long story short I got a PPQ, love it to death, and never looked back until now. Now I have a job and money and I want a PPK. My question is have the reliability problems been cleared up? I heard something about Walther changing production with them, so I'm curious if this has been implemented and everything is right as rain again.

"Hello AskWomenAdvice. I've messed up, and I would appreciate some perspective on it. I'm going to change a couple of details so it's not too obvious who I am, and apologies for the wall-of-text, but I'm desperate. 
 I (19m) have been seeing my girlfriend (20f) for about a year and a half now, and things have always been great. Like, really great. She's my best friend, and I can honestly say that not only have I never been happier in my life, but, as a deeply good individual, she's honestly made me a better person. We've been abroad together, we've been there for each other when we've been ill, we've laughed and cried with each other, we've met each others families, and nothing worse has happened before now than a few minor spats. 
 Now, the fuck up. 
 I went for a night out with my housemate (my other bestfriend), a female friend and a guy from work. We all got incredibly drunk, to the point I don't remember large portions of the night. Someone suggested we go to the strip club. 
 I'd never been before this point, and I'm very uncomfortable as stripclubs (or, accurately, stripteases) was a major grey area in our relationships. We'd made jokes about it previously, but really I never expected to end up in this situation. 
 So, I get in, buy a couple of drinks, and resolve not to do anything stupid. After a while, I notice my friends alternating between talking to one of the girls working there and pointing at me. I can't work out what is going on. Next thing I know, I'm being grabbed by the hand and pulled off, the girl insisting that, as it's my first time, I had to have a dance. I don't particularly want one, but I'm already being pulled away, and frankly I felt pressured into paying $20 for a 3 minute dance. It was deeply uncomfortable, but I'm not going to pretend I couldn't have out my foot down and stopped it. 
 It gets worse. 
 My girlfriend was going through some incredibly tough times at her work, to the point that she was one step from bursting into tears on me when I saw her the next day. I'd resolved to tell her about the night before, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. It honestly would've crushed her at a time she really needed support. So, I told myself I'd tell her at the next best opportunity. The next day, she was even more stressed with deadlines, and people hounding her to do this and that. Another case of turning to me for support. I couldn't tell her when she was already crying into my chest. She told me she'd feel fine after her deadline in two weeks time for a big project, but until then she'd be seriously struggling. And she wanted to have sex with me. Rock and a hard place. Do I tell her now and crush her when she's already under severe pressure? Or act as if nothing is wrong for the time being and tell her when she has less on her shoulders, even if it means some shady behaviour? I went for the latter option. I'm ashamed to say I slept with her during this time period. Yeah, I know, it's fucking horrible what I did. 
 So, after this two week period, she invites me over. We chill out, have a chat, and I tell myself that now is the best time. I handled it badly - I wanted to get it off my chest and shoehorned it into the conversation. Worse, I panicked, and said some things I really regretted - I wanted to express that there was absolutely no desire or attraction to the dancer throughout, and that I couldn't even remember what she looked like. When she asked if the girl was better looking in a bit if dark humour, I repeated what I had heard from the others the morning after - that she was 'butters' and 'flat-chested'. Again, I panicked, and this is extremely out of character for me - enough that my girlfriend (an ardent feminist) now isn't sure that I'm the same person she thought I was, on top of not knowing if she can trust me. This is probably the thing I'm most ashamed of. 
 Somehow she let me stay the night, and I agreed to attend her production the day after. I did, we met up afterwards, had dinner, and went out for a bit afterwards. It honestly felt like we were back to normal. She said she forgave me - albeit she didn't entirely trust me, or love me quite as much (more dark humour). We laughed a lot, joked, smiled, kissed, and said goodbye before heading home for a few days. Our messages went back to normal. Now, as of the last day or so, her messages have suddenly changed back to being short, sparse, and she's told me that she is still hurting (fair enough, I expected as much) and implied that she still isn't sure if she's ready to keep seeing me. This blind-sided me as I thought we were back on at least talking terms. I understand that she hadn't had much time to process the info, but it was quite a shock to see such a turn around. 
 Here's the thing - I fucked up awfully. I. I acted badly, I handled it badly, and I followed through with it badly. My girlfriend means the world to me, and I'd give anything - literally anything - to turn back the clock a couple of weeks, put my foot down and say no. I guess I'm a lot weaker than I thought. I've made it very clear to her that I am deeply sorry, and that I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make our relationship work, including giving her plenty of time to think about what she wants to do. If she wants to break up with me, then fair enough; as she's a wonderful person who does not deserve such behaviour. But at the very least, I want her to know that, deep down, I'm a good person who made an awful mistake; the same person she's been in love with for the last year and a half, and that this monumental fuck up will never, ever happen again.","I love my girlfriend, but I got pressured into a strip-dance while blind drunk, and handled it badly.

"Don't read the below if you haven't read up to the end of ADWD: 
 I decided to roleplay as Ramsay Snow in the AFFC start date. I start off as the high lord of winterfell and notice pretty much everyone except my own family appear to have a -100 opinion of me (due to traits), so I act extremely quickly. To help consolidate my power, without any care in the world for 'rights', I merely attempt to revoke the nearest holding. Obviously this was refused, and the first rebellion occurred. 
 Around this time, I gained the random event, which converted Ramsay Snow from the old gods to the drowned god faith, which made it quite interesting. Upon defeating the first rebellion, I captured the first rebelling count and executed him by drowning. 
 For some reason, with the exception of my own wife, they thought this was tyrannical, and I couldn't even trust my spymaster. However, none of my remaining vassals really wanted to risk rebelling. Fearing an assassination plot, I remove my own spymaster from office, and decide a different approach. Every single non-vassal and non-wife in my court was imprisoned, until my entire court consisted of Ramsay, his wife, and an infant daughter. 
 Filled with glee by his new passtime, Ramsay Snow decided to drown every single one, gaining vast amounts of piety in the process. The remaining 4 counties were then subsequently revoked (not without fighting mind you), and every member of the nobility drowned. After the massacre, Ramsaw Snow was holding 12/2 over his demense size, and had over 1000 piety from drownings alone. 
 What a paragon of virtue! 
 Regardless with no courtiers to complain, and Ramsay Snow holding every single holding within the high lordship of winterfell, he was looking quite good. Despite the demense limit penalties, Lord Ramsay was still gaining income each month and had a large levy raised. 
 With the help of this levy, Roose defeated Stannis, an independence war, and an ironborn invasion. At the tender age of 33, Ramsay Snow succumbed to illness, and the playthrough ended (even though there was a daughter I could have continued as).","Ramsay becomes member of drowned god faith, drowns everyone.",33,M,CK2GameOfthrones

"In the end it probably won't matter because you will make your decision on your own but I'll still share a story with you. 
 A few years ago, when I was still in school I participated in a film project. Basically it was about documenting the day to day lives of german and israeli teenagers. So we traveled to Israel and used this opportunity to quit smoking. Back then I smoked every day, but not more than 2g a day. My life was pretty much in order, but I was aware of the fact that realistically, I would have to quit to finish school. 
 So it was this week in Israel, then coming back to Germany and just five days until school started again. I managed the whole trip brilliantly. Fuck withdrawals, fuck being in a new country and doing a film project. No problemo for this guy! Or so I thought. I managed everything pretty well but in hindsight I was so close to the edge the whole time. I even had a nervous break down just three hours before our flight back. I'm kinda rambling here so I'll get back to the point: 
 I did not know it consciously at that time, but the thought of not smoking until I finished school terrified me. So on day three of my trip I booked a trip to Amsterdam with a good friend. I thought that this week doesn't matter. It would be a short two day stay in Amsterdam and then I would have two more days to detox before school started again.
I mean come on, it's just a week, and after that last glorious trip I could just stop again. 
 We had our trip, I will spare you the details. It was fun but it also was just more of what I already knew. 
 When I came home I convinced myself that I could smoke until school started again. After all, hadn't I managed quitting so beautifully in Israel?
But when school started again, I did not quit. Or not for long. So it went for some time, I smoked, I went to school, I got by.
Until one day I felt I had to catch up. So much school, so much work, simply not enough time to smoke. To ""relax"". Me time. So I decided to skip school that day (which I rarely did) and stay home to smoke. And the next day I still did not feel satisified so I did it again. And again. And again. I never went back to school. Never called to say I would not show up again. There were rumours I died or ran away. 
 For the next eight or nine months I would smoke myself to the brink of psychosis. It got worse and worse. I smoked a lot. Everything else in my life stopped, it was just being in my room and smoking in front if my computer. Sometimes people visited me but it didn't matter. It was by far the worst time of my life. I could type this all out but this is long enough already. 
 To stop again I needed to go to detox. I couldn't do it on my own anymore. I had an insane week of withdrawals. Lost over 20 pound and had hour long episodes of panic and terror. Slept no more than three hours a night and woke up like I had jumped in a pool. Diarehaa and constipation. Headaches, pain in throat, chest, limbs and fingers. And a lot of other stuff I don't recall right now.

"My boyfriend is 26, I'm 24F, been together for 3 years and living together for almost the same time. 
 On to the heart of the matter: I think my boyfriend's mom is kind of clingy and intrusive, and when I try to speak to him about it, his response is pretty much ""I know she's clingy and intrusive, but you're an asshole for not turning a blind eye like I do"". He accuses me of not wanting them to have a relationship because I don't like her. I admit that I don't like her (she jumped to conclusions and called me a bitch, and when confronted about it she switched the story around to make it seem like she was talking about someone else and I misunderstood, and she plays the victim now) but that's neither here nor there. I don't mind if she visits her son at our home, I don't mind them hanging out together. I'm always courteous to her. 
 My issues are: Her dropping her in at 11 p.m. and beyond, dropping in without calling first, and wanting to party with us and our friends. Whenever she intrudes, she makes sure to bring along food or a gift for my boyfriend so that way I'm doubly an asshole for complaining about her just wanting to do something nice for her ""baby boy"" (by the way, my boyfriend has a younger brother that she NEVER refers to as anything other than his name). My boyfriend doesn't like the partying thing either, but he's too chicken to say anything. All he ever does is farm excuse after excuse to avoid talking to her about ANYTHING. He says he has talked to her about it and she won't change, but he never enforces anything. She keeps doing it because she knows he won't ever hold her to anything. He hardly ever acknowledges my complaints without a ""but"" attached, in which he shifts all blame on to me and paints me as a cruel jealous bitch that wants him to curse out his mom. I don't expect him to be mean or disrespectful to his mom or cut her out of his life, and I don't understand why he can't/won't talk to her adult to adult.

"Actually, it depends on what you mean by punishment. 
 Feeling that someone that you look up to (that you want to take pride in your actions) is disappointed with you after one of your actions hurts. I don't actually know what the emotion is called that you feel when someone you really think is the main component of your life is crushing your heart by telling you that you did something wrong enough to make them feel bad about you and perhaps their parenting, but it is a powerful one that makes you take a vow to yourself to never disappoint them again. 
 On the other hand, punishment like spanking, grounding, and the like only has a lasting effect of fear or ""if I do something wrong I get pain"". Most people are able to overcome that fear after a while and just don't care about the punishment anymore. 
 This is coming from a guy who got whipped by a belt, thumped on the head, spanked, grounded, and humiliated. By the time I was 15, I just didn't care about that anymore. I kept my good grades because I was worried about my own future, it took will power to not drop my grades as a sign of rebellion to my parents because I really wanted to. I didn't want them to believe that their parenting helped me be who I was, but I decided the risk was too big for the tiny reward of self-satisfaction. I was lucky in that respect, because it seems the majority of teenagers go through with the rebellion and screw up their futures as a way of getting back at their parents. 
 I'm 23 now with a 4.0 in college currently and my degree in Biochemistry is coming along nicely. I STILL have that lingering feeling that I need to call my parents together to tell them that I am not successful because of their punishments. I cried at night sometimes because I just wanted them to tell me that they were proud of me, or that I did a good job, or at least reward me with a thank you. I still remember the ONE TIME when my father told me ""thank you son"" after I helped stop him from falling off of a ladder. Nothing changed after that, and I decided to dedicate my life to helping others through science. I'm humbled and know I'm lucky that the downwards spiral that I wanted to play out in my head didn't come to fruition like it does with most teens today. The only reason I don't yell at my parents is because it would do nothing but give me some self-satisfaction on the expense of them feeling as if I was a jerk or they had done something wrong in raising me.","Make sure that you don't rely on punishment to raise your children. If it was an accident, don't punish them, just tell them why it was bad and not to do it again. If they hurt someone else or their property, punish them and make sure they know why it was wrong. Above all, make sure that your children KNOW that they are appreciated and thank them or reward them when they do hard work or get good grades. I also believe it is a good idea to have them read about the hard times that those in the past have felt. Narratives that help you live the experience of losing a family member due to the Holocaust instills a sense of righteousness in children, as long as it isn't cynical. 
 P.S. Seeings how I am only 23, I may seem a bit unqualified to give advice (and I know I myself still have a lot to learn), but I've babysat both family members and the children of friends in the past. I'm the go-to guy for babysitting because I apparently have a way of making children wanting me to babysit for them again. I try to use the same formula for ""parenting"" as I posted here (no punishments however, can't do that!) and the children really respond to being told ""Thank you little guy!"" or ""That some great work!""",23,M,funny

"Being a SAHM is absolutely a respectable life choice. But I see that you're only sixteen, and I feel the need to offer some thoughts (hopefully in a more constructive way than your family has). This comment is likely to be buried at the bottom, but I'm really just writing it for you, OP. 
 First of all: as much as I know you feel your current SO is going to be your husband and the father of your children, the reality is that you both still have a lot of changing and growing to do. Almost everyone (myself included) has been there, has had the high school sweetheart they think they're going to marry. But almost everyone also becomes an entirely different person after just one year of college—not in a bad way, but certainly in many ways. You simply have no way of knowing right now if you guys will still be compatible when you're actually ready to get married. You absolutely might be, but don't mentally lock yourself to that idea yet. Allow it as a possibility, but not the  only  possibility. That'd be unfair to yourself. Let yourselves grow and change freely, and don't be afraid to accept it if you grow apart. You still have hundreds upon hundreds of people to meet in your life, and chances are you will be smitten with many of them. 
 Secondly: As I said before, there is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to be a SAHM one day. It is a wonderful, respectable thing to do. My mom did it until I was in middle school and to this day I adore her for it. But you have to realize that being a SAHM is  always  an option . . . but getting your foot in the door of the professional world and getting some experience while you're young isn't. My mom worked as an engineer for 10 years before she decided to be a SAHM, and it allowed her to go back to work and help when my parents ran into strained financial times. And now that they're empty-nesters, it lets her contribute to their approaching retirement.

"On the internet. When I was 13 I was messing around in different chatrooms, where I started talking to an american kid. The kid said he knew a guy from the same country as me and he started inviting this third person to our MSN chats. We added eachother on MSN, talked online for four years, until we realized I live half an hour away. 
 I took a train to meet him, hang around for a day and we sort of clicked. This was december 7th 2009. It was december 23rd 2009 that he texted me saying ""yeah I had to tell my family something since it's weird saying we're just 'friends with benefits' so I guess you're my girlfriend now"". And that's how we're still together 4 years later, talking about marriage and kids. We moved to a different country together (here now) and when we're moving back we plan on driving through Europe, spening two weeks doing that (Ireland->Norway).

"I'm a 26 year old male working as materials engineer.

She's also my sister's [24F] roomate though they aren't that close. 
 I was using her laptop the other day and went on reddit where she was still logged in. I knew she was a redditor but naturally we kept our accounts secret from eachother. Without thinking I clicked on the orange mail flag assuming it was mail for me and there were several comments in Ghazi agreeing with a nasty over the top comment she made. Probably not the best idea but I clicked her username and her posts were 80% ghazi 15% circlebroke 5% srs and 100% frightening to see from someone you love. Not because of the idea behind them but because of how mean the comments are. 
 Not wanting to be dishonest I called her over and told her I saw it. She wasn't mad at first but she asked what did I think about gamer gate and reddit in general. I said I don't care about video games and that reddit is a decent site and she got pissed. She began to ask me if I was mysoginistic and that it explained a lot. I then decided to go further out and said that some of her comments were a bit much and that she shouldnt ivest herself into an internet war. She got mad and asked me to leave. 
 This was 3 days ago and I thought she'd be normal again by christmas but she seemed a bit distant still when I was texting her from out of town at my dad's place [68M].

"Hi. My wife [32] wants me [36] to find a FWB for myself.  We have a terrific, amazing sex life with lots of kinky fun and all that, but she feels it would be a major turn-on for her if I would have sex with another woman and come home to tell her about it. 
 Very much a ""hothusband"" type of scenario. 
 Problem is, I don't know if that's something I want to do. I want our sexual experiences to be shared ones.  We've agreed to try a threesome (we've had several women approach us - I attribute much of that to my wife's awesomeness), for example, but are holding out for the right partner/opportunity. 
 If I'm understanding correctly, she wants me to get this FWB so that they can be integrated into our relationship for a longer-term three-way hookup situation, and that's fine, but me going out and finding some girl to have sex with is just off-putting to me for some reason. 
 I'm experienced sexually (not to say I'm a total slut, but I've had my share of casual erotic encounters), and I'm more than sure I could do this deed, but I'm just kind of conflicted. 
 I want to make her happy, but I'm worried that she's not going to enjoy the result as much as she thinks she will.

"background: i am 17 andmy parents dont know i smoke so i have to keep my smoking a secret, but they are fully aware of my brothers smoking habits though) I was coming home from smoking at my girlfriends, i was at a 6. when i came home my mom was downstairs waiting for me which seemed kind of odd. i said hi and tried to act normal. after a brief coversation she went into the kitchen and asked me to follow. when we went in the kitchen my favorite pipe ""spyro"" was sitting on the counter and i knew i was fucked.
 i tried to act like i couldnt tell while my mind raced for an explanation. i quickly said my brother had left it in his room and i was holding it for him (he lives about an hour away at my dads house) which she didnt believe. i didnt back down though and stuck to my story. i went upstairs to confront my stepdad and tell him my story. he then said he didnt believe me and pulled out a bowl that i must have left in my hiding spot and forgot about. so then i start to think that im fucked again.
i told them that it was my brothers as well and i was planning on throwing it away but i was too sketched to transport it through the house. (to this day my stepdad still doesnt believe me). my brother worked the nightshift so there was a good chance that he was working at that time but my mom decided to call him. i then for the third time thought i was fucked. thankfully he didnt pick up so i sent him a text telling him to go with whatever they say. but me stepdad picked up on me texting and put two and two together so i tried deleting the message before he looked at my phone. so now for the 4th time i thought i was fucked. but the gods shined upon me and the messages finished erasing right as he took my phone.

"This has been bothering me for about 6 months now, and I still don't know how to feel about it. Basically I left my ex around 4 months ago after over 2 years of being happily in a relationship. The reason for that was trust. I couldn't trust her. She made me so paranoid and then blamed it all on me, that it was all in my head. She denied it all and made me feel like I was insane and that it all was inside my head. I still feel unsure about everything, I'm having a hard time trusting people etc. Anyways, I'll get on with what pretty much happened over the time, hope someone has time to read what I have to say. 
 Basically, all the problems started before we actually were ""officially"" in a relationship. She had this guy, a very good friend of hers. It was more like a FWB type of thing though, and she had apparently had feelings for him at some point at least, but he never wanted anything serious. Between the beginning of our dating and our official relationship thingie they still had something going on. They did have sex once, and casual making out and such. GF told me after about a year, which was quite odd to me. I thought that I should probably be careful with this guy. 
 Took a few months again, AFAIK they didn't hang out or anything anymore, nothing. Everything was just great. My GF did have a habit of being very flirty with other guys (we'll get back to this later). Then his old FWB was in contact again. I didn't like it at all, but she just told me they're really good friends. And one evening she was drinking with him and some other friends of hers. Well, apparently this guy had been talking a lot of shit about me, trying to make me look  really  bad. Also tried making out with my GF, and from what I heard from her she didn't answer the gesture. What also made me feel quite bad was that her friend was encouraging her to cheat on me for a few months. Yet my GF kept on hanging out with that friend of hers who wanted my GF to cheat on me. 
 Later on, a few other guys came along. My GF was extremely flirty with them, especially when I wasn't around. All of this I heard from her friends (some of them who are very good friends of mine as well). She denied it all. Thoughts were running through my head, I was wondering if I'm just really too paranoid. I constantly heard about my GF flirting and being intimate with several guys. Anything within the limits of touching genitals or kissing. She kept going on, denying it all. She even did that at her own party when I was just behind one door throwing up in a bucket. She was taking care of me for five minutes. Her friends took care of me for several hours and told me that she's doing it again. 
 This went on with her ex-FWB and some other guys for some time. Then I just had it. She kept hanging out with that ex-FWB of hers really often. He constantly came up with ways to see my GF (they were neighbours, so that gave him the advantage). I  knew  he wanted sex from her and I mentioned that to my GF. She denied it as well, telling me he just wants to be friends. After a while, I decided that I've had it. I talked to her on the phone, she was hanging out just with him at her place. Of course knowing what he had been trying for many, many months and all the history they've had I just didn't tolerate it. The next day I went to her place, told her that that it's over unless she stops seeing him. She didn't choose me. 
 After the break-up I did a lot of talking with me and my ex-gf's mutual friend, who has been one of my best friend for years now. It was devastating to find out how within minutes of me leaving her place after breaking up with her she went and had sex with that ex-FWB of hers. She also had told her friends she had known what he wanted all along. We were good friends with my ex after the break-up. Still, she lied to my face more than ever. To me, she said we still have a chance to work it out. To her friends, she told the opposite. Then followed the most dick move she could do. She started spreading a rumour to people (we have LOTS of mutual friends) that I had been violent towards her and hit her. I still have no idea how many people believe her, but I've made it clear with lots of people. Then again, she told most of our mutual friends, her family etc. 
 I just can't believe how she could do all that. All that time I thought she would be the love of my life, the perfect girl for me. I loved her with all my heart, shared all of my secrets with her (even one I've never told my parents or anyone else) and did everything to be loyal to her. I still feel that I'm not enough. Not for her, not for anyone. My self-esteem has always been terrible. This has made it so much worse. I've been drinking like fuck every weekend after the break-up and it feels like it's the only thing keeping me going. I have no motivation in anything and I constantly feel paranoid of the fact that people think of me as someone who beats women up. Who'd believe me, anyways? 
 A month after the break-up she also met this guy and a week after meeting him they're together. At first when seeing her at parties and such she went and made out with him right in front of me on purpose and she's still doing that at times. I just don't get the point. Everyone thinks that's awfully done by her as well, seeing how we had quite a long relationship and she just jumps into a new one right away ditching everything I had with her. Didn't feel good either, no.. 
 We sometimes talked about how if we'd break up it'd go on without a fight and we'd stay best friends. I believed in it. What I believed in even more was that I would spend the rest of my life with her. She told me the same things. The best experiences I had ever had were with her. Then she just smashed it all to bits. I feel crushed, reddit. Helpless with all of this. I'm just hoping someone would bother reading my wall of text, maybe relate, maybe have advice for me. If not, at least I have all of this typed out.","Seriously, read the whole thing.

"Hi Reddit. 
 I'm in my 2nd Semester of my Freshman year living away from home on Campus. 
 When I first moved out here, I was very outgoing and willing to be friends with everyone I met. I lived on a freshman quad and always introduced myself to whomever new was with my ""friends"" (acquaintances) in hopes of making another ""friend"". In class, I had no problem looking over to the person next to me and saying, ""Hi, my name is embarassingthroaway. Nice to meet you, how do you like this class, etc. etc."" to start conversation which was hopefully followed by another new acquaintance. After highschool, I realized it really didn't matter what people thought of me considering I don't see anyone from my highschool (aside from my close friends who I will talk about later in this post) at all anymore. So I thought I'd try my best to be who I've always wanted to be. Outgoing, friendly, funny, nice, and sarcastic [the thing that makes me, ME. Though, I'm being entirely serious in this post]. 
 Eventually, one of my acquaintances introduced me to my now current girlfriend. I get along with her better than anyone else I've dated before. She understand my sense of humor and gets the way I think. Needless to say, I'm VERY happy with her. 
 Half way through the first semester, though, I was moved to an Upper class man quad on the other side of campus. My new room mate didn't actually sleep here and planned on moving out at the end of the semester. He slept at his girlfriend's place and spent an extremely minimal amount of time, simply studying or just browsing on his computer for a short time, at all in the room. He was a drug dealer, so he was always busy. 
 Seeing how this is an upper class man quad, everyone already has their cliques and friends carved out. There's really no room to knock on my neighbor's door (if they're ever around) and ask them how they're doing. So I found myself spending a lot of time on the computer. Keeping to myself, playing video games with my close friends from highschool, retreating to my highschool state of mind again (Not anti-social, but no drive to be social). 
 I stopped going downtown and partying (mainly to save money) and decided to spend my weekends with my girlfriend. Now, we stay in every weekend and stream a movie, or play video games (she plays a mean street fighter :P). I only really kept in contact with 2 friends from my freshman quad. Nobody else ever texted back, or commented back on facebook, or anything else. 
 So here I am, in the middle of my second semester. I'm sitting in my room with my new drug addict (heh coincidence) room mate that leaves the TV on blast so he can fall asleep at night. I was rummaging through facebook and find that atleast 5 of my ""friends"" from the first semester unfriended me. And another 5 won't reply to anything I put on their wall. Most of them haven't bothered replying to texts, and it's really out of the way [and awkward] for me to trudge across campus to say ""HEY Y U NO BE FRIENDS WITH ME ANYMORE?"". 
 With that in mind, I'm having that much more trouble bringing myself to say even ""Hi"" to the random person next to me in any of my lecture classes. I'm afraid that they'll just ignore me and it'll be pointless anyway. 
 I miss my friends from home. I know I shouldn't limit myself to them, but they relate to me hell of a lot more than anyone of these new people I'm meeting.","I'm sick of meeting new people and finding out if you move a little ways away, they'll completely ignore you.

"Hi. First time posting on reddit. First of all, I'm sorry for the grammar and mispells, english isn't my native language. And sorry if I make any mistake. 
 So, I met this girl in 2010. We were kids, basically(13 years old, both of us). We were close to each other, she liked books, I liked books, we had some interests in common. I'll just try to summarize everything. In 2011, I fell in love with her. I had never fallen in love with someone the way I fell with her. So I told her, and we started a relationship(yes, we had 15 years old, I know, some will say it's nothing important). At first, she was with me just to forget a boy she had been having feelings for, but after some months, she truly started to love me. 
 So we got very close. She had very serious self-esteem problems and I was the person that helped her the most. Some would say she's fat; I say she's perfect. I just love her, you know? The point is, we were really, really close to each other. We spent all day long talking to each other, and every weekend, we would go out to see movies. 
 Thing is, in the end of 2013, I got some doubts about my feelings. It wasn't the first time, and she noticed it. So she broke up with me, wanting to give me time to think about my love for her. I ended up not wanting to get back with her, when she came to talk to me again after 2 months(February 2014). It's the biggest regret I have. Really, the thing that I want the most is just to go back in time and not let her go away. It was really bad for her, but she had her friends and her family, and she travelled to a foreign country, so thinking about me wasn't something she would do all the time. 
 So, after 4 months of our breakup(April, 2014), she searched me again, wanting a ""friend with benefits"" type of relationship. Yes, we had had sexual activities. Nothing really serious, two young persons knowing each other. So I accepted because... I liked to be with her. And I ended up falling in love with her again, and she still loved me, so we got back together. And I thought that this time it was serious. 
 Wasn't. I mean, it was serious. But just not as strong as before. She started to get distant. I always had to search for her, she almost never looked for me. Watching her TV series seemed to be more important for her than I was. She wouldn't charge her cellphone, so I couldn't talk with her. I'm very possessive, I admit. I don't like to stay one day without talking with her; it just makes me nervous. I don't know. 
 So, I felt like I was loving her, but she wasn't loving me back. She kept telling me that she did love me, she was just different. And I believed her. I thought that I just had to get used to not getting so much attention. 
 Two weaks ago, she broke up with me. One day before our last year of school began. It wasn't a agressive breakup, because I understood her point. She still loves me, and I know it. Our connection is really strong. But she loves me as a friend. Something like that. Aaand, she felt feelings for the boy that she was trying to forget when we started dating. So... I really wouldn't like to be with her knowing she liked another guy. 
 I'm trying to move on. But I still love her. Like, I really don't have any will to live without her. I totally understand we HAD to breakup, things weren't working out. But I miss her. And I'm young, and I know I have a lot to live. Still... It's hard, without her. It's really hard to wake up, knowing I won't have her with me. And I see her everyday, because of school. 
 And what kills me is that she's fine. She's moving on. In some time, she will probably know another guy. And I wont be the last anymore. She's fine, and i'm just... I don't have a place to go. I don't have anyone to talk to. I'm just alone. Loneliness is killing me. 
 And I feel it's my fault. If I hadn't broken up with her the first time, if I could just love her and stop being stupid, things would the fine now. She would still love me. 
 I really don't know if I made it clear to you what the situation was. I'm sorry, i'm really confused too... Thank you for reading.","Girlfriend ended a 3 years relationship.

"Im a 23 year old girl in a big city, and I'm pretty typical. Stable home, cool siblings, modern lifestyle. Nothing about me screams ""immoral slut"". Except John. 
 I met John in university when I was dating his friend. John and I had an immediate connection and it very quickly took over what I felt for his friend. We would talk for hours about any and everything. The mental and physical connection we have is indescribeable. Emotionally, however, there was never much there. We both realized soon enough that we had a thing for watching each other get off and we shared a mutual love for all things Tantra. I'll make this simple: With all of our other partners, we had to learn how to have an orgasm, ie: actively think about and focus until we came. With each other, it was the opposite. We had to fight to not orgasm a minute or so in. We are two sides of the same coin it seemed, our energy was parallel... even intertwined.

I sure I'm misinterpreting a lot of stuff on here (and elsewhere), but it seems like most of the issues these types of tragedies bring up are social, which paradoxically may not be the easiest things to change in the minds of the types who do this stuff. 
 Obviously our culture informs the entitlement, and warped perception of others these men unilaterally possess, but mainstream culture seems to be, in the humble opinion of this neckbeard, against things like rape and murder (at least nominally), so the red pillers and internet racists and MRA's retreat to insular circle jerks and egg each other on. Even if we miraculously fixed our mainstream perception and policies toward gender relations and violence and all that, how do you convince an isolated, miserable person that has had to look so far and wide for a source of self esteem or at least an outlet for the anger that they've latched on to Nazism or red pill rhetoric to let go of the one thing that lets them feel not quite as bad?

"I worked Saturdays in a coffee house in 2009 whilst I was in Sixth form College in order to pay for the tube and to have a little extra as I was now old enough to go to the pub etc. My boss was no better or worse than any of my friends bosses seemed to be but after he got caught cheating his girlfriend broke up with him and he became intolerable, stinking of alcohol and yelling at us for pretty much any reason and taking out his problems on the staff. We knew he had been holding back tips, probably for more booze so we lost any sympathy and respect we had left. Because of this some of us started taking our lunch hour at the pub down the road from us rather than stay in the cafe where he would ruin that too. 
 When we were in the pub football would pretty much always be on. Like most people, I had always passionately supported England and watched every minute of the World cup and Euros (my favourite players then were Rooney and Terry hah) but had never really been into club football because I didn’t have access to sky and had been too young to drink in pubs before then. My friend was a Chelsea fan so for his sake I said I’d support them but really had no intention of getting into football in my 2nd year of college with all my studies. 
 Now the first PL game that I can say I actually watched was Arsenal Portsmouth. I only got to watch the first half before I had to go back but I remember seeing two sweet goals from Diaby that had definitely been team goals. I can’t say I particularly cared but I have to thank the footballing gods for letting me witness beautiful stylish football before I watched anymore matches so I could later realise that other teams did not possess the class Arsenal did. I never got to watch the second half because we had to go back to work but for the first time ever I bothered to watch Match of the day to see what happened and funnily enough remember being pissed that Diaby got injured near the end because I was hoping he’d be playing next time if Arsenal happened to be on again. I guess the footballing gods or shall we just say Bergkamp and Henry, were letting me know what I would be in for with Diaby. 
 I didn’t understand how the league worked because I had only ever watched knock out tournaments like the world cup but my Chelsea friend knew the good fixtures and started scheduling our breaks so that we could catch at least the majority of a match. I was glad next week’s game was Arsenal again especially because it was against United and even though I wouldn’t say I hated them then I knew that they were the go to glory hunter team to support so it was fun to cheer for who I thought must be the underdog. I was surprised that I wanted to cheer when arshavin (I remembered him from the world cup because I found his name amusing... I was a teenager) scored an absolute rocket against them. I wasn’t used to cheering and was a bit shy still but went back to work happy although I later learnt from MOTD that Arsenal lost by a few goals in the second half. 
 This carried on for a couple of months and I was lucky that there were quite a few Arsenal games on Saturdays and I eventually told my Chelsea friend I preferred Arsenal, almost feeling a little bad because he had tolerated noob question after question. Eventually though my work took an interesting turn of events. On Haloween my boss came to work in an absolute state and fired my Chelsea friend (It later turned out he had given away a free drink to a female mystery shopper because she was hot lol) and they had a huge bust up so he was extra pissed off that day and dickish to me. He had to shut up shop early because we were now short staffed. Although I could have gone home I went to the pub for lunch as usual and after being there for about 20 minutes got to witness the greatest few minutes of football I had seen so far; it was the derby against Tottenham (who I recently learnt were our arch rivals) and Van Persie scored a goal a few minutes before half time to give us the lead. I finally felt comfortable cheering because my friend wasn’t there and I didn’t really care what strangers thought. Even better was realising my boss was in the same pub watching on another screen and swearing his head off to anyone who would listen. I thought I would go over because it would have been awkward if he realised I had seen him and stayed where I was but just after I said hi, Fabregas had somehow already owned the entirety of spurs and scored again! I instinctively cheered and only then realised that my boss was a Tottenham fan as he got up and left without saying anything to me. I quit pretty soon after because it was shit without my friend but will always be grateful for lucky scheduling, an overly horny friend and my boss being enough of a cunt that it made Arsenal seem pretty much destined for me.","My boss turned into a dick so me and my mate started taking our lunch breaks away from the cafe and in the local pub.

"sorry but this is a throwaway account) 
 I am 19f and my boyfriend is 23.  We met almost 2 years ago through a friend.  Everything had been going great until I found out that i was pregnant last week.  When I told my boyfriend that I was pregnant I was expecting him to encourage me to have an abortion, which is what I am wanting but didn't feel right about just doing it and not telling him first.  The reaction I got was the complete opposite.  He is happy about it and was mad that I would want to abort it.   I'm not ready to be a mother.  I have just started college and I really want to finish it and start a career before having a family.  This is his last year of college,  he has a college job but nothing yet for afterwords.  I really think this is a bad time for either of us to start a family. 
 Is it wrong for me to still want an abortion even though he wants the child.  I know that most likely it will mean the end or our relationship if I go through with it. Need advice/help.  (please if you are just going to say that ""if your not ready to have kids, then you shouldn't have sex"" don't bother to reply.

"Long story short: we (both mid 20s) dated/lived together for a 2.5 years and split up when she asked for a break (I have since learned what that actually means) a little over a year ago. She moved back home from the city we had moved to together and started seeing this guy (an old flame she had just recently gotten back into contact with before our break up) a few months later. 
 For many reasons, I ended up back home as well, and while her and I aren't ""friends,"" things are cordial when we see each other. As we have similar circles of friends, it has come to my attention that he has hooked up with at least two girls over the summer who were under the impression that they had broken up (because he told them so), but ended under shady circumstances. As we weren't close anymore, I assumed that this was true. However, she just recently posted on the various social medias about their ""anniversary,"" which would lead one to assume that no such break-up occurred this summer. 
 Although she may have broken up with me under less than ideal circumstances, I don't wish her ill will. However, is it not my place to tell her what I know?","Ex asked me for a break, started dating dude immediately after. Found out he's been hooking up with other girls.

"Hi Reddit. Thanks for your time. Im sorry im not English so please bear with me. 
 I am 24(m) and have been going out with my girlfriend (22) for just less than four years. Everything was great until about the time we became sexual during the first few months. We were each others first partners but i was more experienced than her, in terms of knowing what to do. She was clueless. I did not think much about this as i thought she would learn. She did learn, but not as much as you would expect from a girl of her age and intelligence. For example she still uses her nails during a handjob which hurts a lot. She is like a dead animal in bed and not very creative etc 
 A few nights ago i was fingering her and doing oral which she was loving but when i spread her legs more to do what she loves she said it felt like i was examining her. This was a boner killer for me and i just stopped and slept. I know all about her body, what she likes, what she doesnt and what turns her on, but i am pretty sure she hasnt put in much effort in exploring mine. 
 Tonight she came over and i made one of our favorite meals. After eating we started watching a movie sitting in bed. She got my dick out and began giving me a hand-job which sucked. It was dry and was beginning to get painful when i hinted for her to stop. I was annoyed at the fact that she does not put effort into doing anything sexual properly even though we have talked about it. She then faced away from me. The movie finished and she decided she wanted to go home. I asked her why she was mad at me at the door she didnt answer. I then sent her a text. The reply i got was painful. She said in her words, ""Am fed up of making all the effort."" I replied saying, ""I do nothing?"" and the most painful was when she said ""Not to b wiv me."" It felt like a knife to the heart.","I got annoyed at girlfriend of 4 years as she doesnt put much effort in her knowledge about sex for our benefit.

"Ok... I need to talk to someone else besides my partner and need the help of all you lovelies on TwoX... 
 So....I'll give a bit of a depressing and frustrating (for me) background first. I'll just lay it out on the table: when I was a kid I was sexually abused by a very close family member. The abuse lasted about 3-4 months and my family visited this family member almost every weekend. I hadn't hit puberty yet and it was a very, very, very confusing time in my life. 
 The reason I need to vent is because that family never died this week and I feel terrible that I'm happy... My mom is absolutely devastated because the person that passed was in her immediate family. While she knows what happened to me, she still felt a bit sad to cut ties with the abuser because they were diagnosed with cancer. Now I feel bad because I can't really make my mom feel better without feeling like crap myself. 
 I feel like such a mean person to be happy at the death of someone who was supposed to care for me. It's a very confusing and frustrating situation. I really feel bad for my partner, too because he doesn't even know what to do... Ugh.. I feel happy, disgusting, relieved, and shell shocked all at the same time... I don't even want to go to the funeral because I couldn't bring myself to see their lifeless body and hear people say how great of a person they were. To me, this person was terrible.... I could really use some support and maybe some guidance... The other thing that sucks is I can't afford to see a specialist because my insurance through my mom sucks (I'm 23) and I just lost my temp job that was paying the bills. I just don't know what to do or what to say to my mom... What do I do, TwoX?",I was sexually abused by a family member and I'm happy that they died this week.

"Not sure how many people read one and not the other here, but figured I need as much help as I can get...I really care about her and do not want to screw this up. 
 I (23M) broke up with my ex girlfriend (22F) about six months ago because I'd received a job overseas and she was going to be entering her senior year of university. 
 Six months of time has given me some perspective on the relationship, and about a month ago, I started to miss her. So I reached out and contacted her. 
 Two things about our prior relationship: it was primarily long distance (different colleges during the school year, but together during the summer), but we were close enough that we saw each other relatively frequently on weekends too. Additionally, during much of the time we'd dated, she had been clinically depressed and eventually it took its toll on me. I hate admitting this, but I felt worn out, and couldn't imagine how I'd be able to handle an even longer distance relationship with her. Again, six months gives some perspective, and I can now see that I misjudged her. I, for whatever reason, wasn't able to stop seeing her as depressed, even though she really had been for some time. 
 Contacting her felt like (and feels like) the right thing to do. We've been talking a bit now, and my feelings have grown. I know she still has feelings for me, (she's admitted as much), but she doesn't know whether there's a future for us. 
 I agree that the timing isn't ideal, but I'm finishing my assignment in a few months, and will be home over the holidays.

"I've played ultimate for the last 5 years, but the extent of which I played really only ranged from pickup games to intramural play. As such, it was only recently that I started to pick up on ultimate terminology that had to do with actually implementing strategy. Some strategy comes natural at any level of play, like the use of dumps, swings or deep cuts, but I had never been exposed to stacks or zone offenses/defenses until recently. 
 I'm now a freshman at University of Georgia and I play fall and spring ultimate on a really good intramural team, winning the last two campus championships. Compared to the level of competition I read that you guys compete in, it's really nothing to boast about, but still I feel like because of our success as a team I believe that we definitely have the handlers and mids necessary for actually trying out some stacks. 
 While I do enjoy winning, I really play ultimate because I like to see myself and my teammates get better. I feel like my team could easily handle the idea of running specific, set offenses, but as of now it doesn't really seem necessary due to the fact that our natural rhythm of play seems to be working fine.","I play on a good team, we win without strategy.

"Just wanted to say thanks to all of you who showed concern over my well being. Much love. I'd kiss all of you but, internet. But anyways my first post is here 
and btw, I'm 17. I just turned 17 a week ago and still getting used to acknowledging I'm now a year older. 
 So I took some of your guys advice which was to talk to my mom. But I had no luck in getting my points across. I was lectured about how the xbox makes me a violent person. And after I tried explaining I needed help, she ignored it and continued lecturing me saying I needed to stop trying to act like an adult. And then continued to lecture me on how the devil is tied into all of the violent games I play. And then the whole time I kinda just sat there and listend. I did kind of ignored most of it since she wasn't understanding what was going on. But here go the subtitles. 
 Mom- ""You're only 17 adrian. In less than 11 months, you're going to be 18, in college, and no longer here. And you think your roommates will tolerate this behavior?"" 
 Me- ""No."" 
 ""Then why do you act like this towards me. I am your mother and I deserve your respect. The door is replacable. But the words you used towards and against me are not."" 
 "" I didn't mean any of it. I was just mad-"" 
 ""Mad because I took your xbox?"" 
 ""No I was mad because I don't know. I freaked out. Normally I would just go upstairs. I don't remember punching the door. And the whole time I was yelling at you, I was just yelling just to yell. I had no motive. Normally I would just shrug it off but I just ticked. And I'm sorry. I didn't mean it when i called you stupid."" 
(My father was a verbal abusive guy and an alcoholic and always called her names which is why she hates it. She always compares me to my father which makes me even more mad at times. I don't even know the fucking guy.) 
 ""And you call me bipolar. You have 3 younger brothers, how do you think they will respond to this. They look up to you. You're they're father and they're going to grow up fucked up seeing you act like this."" 
 (I think It might be genetics at this point. We are all fucked.) 
 I apologized and then went to bed since I had work in the morning. She said she would try contacting a therapist. Hopefully she does. Now it's the next day. Today. Hand is swolen, don't really want to encounter any other human beings. But If I don't I'll get fired and I need to buy a new door. 
 Im at work, and my manager asks what happened. I tell her I got into a fistfight with my door. She's a bit sarcastic which I enjoy cause it's funny and she asks me if I won. I laugh and say I punched it in half.  And then the rest of the day is pretty much the same. 
 I'm still mad at myself. I down really have much will to do anything at the moment. I just really want to go to the gym and blow off some steam. But I know my wish won't get granted since everyone at home is pretty much avoiding eye contact with me. I'm overeating again. I just ate 3 bags of Jack links beef jerky. And then water of course. I don't know what to do now. My crush asked what happened and I refused to tell her about it. I can't bring myself to talk about it anymore because it makes me more upset.

"This is about the most complex situation I've found myself in.  I met a girl online in October of last year.  It started out as us helping get each other off, but progressed into us actually getting to know each other.  The more we talked the harder we both fell.  About 4 months after meeting her online I flew from Michigan to the UK where she lives to meet up with her for about 10 days.  While we were there, we acted like a couple but once I left things kind of hit the fan for a bit. 
 She was mad that I was excited to leave (I'm very close to my friends and family and missed them).  She also was confused and frustrated that I didn't want to say we were together.  She wrote me an e-mail saying she couldn't do it any more and we stopped talking for two months. 
 I was devastated.  If I'm being 100% honest, the situation scared the shit out of me and I wanted to give her an early out so that I wouldn't get hurt.  In my mind I felt that the situation worked out fairly well for me but didn't work for her.  I'm a PhD student, I knew that I would be moving 3 to 4 times in the next 3 to 4 years for jobs.  The odds of me starting a lasting relationship during that time in my mind were low.  But for her, I felt like her being interested in me meant she would be passing up on opportunities. 
 Eventually we started talking again but without the over sexuality.  Occasionally things would slip out about desire for one another.  I'd always not attend to it.  I wanted to be her friend and wanted to be there for her.  We did both understand that the feelings were mutual.  I think if one of us had the courage to say ""I love you"" the other would be willing to return it. 
 Over the past 5 months or so our relationship has been building up again.  It's more or less everything except the sex.  The problem is due to my work schedule, her work schedule and time differences we only get to talk 1 hour a night on weeknights typically and sometimes one of us is busy for that. 
 Anyways, the other night she went on a date.  I was encouraging and told her I'd be jealous but I'm happy for her (this happens whenever one of us goes on a date).  This felt different though, things had been different between us lately and I found this one hurt.  I tend to be someone who's more pragmatic than emotional but this dysregulated me to the point of being nausea. 
 We talked afterwards and we spoke about the impact it had on me.  The pragmatic issues of distance, and that ultimately we both want to be in a local relationship.  However last night as I was thinking I realized a few things.  I only look for dates after I hear of her getting someones number or thinking about it and I don't want to be in a local relationship, I want to be in a local relationship with her.  I also realize that I care about this woman so much that I just want her to be happy and that I'm starting to worry that my trying to meet her needs might be leading her to speak up about if she would want to just try to figure out things with me in some way shape or form.  I have a lot going on in life right now and it's making it rather hard to be level headed about this.  I could really use some insight, suggestions, advice, or support.",Girl who lives far away went on a date that went really well.

"So this happened about 3 hours ago but the buying of the sweatpants happened yesterday.  It's a story with a happy ending but here it goes! 
 So Yesterday I was at the mall, and I bought some sweatpants from H&M.  These sweatpants were awesome but had very small pockets. 
 So fast forward to Sunday (today).  It is my Dad's birthday and he decides to take myself (16) and my 2 brothers (2) and (7) to Dave & Busters for dinner and some video games.  I decide to wear my new sweatpants because WHY NOT?  So I am playing one of those games where you shoot the basketball.  Before I started playing I tapped my pocket to check if my phone was there.  It was.  So I started playing.  When I was done I took one of the basketballs and started juggling it like a soccer ball because I am just like soccer.  Yeah i'm that guy...  So the ball rolls 15 feet away and I chase after it and get it back.  I check to see if my phone is in my pocket and it is not their anymore.  I check the area in which I just was and no luck.  Someone stole my phone from the ground. 
 I quickly rush to my dad, take his phone and sign into Find my iPhone.  It won't load it's location because of the terrible connection in Dave & busters.  So I just start spam calling my phone to see if anyone answers or makes any sudden movements in their pockets.  In the meantime their is one specific person I am searching for.  This really sketchy girl was watching me play basketball when I lost my phone.  So I see her as I am calling my phone and she doesn't move towards her pockets are make any look towards me so I assume it isn't her. 
 So I go outside Dave & Busters and try to get a location on my phone as their is good service outside.  I see that my phone is in a parking lot near we parked on the side of the building.  I run over their and start looking for people about to leave and keep updating the location of my phone.  About a dozen people leave and my phone remains in the same location.  I start looking in the parking lot street.  I come up with nothing.  After about 30 minutes of being outside searching for my phone (btw its 30 degrees out and all i have is a hoodie on, im fuckin freezing my dick off)  I go inside and play some games until it is time to go. 
 So my Dad, and brothers and I get to the car and I start searching again.  Also My phone is in Lost mode.  Again no luck.  I start thinking it's just glitched out and it's probably gone.  But then I decide to call it.  Now keep in mind, I have the ringtone Pressure by Youngblood Hawke. (link - 
So my first time calling, I hear it!  I HEAR MY AMAZING RINGTONE!  Now I can figure out where...  So I start going up to cars windows and listening and I figure out which one it is.  It is a 2004 Black Ford Explorer with a expired registration parked 2 FUCKING SPOTS NEXT TO MY CAR!  2 SPOTS!  So the door is locked and I now can confirm its in there. 
 I decide to call the cops because someone stole a possession worth a couple of hundred dollars from me.  They get there and I show them that when I call my phone it comes from there car.  They go into Dave & Busters and over the loud speaker they say that someone with this license plate number left their headlights on.  So about 10 minutes later a mom comes out and checks her headlights and me and my family are in the car waiting.  They confront her and say that my phone is in her car.  They told me to call it.  Then I head the ever so soothing of Youngblood Hawke ringing through the parking lot.  They give me my phone back and she says that she had 3 kids, 14, 12 and 7.  She said that she noticed one of them ran back to the car over and hour ago for some reason.

"Field report. 
 I was at a Coachella after party, there was a good looking Latina sitting by herself, she looked in my eyes, I held gaze confidently, she broke eye contact quickly. I then immediately walked up to you and asked  her name. It's Spanish, the accent makes it hard to make out the first two times, but I get it quickly. 
 After extremely brief talking, I take her hand and walk to the dance floor. Not forceful, but with purpose. She follows, good dancing, taking her hands and putting them around me she effortlessly continues the motion as if it were her own. She spins from time to time, giving me her front then her back. I give her a look. 
 Go in for a medium speed kiss, light hesitation, so I stop her and just kissed the corner of her mouth. My friend then comes in saying its time to go. So I get her details, texted myself from her phone, completing the circuit. All while still dancing with her. 
 Set up date for karaoke tomorrow. Turns out that's what's she's into. No problem, I have a number of songs I can sing in any karaoke situation. Best part is, I know she's down, it's just a matter of playing my role correctly. Like acting in a play, only certain actions will render specific results. If I keep her interested by whatever means, the end goal is to make it known you want to fuck. Hints are ok, actually forcing it is not. I still focus on only having a good time no matter what, but make sure when necessary to declare my intents. You can be as cool you want to be, don't make things personal.

"Some background: 
 
 28/m/American 
 27/f/Asian-American (strong Asian background) 
 Dating for 2.5 years 
 Don't live together, but visit often 
 
 I'm looking for advice on if I'm ready to get married. We've been dating for a while and she's a great person. I'll try to lay out the pros and cons of my thoughts, and hopefully you can make some sense. I'm concerned if my thoughts are  should I get married to this person  or  should I get married . 
 She wants to get married soon because of her background and tradition. As unfortunate as it seems to me (because its restricting our options and forcing the decision), I don't think we can continue the relationship unmarried. 
 Pros 
 
 We don't fight too often. When we do, they are hard but end quickly.  
 I can't  think  of any reason not to get married. I tend to overlook flaws, which can be a double-edged sword. Something that bothers me is I said think, not feel. 
 Our plans line up in terms of interest - travel, where to take a honeymoon if we got married, some of our interests (but not all) 
 As much as my ""think"" statements above hold true, I'd feel terrible for leaving the relationship because of how well we treat each other. When we have intense fights that could lead to a breakup (not often, but happens), I can't bring myself to leave. Not sure if I just don't have guts to, which is a personal flaw vs not wanting to leave because of the relationship. 
 
 Cons 
 
 I'm used to having all the time possible to pursue my interests. Getting married feels like a loss on some of that time.  
 We both agree how we act and live now is what we see married life like. We differ here: one of us says ""why marry"" the other says ""why not marry""

 Even before we started dating, he always invited me to any event with ""the guys"". I've been friends with all of his friends for a while and I like hanging out with everyone.

"I also had a similar incident when I was 3 years sober so I can provide you with my experience. 
 There was a girl who came in that i was attracted to and knew it was a dangerous thing to get involved with someone newly sober. She got one of my friends to be her sponsor, and began hanging out in the same 'meeting after the meeting' crew as me. I tried to make sure that I was never alone with her, and strictly hung out with her in a group setting. I also felt the need to conceal these feelings from my fellows because of the 13th step stigma, but i think that was the worst thing i could have done. I felt guilty just for thinking and feeling these things, but the excitement of the idea was still appealing. So i kept my mouth shut and we hooked up the first time we were alone together. After that, the guilt multiplied and i felt horrible. It was the first time in a long time that i became uncomfortable with who i was. Meetings were unbearable. I felt distant and insecure. I got 'looks' that i interpreted as 'shame on you, you're disgusting'. 
 After a few days, i finally decided to tell my sponsor. He was compassionate and caring as usual. He suggested that I quit beating myself up and focus on the solution. So we did. If I wasn't comfortable with the situation, then something needed to change. Her and I decided to break until she finished her 9th step. In that time, we were able to become friends. 
 In the beginning, i would also get jealous when she rode around with other guys, or sat next to someone at dinner, which all revolved around my insecurities. She was not my property and could make her own decisions, even if they were decisions i didn't like. These are all very important things to consider before getting into a relationship with someone. If i am unable to handle situations like this, then i am not in a good place to begin a relationship. 
 I watched as she worked the steps with her sponsor, and her life began to get better. I continued to be a part of aa and service, and my insecurities lessened. I was comfortable with who i was again. 
 I think it's important to note that we did not do this perfectly. We had some 'slips' and they were always when i decided to leave my sponsor out of the decision making process, and those are the decisions i regret. I do not regret letting her focus on herself and figure out who she wants to be, no matter who she is with. 
 Through this process, we both reached a point where our sponsors and friends were both supportive of our decision to try and be a couple. This is a decision i do not regret. We learned to be friends before being a couple, and it has been far better than any relationship I've had in the past. We communicate as friends and don't bicker like lovers. When we harm, we make it right. There are no hidden intentions or agendas. Suspicion is not a part of our lives together. 
 Other girls i have crushed on and gotten to know first before pursuing a relationship, and all of those i do not have regrets about, and it eventually became apparent that it was just lust and nothing to do with their personality or anything that i would want long term. 
 So, if any of that sounds like something you want, then try that.","let her work the steps. Be friends first, then take the next step if it is still something you both desire.",20,M,alcoholicsanonymous

"My freshman year of college, I was invited to an end of the year toga party, at a house called Kingwood, where all the theater and music majors gathered to get smashed. 
 I had never been to a toga party before, and I didn't know that the togas were supposed to be baggy, so I used one of my roommate Natalia's hot pink bedsheets, and she and my best friend Sam spent about half an hour pinning and wrapping it into a slutty little minidress. I had just gotten a spray tan that day (I swear it wasn't orangey or ""Jersey Shore""), my hair looked hot as hell, put on two bras and my tits looked fantastic. I put on my cute black 4 inch heels and a black belt, and I looked hot as hell, not gonna lie. Sam did something similar, and she looked amazing. 
 I show up, and the whole party pretty much cheers and gasps, because I'm the only one there in a non-white sheet, looking sexy as hell, and most of the girls were jealous, because they hadn't thought of looking sexy at a toga party. 
 I soon became the Slut of the Night. I got totally wasted, hit the bowl and the bong a couple of times, and went out back to smoke a cigarette. At this point, I'm feeling pretty loose and spacey. I attracted the attention of five guys, one of which I had a huge crush on, and four of which were fellow theater majors who I had most of my classes with and which I was pretty good friends. 
 They were almost as drunk as I was, and I let all of them motorboat me, grab my tits, and smack my ass. I must have flashed about twenty people that night, and I'm sure I made out with and slutted it up with more than five guys, but I can't remember at this point. 
 I don't care what anyone says, I was loving it. I'm a pretty sexual person, so it really didn't phase me. I also met this guy who was really interesting and sweet, and we made out  all  night. I must have looked so skanky and desperate, but I really didn't give a damn. 
 I'm  never  the type of person to be a slutty attention whore, but it was the end of the year, I was transferring next year, and I thought  fuck it , I'm gonna go hard. It was probably one of the few times in my life where I was  loving  being single. One of the only disadvantages of having a boyfriend is that I would feel pretty awful doing that nowadays.","I let an entire party take complete advantage of me at a toga party, where I was wasted and looked like a total bimbo, and it was the sluttiest and most fantastic party I've ever been to, and probably one of the few times I've felt 100% confident and sexy.",20,F,AskReddit
"I don't know about you, But I'd rather have money than owe it.  I just got out of college, spent a bit more than was probably neccessary, and can't get a job at the moment. (Bachelor's in Accounting). 
 We're working very hard to completely get rid of our debt. Why not buy a house in cash? Judging from our frugal lifestyle, the amount we're throwing at our debt right now could be saved and we could have a decent house ($50k-90k) within a few years.

"Throwaway account for reasons. 
 My girlfriend [26F] and I [28M] have been together for nearly 2 years now.  She moved in to my house with me about six months ago.  Things are great 90% of the time and we avoid a lot of the issues that tend to plague long term couples.  We spend the majority of our free time together and really enjoy each other's company.  But that 10% can completely derail things and it's becoming routine. 
 There's one huge issue that keeps popping up on a nearly monthly basis: she'll find something about my behavior that she doesn't like then focus on it like a laser beam and use it as an excuse to have a huge argument, which results in multi-day animosity between the two of us.  It's totally out of the blue every time.  I never even remotely see it coming.  When we first started dating she had legitimate points.  I'm a young guy and haven't ever been much of a relationship person so I basically just did whatever I felt like doing at the time (just FYI, this did NOT involve flirting with other women or side flings).  I vehemently stuck to the ""be my own man"" mentality for quite a while.  This faded as our relationship went on and we became what felt like true partners instead of just two people dating. 
 The monthly freakouts, however, did not let up.  They became less about actual issues in our relationship and more about totally arbitrary things that haven't even occurred.  She just suddenly picks out something that I did or said and uses it as a launching point to talk about how terrible our relationship is and what an obnoxious, embarrassing person I am.  It's my fault every single time, even if nothing actually occurred.  It's as if her criteria for me being a 'good boyfriend' suddenly changes in her mind for a few days. 
 She's admitted to over-thinking things on more than one occasion but it's really getting to be a problem.  A few examples: One time we watched a movie and she REALLY stretched to find parallels between the movie's toxic relationship and ours, which turned into her breaking down about the myriad of ways that our relationship could go badly in the future.  Whenever I have a rough day at work and need to vent a little, she assumes that I'm exaggerating and my work problems are totally my fault.  I have a family history of depression and handle it with medication, but when a bad episode kicked in and I became withdrawn she just told me I need to get better control of my emotions.  I had a few beers with her parents (they offered) when we visited over Christmas and she completely flipped out when we got home because she thought I was trying to mentally escape with alcohol and how disgusted she was with my behavior.  We nearly broke up over it.  I wasn't drunk at any point and genuinely had no idea what she was talking about. 
 She's been stressed out at work recently.  When she got home, we cooked dinner together, took our dogs for a walk, then traded massages.  By most accounts a solid evening.  Then she told me this: ""I make it too easy for you.  I always have since we started dating.  You should really have to work harder for it.""  'It' referring to sex.  It absolutely infuriated me that she suddenly decided that sex is some sort of currency I need to earn instead of two people who love each other enjoying their bodies and strengthening their bond.  Naturally, we did not have sex.  The thing that made this statement so unexpected to me is that she has a higher sex drive than I do so it's not like I'm constantly 'hounding her for poontang.' 
 I truly do love her and fully intended on proposing later this year.  We spend quite a bit of time talking about our future plans, kids, etc. and are on the same page for just about everything.  We're very open with each other.  I'm an admittedly sensitive person and some of the stuff she says bothers me more than it should.  There's two sides to every story and I feel like I'm making her sound like a lunatic, and these random freakouts are only a tiny part of our time together.  But they are genuinely so soul-crushingly frustrating that I'm questioning even continuing things with her.  I no longer feel like I can enjoy the good times we have together because in the back of my mind I just KNOW she's going to flip out on me with no warning in the next month and there's nothing I can do about it. 
 The arguments always end in the same way: I console her, tell her I'm trying my best, assure her that all relationships have rough spots, we say we love each other and want to stay together, then things gradually go back to normal over the next couple days.  Frankly I'm getting sick of feeling like I'm the only person that needs to change to keep the relationship together.  The next time it happens and she says she has doubts about our relationship over some arbitrary problem that hasn't even occurred, I might end up agreeing with her.  I thought they were growing pains from a maturing relationship but I don't see them stopping any time in the future. 
 Does anyone else have experience in a relationship like this?  I have genuinely never seen her treat anyone else like she treats me in the outbursts.  No matter who she has issues with, she tries to look at it objectively and always shoulders some of the blame.  Other people don't see it when she gets super mad at me - they only see her how she is 90% of the time.  I alone get her bad 10% - because of this I have no frame of reference so I can't really say how much I'm actually at fault.  I really do want things between us to work out, but I can't handle this forever.  If it doesn't lighten up in the future then I don't see her as someone I can spend the rest of my life with.  I need a partner, not someone that will use any excuse to treat me like a verbal punching bag every time they get stressed out.  A relationship isn't exactly healthy when one person is constantly blaming the other for everything. 
 And before the obligatory ""SHE'S ON HER PERIOD"" response, the explosive arguments do not sync up with that.","Relationship is mostly great, but girlfriend has totally unexpected outbursts about what a shitty person I am every 30-60 days.  I convince her that things will be fine and it goes back to normal after a couple days.  Rinse and repeat.  Getting real tired of the Jekyll and Hyde routine.  I have no frame of reference so any input from similar relationship experience is appreciated.",28,M,relationships

 I just broke up with my boyfriend a week ago, whom I was deeply in love with.  It wasn't a bad breakup by any means, he just said he needs a break because of an immense amount of stress he's going through.

"Good afternoon fellow redditors, 
 WALL OF TEXT INCOMING! 
 I’ve been lurking through both /r/cars and /r/whatcarshouldibuy for several months now, as well as poking through 5 or 6 auto websites to see what is out there and educate myself a bit. However, every time I start narrowing my list down, I find something new to add to it (oh Evoras, how I love and hate you). However, I’m looking for a vehicle, and to be sure I’ve plumbed the depths of knowledge out there, I wanted to see if there is anything I’m missing. 
 About me: I’m a 27 YO male working in Finance. I have a youthful face (shave my beard and I get ID’d going to a rated R movie, true story) so I struggle at work to be taken seriously. I’ve had a bad habit of getting a different car every 2-3 years, which has been fun but is expensive. I’d like to find something that I fall in love with and don’t want to get rid of, OR something I buy knowing I’ll be rid of it in 2 years for one of my two dream cars, a Porsche Boxster/Cayman GTS with European delivery to enjoy it all the more or the newly announced manual F-Type (I've loved the look and sound but wanted manual. God save the Queen!). I don’t want either for now because of the appearance issue of a young man driving a Porsche/Jaguar, which leads to a major point of consideration. 
 I’m very well-off; however, throughout life I’ve learned that when others know it, problems arise. So I usually hide it. My preference for clothing is jeans and a t-shirt and I enjoy making friends of the people around me without having trust issues over money. To be fair, though, I enjoy certain things to be nice. I prefer having a nice computer and a nice car; they’re two things that I spend a lot of time in or on, so I want quality, especially when affording it isn’t a question. Having nice things and not standing out, however, is a challenge. For example, I used to have an ’04 Cobra “Terminator” and loved the thing to death; I only got rid of it when I got married to buy something practical, which of course means I realized 3 months later I didn’t need to do that and have regretted it since. I’m a little older now, and am definitely a comfort whore, so I don’t want another Cobra, but I do want to find something that is as much fun to drive, can give you thrills, or just meander on a boulevard cruise. 
 My driving habits: I currently own a Taurus SHO w/ performance pack, which is quick and comfy but lacks any driver engagement (feels very numb) and can be a pain to park. I drive 16k-20k miles a year, often doing a round trip across the country (2,500 miles each way, roughly 36 hours with traffic). I drive for approximately 7-10 hours a week depending on if we go somewhere for a weekend (moved recently and no friends in the area, so we are doing a lot of exploring at the moment). I have a wife that usually prefers I drive (she loves her Mini btw) so I usually have the one passenger, two little Miniature Australian Shepherds who love hanging their heads out the window, and when we have friends around I tend to haul everyone (I’ve always been the driver in my group of friends). I’ve taken driving courses, and was certified previously in racing (very, very minor league which I don’t remember the name of, it’s been 10 years) and I find nothing more relaxing than finding a backroad with no one on it and cutting loose, although nothing crazy (no drifting, 100mph, none of that stuff on streets). I love being in a car. I want it to engage me when driving and coddle me when it’s been a long day in the office. 
 So I search. And now, fellow redditors, I need your help. Help me Redditwan Kenobi, you’re my only hope!","Fun. Comfortable. Quick. Small to medium. 60k or less. Does not stand out/looks inexpensive. Buying in approximately 6 months, give or take a couple. 
 Options 
 Pros.  Cons 
 Golf R – Quick, comfy, good price, manual (yay!).  Manual not available until later next year, looks are meh. 
 Z4 – Comfy, quick, hardtop convertible, manual, would be used.  Not much room, price (comparatively), BMW-owner reputation, looks expensive. 
 Mustang GT – Fun, quick, looks great but doesn’t stand out, good relationship with a Ford dealer.  Large, poor gas mileage (not critical, but can be a tie-breaker), worried about heavy clutch for city driving. 
 2012 TT RS – Fun, quick, 2+2 for insurance, unique without standing out a lot, did I mention quick?  Hard suspension, finding the right one (not driven hard) could be a challenge, wife not fond of styling, the tech looks old for bluetooth/nav. 
 Chevy SS – Manual! Low prices due to demand, V8 yum, decent interior, decent handling, doesn’t stand out.  Large, crazy gas-mileage, large, don’t trust GM much, still large 
 Taurus SHO – What I have, but it’s very large and not very connected. Kind of boring to drive, although it’s very comfortable and still quick. – Not interested in keeping 
 GLA45 – Quick, fun, nice interior, Mercedes quality, hatch practicality.  Expensive, looks expensive, no manual option. 
 M235i – Fun, quick, nice interior, nice size (allows me to bring my little dogs and wife at the same time), reasonable price.  BMW reputation, looks expensive, demand still so high it’s hard to find, had a bad experience last time I went to a BMW dealership. 
 Stingray – The obvious choice eh? Fast, fun, coupe has removable roof, looks to kill, reasonable price for what you get although straining budget.  Looks expensive, don’t trust GM, stands out especially on a younger male. 
 1967 Mustang – Considered buying an old one and getting a new interior put in. Love classic mustangs, looks great without standing out for expensiveness, can be made very comfortable, oh the cruising… I don’t know how to work on cars so would have to find a shop, not sure how expensive an interior would be (nice leather/soft-touch points/stereo/alarm/etc), would not handle well lik everything else on the list, anything added would not add to the value of the car so is money wasted. 
 Miata –  Nope. Thought about getting one with a v8, but I don’t want to buy one when the new one would be coming out within a year. Also, wife doesn’t care for them.

"My boyfriend and I have been together a good minute now, met last August, instantly clicked. He's amazing and I want things to work out between us and they do! We get along amazingly. I adore every thing about him. Our sex life has become an issue for us both. 
 He has an extremely small penis. NOT THE PROBLEM! I don't even care. Normally, sex is important to me but I am so turned on by everything about who he is that, for once, I can honestly say sex isn't even relevant. Good, bad, or ugly, I still want him. However, it has become more than obvious that he has visible insecurities with his size. His insecurities make me uncomfortable, not his penis. The longer we are together, the more he makes it into an impending issue. I DON'T CARE! I just want intimacy with him but he is so insecure about himself that we can't enjoy each other. I was shocked the first time we had sex, I'll admit, but was relieved and comforted by how okay he was. That put me at ease and we had awesome sex several time.... merely, several. Since god damned August. I googled and read about positions for smaller men, sought advice through the internet from women with similar experience... the whole nine. I never wanted what was noticeably an obstacle to become one. I love him and I want him, completely. 
 As time passes, he is less and less affectionate and extremely rarely willing to be intimate with me. I can't even figure out how to initiate any sort of sexual behavior with him, anymore. It's as if we are only friends. I don't want to be friends. I want him to be comfortable and just be with me. I know he desires me; I feel like I am banging my head against the wall here. He has recently started making self-degrading statements about himself when I try to initiate sex or even messing around together. He'll hardly even make out with me. When I feel hurt by that and kind of back off a little, he goes above and beyond to keep me. So what the fuck? I don't want a completely sexless relationship. I can't be happy with that. Penetration isn't a huge deal; there are endless ways two people can find pleasure together. 
 I really care about him and want us to have a nice relationship WITH sexual activity.... I feel like we are just becoming friends and I hate it.

"Hi all, 
 Throwaway here (24 m); I've poked around the FAQs and have done a little searching and have found some genuinely insightful information.  However, my searching skills aren't up to par or my patience ran out too soon; I didn't see any threads that dealt specifically with a dilemma I'm having.  I'm truly sorry if I'm beating another tired topic to death with this post; if I am, could you please point me in the right direction to a thread that could help me out. 
 I've been seeing this girl (22) for 2-3 weeks now.  She is  really  into me and I dig her personality because I can relate to her and be myself around her, a luxury that I really haven't had before.  I don't think right now that the feelings are completely mutual, but given some time I think we might make a good couple. 
 The first time we'd made out I spent a lot of time kissing the nape of her neck when I found out that was a big turn on for her.  She didn't exactly taste very fresh; I chalked it up to a long day including her bicycle ride to work/class, nutted up, and continued with the activity.  It wasn't the most pleasant thing to me, but I enjoyed making her feel good.  I forget the timeline, but either a few days after or before we had a conversation where she'd mentioned in passing that taking a shower wasn't always a necessary thing for her to go out.  I don't consider her dirty, per se, but as someone who won't leave the house without a shower fresh shirt/underwear/socks, it was a slight turn-off. 
 Last night I slept over for the 2nd time; she's been really eager to please me, although she would only give me head while I wore a condom.  I guess I'm a bit old fashioned and don't want to rush things, and we haven't gone to get tested, so I let it slide.  I didn't make a big deal about it and let her go down on me after suiting up.  To be honest, it wasn't pleasurable, she said my penis was too large and didn't fit in her mouth - her teeth were constantly scraping along my shaft and we called it quits in regards to fellatio after a short period.  I've had really good head before - without condoms - but I have no idea where to begin giving advice as I've never sucked a dick.  Consider this topic B, of lesser importance. 
 I truly appreciated her enthusiasm and her eagerness to please me.  We started kissing again and I continued to rub her clit with my fingers and could feel that she was wet.  I offered to go down on her (I did not tell her that I have never done it before) and she obliged pending a quick trip to the bathroom.  After the bathroom break was over we resumed our activities and I made my way down to do the deed.  I spread her legs and went to town.  While I was new to using my mouth, I'm not unfamiliar with the anatomy and she really enjoyed the couple minutes of attention I gave her before she asked me to stop.  She said nobody had ever gone down on her before and it made me really happy to know that I was able to provide her pleasure in such a fashion. 
 The problem was that her odor and taste were revolting.  While I hadn't given oral before, I have tasted other partners' juices while licking my fingers for a bit more lubrication, and they were nothing like what I tasted last night.  Looking back now, I realize that she had just used the bathroom and she probably didn't take a washcloth to the area in question after urinating.  At the time, I did notice a taste of urine (which should have been a warning sign) but I kept going.  At the same time though, I wonder how much of the bad taste might have been due to her just not washing that area as rigourously or regularly as one should in the shower.  While I keep my scrotum and perineum shaved and the groin trimmed, she is completely unshaven; she mentioned to me that she could 'take care of that' but not knowing what to say, I replied that she should do whatever makes her feel more comfortable. 
 So topic A, of greater priority, is how do I confront her about the horrible taste I experienced while going down on her.  In [this thread]( the descriptions provided for a healthy partner match what I have experienced previously: a somewhat-neutral taste that can even be pleasant if you are compatible partners.  Her smell and taste was just putrid, but I feel I'm going to hurt her feelings and make her more self-conscious than she already is about her body if I don't bring it up in the right, sensitive manner.  From what I read, it seems that trimming is the best option to cut down on body-odor, should I recommend this to her. 
 So, /r/sex, thank you for sticking with me in this extremely long post.  Perhaps it was just a fluke due to her recently using the restroom, next time I will do a taste test before committing to going down.  Just not sure what to do.  I feel like I should recommend that we both shower together next time before fooling around, but as she has 4-5 other female roommates, this might not be the best option.  Furthermore, I don't really want to have to hop in the shower just so that I can enjoy our time together.","seeing a girl that possibly doesn't maintain my desired level of hygiene and had an offensive taste when going down on her.

"Some background: 
 We're 16 year old teens.
Been friends for a while, planning on becoming friends with benefits in a week or so.
Allegedly not attracted to each-other romantically, just sexually.
Been having extremely sexually personal conversations the past few days. 
 Alright.  So here's whats going on.  My girlfriend recently broke up with me; I've come to terms with that, though.  About last week I started flirting a little bit with a female friend I've known for a while, nothing much, usually just half-jokes and she'd joke/flirt back. 
 About two days ago we were texting and one thing lead to another and she agrees she'll preform oral sex in a week or two when we go on a little trip with our families.  We keep talking about it, pretty much talk about nothing but what we'll do with each other on the trip for the past two days, and things sounded great.  She agreed she was only sexually attracted to me but not romantically. 
 Today was no different until a bit earlier tonight, when we were having a normal, non sexual conversation and she brings up the fact that my parents don't like her, and that she doesn't like most people at all.  I try making her feel better, saying that my parents don't like anybody (which is true) and that things will get better when she's older.  Then she says she doesn't want to go on the trip anymore.  I ask why, say alright, that she shouldn't go if she doesn't want to, and try to change the subject to something going on in a while where a lot of her friends will be and she says ""I really don't give a fuck about it."" 
 I again say ""alright"" (I don't really have a way with words in these situations), and ask her why she's so down, what happened (my exact words were something like ""What's going on?  I'm confused.  Why are you so down all of a sudden?  Sorry if I said something to offend you).  She says  nothing is going on at all (though clearly something is upsetting her), and I just say ""Okay, good night.  Text you tomorrow."". 
 Anyway, what's up with that?  What should I do?  I don't want to hurt anybodies feelings first and foremost, and I don't want to lose a chance at this sexual relationship (I've never done anything before honestly).","Planning on becoming sexual friends, talking about it for a few days, she suddenly becomes upset during a normal conversation and is saying she doesn't want to go on the trip where we'd become sexual.  I'm hoping I didn't hurt her feelings most of all, but also hoping I didn't just blow this chance. 
 I'm probably just over-reacting, but I don't know.  I've only really been in one romantic relationship and I've never had any experience with anything sexual.  Really don't want to lose this chance.  After all we've talked about the past few days it sounds like the chance of a lifetime.

"Hey guys, I'm a 20 year old guy, second year in college. I have an appointment with my regular doc tomorrow (dentist found a lump under my chin that needs to be checked out) and I'm considering bringing up my suspicions of me having ADHD. 
 I'm a very hard worker.  I live in a state of disorganized organization. And I've never been the stereotypical bouncing off the walls ADHD kid, but I believe that I exhibit quite a few traits that could be attributed to ADHD. 
 -I struggle heavily with staying focused on things i find boring, BUT i still retain most of the information you would think I would've missed.  For example, in HS I had a history teacher who would let me stand by the door looking outside during lecture instead of taking notes because I would still ace the test. 
 -I have a very quick temper. Broken more than my fair share of TVs after getting heated at a video game.  I'm easily annoyed and have a hard time containing the ball of fire that ignites in my chest when something flusters me. 
 -I seem to be drowsy all the time unless i am doing something physically stimulating (running, ultimate frisbee, golf).  Even intellectual subjects I love don't keep my eyelids from feeling heavy. 
 -I have a long history of difficulty suppressing my drive to do stupid things.  I've poured syrup on neighbors' cars, stolen stupid items from classrooms, gotten the school bus turned around halfway home...etc. 
 -As i said before, I am quite unorganized (my bedroom resembles a war zone). Still though, I rarely lose things and almost always know where something is even though it is not where is should be. 
 -And my biggest issue of all is this nearly constant inner monologue that is louder that pretty much any external stimuli.  When my head talk is going strong almost nothing can catch my attention.  Driving to school, the last show I watched, what my boss told me to do...all of these are things that I can rarely recall because my brain was engrossed in thinking about the possibility of a goat uprising and world takeover. 
 Should I ask my doc what he thinks even though I'm going for something completely unrelated?","I feel there is a strong possibility I have ADHD, not positive though.  Is it still worth bringing up my concerns to my doctor in an unrelated visit?",20,M,ADHD
"20ish FPS all timer here, don't know if you'd call me good. 
 There is a point at which your computer's performance will actively prevent you from doing some things. You can duel someone just fine in a controlled environment, but unless you restrict yourself to the smallest fights you can (to preserve FPS), you're going to end up in a big one, your FPS is going to tank, and you simply cannot rely on fantastic aim when your screen starts hitching off the charts. 
 If you end up in a big tech plant or AMP station fight, you need some way to cover for your technical weaknesses. Like flanking stealthily. LA and Inf can do it the best, but people can (and I have) snuck around as HA or Eng. If you aren't going to accomplish anything by running head on (except dying, maybe getting a kill), you flank somewhere unexpected.

But I find that they don't help improve KD, and any advantages they have in close range are mitigated by the fact that they need to get within close range at the first place. So if you can't move in a way that doesn't get you shot, avoid these weapons. They may be unbalanced, but they aren't very good when you look at it, except in certain situations. 
 If you're focused entirely on KD ignore this section: Support. You can't forget to support, unless you main muh grunt class. I know when I play on Emerald, there's a few outfits that absolutely love their spawn beacons. So much so that they will change SL to drop some if their beacons are destroyed. Which is why I like the way Infiltrators support, they are one of the least risky methods of spawn beacon removal in the game. Medics are self explanatory. Engineers, drop ammo, repair things, and use your turret. Especially turrets. If you don't actually sit in it, it's a fairly good wall, and the AI version has a very small hitbox, so you can use it as cover. You can also jump in them, as a stepladder. You know those low walls in biolab entrances? You can set up a turret behind them, jump on and shoot from up there. The walls provide amazing cover, and not many people expect if when they have to deal with all the targets not in cover in front of them.","v, play in a way that makes up for your computer performance. Some people might scream at you for shooting them from the sides or anything other than a head on confrontation. Well, you can't beat them when they have 3 times the framerate you do, and aren't hampered by sudden hitches. You won't be able to consistently land headshots, so they will win if they are any good at all, even if you technically have better aim than they do, any number of performance related fuckery can happen. It's sort of like when pilots complain about flak tanking their frames, they can't do anything if they only see a slideshow.",20,F,Planetside
"When I was around 8 me and my little brother (who was 4 at the time) made up a game. We would put a beanbag on our heads and shape it to look like we had beaks like a bird. The point of the game was to run at each other and knock the other one down which is kinda hard when you cant see each other. Imagine Marco polo, it was sorta like that but with beanbags. All the adults would find this funny when they asked what we where playing because we decided to call the game Mr. Pecker Head.

"A little background story: We were very close friends before we got together. I didn't really like him in that way, but I decided to give us a chance. After a few months, we consummated our relationship. We had a lot of passion during the first few months, and we fell out of the honeymoon phase really quickly. We never really ""dated"" but just hung around and went out with friends. 
 It's been 4 years and we really care about each other, we really love each other, and we really want to get married in the future. But to be honest, I am really bored. 
 We're both 20 years old and I feel as if we're at that age where we're not old enough to have ""adult"" fun, but we're too old to have ""teenage"" fun. And we feel as if we're too young to go on ""sophisticated"" dinner dates. We both don't make a lot of money, (as a matter of fact, he lost his job almost a year ago severely limiting his ability to act as a boyfriend, which put a lot of stress on me because I felt like I had to be both the boyfriend and girlfriend, if that makes sense), so we can't do anything expensive. And since we're tight with money, I'm very frugal with my gas which makes it harder to go out. 
 We hang out almost every day, and all we really do is eat, sleep, and watch TV. It's hard for us to try to find things we like to do together. He's always asking if I want to try some of his hobbies, like TF2 and League, but I'm just not interested; and I have no hobbies that I could ask him to join into. Most importantly, my sex drive has been really low lately so we don't have sex very often. 
 Because of all this, I feel as if we're no longer a couple. It feels to me that we're just friends that have invested a lot of time into each other and have occasional sex. 
 Is there anything that we can do to spice up our relationship again? Any guides to frugal dating? Is there any way I can try to get my sex drive back to where it was in the beginning? (I'm on birth control pills which can be the cause considering it has a possible side effect of ""low sex drive""). Or are there any suggestions to keeping us entertained at home? 
 Here's another thing, which may be an entirely different problem, or it may be related. He was my first and he's been my only. So other than I love him, the fact that we've had sex makes it hard for me to leave him. Sometimes I feel very lucky to have found someone so early in life. But at the same time, is it too soon to settle? A part of me wants to experience actual dating; but the part of me that holds onto the fact he's been my only partner makes it really hard to even consider it. And being bored is making it even more difficult. 
 So I guess my final question is: Reddit, should I salvage our relationship and how? Or should I realize it's time to move on?",My relationship of 4 years is starting to get very boring but I love him. Should I try to fix things or should I move on?,20,F,relationships
"I casually sext a male friend of mine nude pics from time to time. I'm normally very discrete about this. I had gotten a new laptop that was going to be returned today because I didn't like how it synched everything with my microsoft account, so I used the webcam to take some nude pics last night, sent them to my male friend, and went to bed. This morning I was rushing around getting ready then remembered I had to clear the laptop before it was returned. I quickly opened the pictures folder, did crtl + A and hit delete. I forgot to hold down the shift key and they all just went in the recycle bin. My father checked the computer to make sure everything was removed and discovered them. My mom came in my room and had a very tense, awkward conversation with me. 
 The male friend I am doing this with is extremely trustworthy and paranoid to the point where he has a routine of clearing his computer of anything pornographic. I was mortified, but I did my best to maturely state that I'm eighteen and I trust the person to whom the pictures are being sent.

 We stop talking as much, and I just broke up with her this morning.  It was more of a mutual agreement.  She's not ready for a serious relationship, but she doesn't want to lose me.  We tried just being friends, but it didn't work.  The feelings are to strong.  I told her I have to let her go, so she can mature, and figure out who she is.

"I've [20 M] been with this girl [19 F] since the start of that last school year (early September) and it was great all the way up to summer. She told me she loves me around March or April, and has previously told me that she wanted to be sure before she said it. So wonderful. This beautiful girl is in love with me, and I'm in love with her. 
 Now it's the summer, and I still live on campus working and she lives at home working (half hour drive away). So we haven't got to see each other a lot, like 1 or twice a week, which was fine for me. We are both busy, at least I get to see her. 
 So last week she tells me she's unsure about the relationship. That she can't handle being away from me and that's she upset and such that she is just missing me the whole time.
She hasn't said she wants to break up, but I'm not sure what to expect. I keep trying to tell her that it will be back to normal once the school year starts again and we can see each other more but she still seems unsure. Idk what to tell her or what to do. I really don't want to lose her.

"Hey r/sex! 
 I (20/m) just wanted to share a little something I have been testing out for the last couple of days that I am sure you will be interested in! 
 Slight Backstory: So I, like many men, have been disappointed with how long I last in bed, although some times (1 out of every 10 or so) I last longer than my SO (20 f) can handle for whatever reason. Sometimes I can go for days, cum 2 times and still pound her until she screams and goes limp, while others I shoot one off after the first 5 minutes or so and cannot get it stiff enough to go back in. 
 I wanted to make myself last longer, and be more consistent all around (i.e. last 7 times out of 10 longer than my SO), so I have been testing a few different things. 
 One thing that has been extremely successful thus far is what I like to call the Backfire Technique: 
 About an hour or so before your anticipated sexual encounter, begin masturbating and edge (i.e. get close to orgasm) for a little while without actually cumming. I have been edging for about 7-10 minutes for the past few times. It takes practice, and you might go too far. Here is where it gets interesting: 
 Make yourself cum, but without cumming. To do this: slow down while masturbating as you feel yourself about to orgasm. Right before you blow your load, squeeze directly below your head VERY hard, and I mean VERY hard! If done correctly, you should feel your penis pulse like you had an orgasm, but no (or small amounts of clear) fluid should come out. After your pseudo orgasm is complete, release and take a break. Almost no fluid should come out after you release either. 
 When you go at it later, you should last significantly longer. I did this last night and it took my SO about 15 minutes of sucking my cock like she needed it to survive to make me orgasm. Then after I came, we continued to have PIV in multiple positions for over 30 mins until she could not take any more. 
 Tell me what you guys think, and I will answer any questions you have ASAP. If you have the time, try it out for yourself and post your results. I am very curious to hear if this actually works with others!","Edge for about 8 minutes about an hour before your sexual encounter, right as you come squeeze very tightly below the head.

"I am struggling with the idea of sex before marriage in a longer term committed relationship.  I having been having an internal argument for a long time now, with whether it is okay to have sex in a loving relationship, before marriage.  I am in love with my boyfriend, and we have discussed marriage (we are both 24); yet I am struggling with the idea of having sex or not.  I am also having a hard time trying to relate to what the bible says on sex, since it was written in the times when 15 year olds would get married therefore avoiding relationships without sex in their prime years of life (20-30s).  Many of the passages that are on the topic of sex, are vague, and can be translated to multiple meanings. 
 If it is an act of love with two consenting adults, is it still considered a sin?  I am curious as to what others think about this topic.

Do you see it as a sin?
Do you regret it?

"About 1.5 months ago I got in the biggest fight with my ltr of our relationship. I am 30 and she is 28. She ended up going home to her parents house for about 2 weeks to think things over. We finally hit a breaking point but she ended up coming back and we are working through it.  This has led me on a road to better myself with or without her. I was a mess when she left but I'm now finally to see that life without her is possible. I'm not going to kid myself in thinking I don't have oneitis. 
 I did a lot of introspection and reading and have finally started to realized how beta I've become with her over the years. I was addicted to porn for probably about half my life and weed for 10. I have since cut both of those things out. I also  have since read NMMNG and I think I relate to that so much and used the porn and weed as an escape. 
 In he beginning of our relationship was crazy sex marathons. But after a a few years it simmered down to about once a week. At first I thought it was just because I was bored of her. I was/am extremely attracted to her but I didn't need her as much sexually because I had let porn consume my sexuality. I see that now since I've quit the porn. 
 In the initial period of 2-3 weeks of no porn  barely fapped and maybe had sex once with her. Since then I have been initiating with pretty good results..maybe 4-5 times in a week. I have also read SGM earlier with decent results. 
 She does reject me and I try to be OI but it ends up with me being too butt her and she can see straight through it. E.g. Last night, before bed, I initiated a BJ and she declined. I was trying to be direct with her but saw it as too demanding and didn't comply. I ended up just being cold to her not cuddling/hugging/kissing and attempted to go to sleep. She woke up in the middle of the night to me reading and I tried to initiate again with her hard no again...she then got upset, started to cry and said I was being a jerk and all I wanted her for was sex. I comforted her by hugging and kissing her and it actually resulted in her giving me a bj when I attempted to initiate again (I reciprocated afterwards when she asked). 
 While I do enjoy the sex that is not the only reason I'm with her...I do the majority of the cooking/cleaning in the house. I see now that it is pretty beta but I'm simply better/more efficient than her at those things. She helps wherever she can/when I ask her. After reading NMMNG I can see how I am sometimes resenting her for this.  We both have full time jobs. Do I continue doing these things as the captain of the ship for myself? Do I only do my portion of the laundry?? I don't feel like waiting for a time for us to both do it together sometimes and just want to get the job done. 
 I'm learning day by day to maintain my frame better. Remaining calm and removing myself from situation when she starts getting emotional/crying. Previously I would engage her and try to defend myself getting emotional myself and end up resenting her. TRP and MPR has helped me a lot so far in a short time. I've always lifted and have maintained myself in decent shape.","Gf has made me beta/more beta after 6 years together. I was addicted to weed/porn and neglected my needs as well as hers. I used those as an escape from my problems and my resentment from my gf's outbursts. I failed to hold frame and fell into her frame and yelled/argued with her. I have much more success initiating regular sex than trying to get a bj. Gf thinks I'm a jerk for being demanding -- pushing her head / sticking my dick on her face.  I'm going to stop that for the time being...my smv is probably not high enough to her right now? 
 How do I balance between validating her emotions/feelings while maintaining my new boundaries? So far I'm maintaining frame, AA, AM, and leaving situation. Is this all I can mostly do?",30,M,marriedredpill
"Fortunately this wasn't a super drawn-out or serious relationship, but I was young and naive and head over heals for this guy I worked with.  He was 32, I was 18, he was on the rocks for a while with a long-term girlfriend, and we started hooking up right after they broke up and he moved out. 
 It got more serious and went on for about 6 months, while we never put a label on it he told me he wasn't interested in dating anyone else. One day I get a message from a random friend, asking if I was still dating this dude because her friend had a crush on him.  I thought it was weird but responded that I was.  She called me and told me that he'd been with this other girl for the same amount of time as me, and she had become his ""girlfriend"" about 3 months before.  So, technically, he was cheating on her with me. 
 Me and girl 2 (we were Facebook friends and had met a few times) talked on the phone and told each other our histories with dude.  We had very similar stories.  We decided the best way to go about it would be to ambush him.  She parked a few blocks away from my apartment and came in while I invited him over to ""talk.""  We were sitting on the couch when he walked in and I will NEVER forget the look on that fucker's face.  We spent about an hour yelling it him, telling him he was a piece of shit, and he had the fucking nerve to tell girl 2 that I was a huge mistake and he had realized just the day before that he was in love with her.

"So, background. 
 I’m 20 year living overseas on one-year university exchange. I come from a latin country, my english is good but I stutter sometimes. I have been in a LTR since 15 until I moved here, so very little experience with game. 
 On the looks department, I’m skinny, not very tall (178cm 138lbs), thin arms and shoulders, and two things that bother me a lot: a. I can’t grow a fucking beard. Honestly, with all the ‘beards are sexy’ ‘beards equal sex’ hype going on this is a fucking downer. Every guy my age wears one. and b. I’m a serious dude and I hate smiling. I’m insecure about my teeth, I mean, I think I’m actually handsome while keeping a straight face, but look ugly when smiling. Its quite polarising. I’m even considering putting on braces again when returning to my home country. 
 On the game department, I absolutely suck at day/bar/club game. Specially the latter, maybe because I don’t stand out, am not confident enough, look too young, etc. Most of the girls I’ve hooked up with apart from my 4-year LTR were somehow from my social circle, I locked them down, made some sweet talk here and there if I get some IOI, I isolated them and closed. I have tried cold approaching, I get easily past the AA but I get turned down/get IODs every fucking time, maybe I’m being too outcome-dependent, who knows? I can get some good openers and maybe make her laugh, but I can’t escalate past that, even if I get some IOIs. 
 There’s a whole social circle of (female) exchange students that I know just waiting to get fucked, I’ve seen guys with SMV lower than mine hook up with 7 and 8’s, but it’s being really hard for me. Sometimes I think it is simply because I’m not confident enough (I feel myself overwhelmed by competition), or can’t present myself as a sexual being, when I make my intentions clear, I just feel creepy. I tried not giving a fuck, but if you aren’t super attractive women won’t present themselves, you have to actively go after them, but when I do that, I feel I’m being needy or emanating a scarcity feeling. It can’t be that hard, I just want to get fucking laid!! It’s been 7 months, ugh! I can't even write this post properly. 
 Sorry for the rant and the long post, but do you have any suggestions or just reads based on that situation?

"This will probably get buried at this point but whatever.  here you go  but I think I was most influenced in my teen years by bands like Venom, Bathory and Burzum.

"So, I am 26 and have an above-average penis size -- at least from what I have read in various publications. I'm a little over six inches, good girth, never had any problems with my tool. 
 I've been in a relationship for the last eight months, give or take. My girlfriend is great, the love of my life. We get along amazingly and along with that comes the best sex of my life. Really, sex with her just keeps getting better and better -- and we do it a good amount. Some days we will have sex two or three times, but every time we are together (we don't currently share a residence) we usually fornicate at least one time. 
 In the past couple months, my girlfriend keeps saying that my penis is getting bigger. I always say, ""Ha ha, yeah right. I wish,"" but I am not a physiological expert nor am I one to just let things go and not think about it. Her reasoning is that nowadays, I get  really  hard  all  the time. My penis is like a cobblestone, or a jackhammer -- whichever you prefer. It's on another level and I am actually wondering, is my penis growing or is it just functioning at a sexual peak? 
 My girlfriend must have a lot to do with this. I honestly don't masturbate all that much (couple times a week), but I have been having sex since I was 18 and I have  never  been this hard this often. My penis feels like a super penis, at least to me. 
 So, is it crazy to suggest that a penis can grow after 26 years of living?

"She 27, me 30. Been together on and off 5 years. The craziness started, in hindsight, within year 1 or 2 but I never noticed or thought could be deemed crazy because 1) she comes from a family I would just never think could produce such a person 2) i experienced such highs and love with her that I accepted the lows or fights as part of it 3) societal pressure to marry/settle down with this 'perfect girl next door.' (all my friends and family would comment on how great she was and how they hoped we would be together). 
 
 I'll admit, when we had split up, I would like chase. Not because I needed her (maybe I did), but because I felt after 10 years of dating and relationships that ""i had learned something and was level headed enough to handle conflict."" I mean, if you have a fight a few hours or a night to cool of is normal, right? But why drag things out, so I would text, call, plead, or let her back in, even if she ignored me for a whole week. 
 However perusing through [13 signs your wife or Gf is a BPD or Narcissist]( leads me to the following conclusions... 
 That most of those are attributale to her. Those most damning part of this all is, I've become a horrible monster in the process. Weighing on me particularly badly now was the fact I did try to patch things up with her and we were hanging out. 
 
 The other night was a friends b-day and we all went out (about 25+ of us). She was a bit sore because ""i didn't do enough for her"" and she felt upset about how I was out for his, but we hadn't gone out for her's (i saw her on her bday, brought her flowers and a card and was arranging something like a getaway that she didn't know about). Needless to say, as we all are heading in separate vehicles to the next location it is obvious she's unhappy and so i open pandora's box up to see if we can change that. I can't and it got worse... 
 
 She stated how she was upset we were out for his b-day but she felt pissed still about her's. I made a comment about my b-day, at which point she brought my mother into the conversation about how she 'messed up my 30th and that my gf was the ONLY one who cared about me. She tells me how my mother phucked my birthday up and didn't care and blah blah blah. 
 I lost it. I turned the music up to go zen and zone out and she turns it down as she's freaking that she might have lost her phone. I grab her arm as she hits the dial, remove it and hold it while twisting and strangling her arm. I felt horrible, like an abusive asshole and I was. I pulll over to the side of the road and scream I hate her at least 10x. 
 
 I'm horribly wrong for what I did. I told her that. I attempted to talk about things and apologize. I admitted that was a POS move. I accept full responsibility. After this many years, after me trying to involve her with my friends this night and how she had embarrassed me on countless other occasions, I couldn't fathom how she was ruining this night. 
 She only agreed to come at noon time and this was 930pm. We had been having a good time and then she ends up going nuts on me. I've lived in a world of crazy and depression. For the times I have bothered to talk to people, I've exhausted those resources and embarrassed myself. She sees nothing she does as wrong and even when I try to 'talk', she's impossible and inconsolable. She will not see her insults about my mother as part of the problem (not justifying my behavior and 2 wrongs don't make a right), but this is NOT the first time she's attacked me via my family. 
 
 She's always been jealous about my tightness with my family, claiming 'they don't care for me as she does,' and 'how can I put them above her.' Anytime I've had plans with them and they could conflict with her expectations, she's blown her smoke stack. Even though MY friends became HER friends, but HER friends are HER friends. (Her's do not like me because she has told them about our fights, but only my wrong doing). 
 
 She comments about how my parents are not apparently happily married and how my dad can be cold and will comment that I being like him or them in the midset of an arguement or fight. 
 
 She claims I 'take things too personal about my family,' even though I would NEVER speak about an SO's family, unless I truly saw abuse, and even then, they were there BEFORE me, so what right, unless I marry a woman do I have of getting involved? 
 
 
 
 All in all, I don't know if up is down, down is up, or what's going on. Everything that has occurred follows nearly perfect to the link and all those I've researched. I was made to look like a fool countless times over as she took breaks and goofed around with other guys, then hung them over my head like some challenge to beat. 
 Going out on this note sucks. I'm sure the Reddit response will be de-facebook, lawyer up, hit the gym. I get you. But this goes deeper. 5+ years of this stuff eats away. I would be lying if I said I'm not partially depressed after this (or maybe personally). 
 All the times she did open the door to talk, or picked the phone up, there was no joint resolution. Rather, she dropped the cold shoulder act and we'd hang out. I never felt a sense of carthasis, that we understood what we did and it would be solved. Rather, I apologized for what I did or didn't do and that was it. She's given a sorry card here or there, but going after my family? Telling me I need therapy because of my familial relationships? 
 Anyone been there? Can you relate? 
 I'm not saying I want back on this ride...but I've never felt so lost and alone. Adding insult to injury is how beautiful she is, so come tomorrow all the beaus waiting in the wings swoop in like vultures. I get that she's stuck around through these times and sort of come back and I commend her, but it also sucks that everytime she's 'run away', she's gone off and dated and I haven't.

"Hopefully this doesn't get too long since I usually ramble on lol* 
 I'm 33, born male. Had anxiety/depression/body image issues since puberty.
Finally realized this past few months I'm trans and everything suddenly makes sense and my panic attacks stopped and I'm feeling more social and happy even when presenting male. Also quit drinking finally. 
 Wanted to see a therapist for years for those issues and alcoholism but the anxiety preventing me. 
 Now however I had my first therapy session yesterday and have another on Monday with the same therapist and have another therapist scheduled next Saturday to see which I like better. This is too important for me to let my anxiety prevent me from transitioning! 
 Ok that's a quick background. Now all this has made me also think about my sexuality, although technically I've always been thinking about this but now that hopefully I can start exploring my sexually now that I feel comfortable with myself and my body (or will once I'm transitioning). 
 By definition I know I'm bi since sexually I'm attracted to men and woman. I want to have sex with women (haven't yet), but also want to give oral to a guy and receive anal (I do enjoy using toys).
Also unrelated to that I now I realize why I also usually identify with the female in porn I watch lol 
 Anyway sexually I like everything. However physically and emotionally I'm only attracted to women (cis/trans). 
 My porn preferences were usually lesbian or transgender porn. I sometimes did watch gay porn but they had to be really feminine and twinkish and it had to be really sexual.
If they talked a lot or it was more about making out it did nothing for me so I usually just stuck with lesbian/trans porn. I'm speaking in past tense since lately I haven't watched any and haven't been horny (not on hormones yet but just lost interest). 
 Now my sexual history:
Like I said, never had sex with a woman.
Did however experiment with a male friend during my teens. 
 We met when I was 8 and he was 7 when we became neighbors and we became best friends. 
 A couple years later probably around age 10 or 11 we'd occasionally show each other our genitals when playing in the woods and sometimes touch them together. Nothing out of the ordinary for kids and I also remember doing similar things with other friends when I was real young (~5). 
 When puberty hit and we both started masturbating I started getting porn on my PC.
I had my own PC in my room and he had a shared family PC so he couldn't get any so he'd come over and I'd show him some. 
 He'd then go use my bathroom to masturbate. 
 Shortly after one of us (probably me I'm guessing lol) suggested I help and give him oral while he watched, so I did.
He'd say when he was ready to cum and I'd stop and he'd finish in a tissue. After that I then asked in return for what I did could I get on top? 
 So I'd do that and then pull out when ready and finish in a tissue. 
 At the time my family was religious as was I (in so much as I believed not that I actually really did religious things) and I thought being gay was wrong and I'd get HIV just from doing this.
So I always felt super ashamed after, especially because I didn't feel gay since I wasn't attracted to him at all it was just sexual so I couldn't figure out why I couldn't stop. 
 This continued for my entire teenage years until I turned 18. I stopped at 18 for two reasons. One he would've still been 17 so I was worried about age of consent stuff.
And 2 was my shame issues. I convinced myself it was just dumb teen experimentation but if it continued as an adult it meant I was gay and that would be the worst thing ever I thought at the time :/ 
 Now I'm atheist and open so I no longer regret what I did. In fact I do have regrets but only that it didn't go further. I never helped him to completion now I wish I had and he never tried to penetrate me and I wish I had let him try. Also I wish I had penetrated him but since I was overweight and below average I never actually penetrated when I'd go on top. 
 That was my last and only experience with sex. 
 So I'm not sure if me wanting to give oral and receive anal now is maybe just a nostalgia thing lol? 
 Also any chance, even though what I did doesn't bother me anymore that somehow deep inside the religion/shame issues are clouding me so all I see is the sexual attraction but maybe I could eventually be physically/emotionally attracted to men as well as women? 
 I'm wondering this because part of me wishes I was so my choices would expand greatly and now with the transitioning thing I'm sure I'll get more attention from men since even as male I'd get hit on by guys a lot but have to tell them I'm straight. Now I'd have to tell them I'm a lesbian but if I could tell them I'm bi and mean it it would open up a lot of things for me. 
 I suppose things may become clearer when I get on HRT since I've read others who have similar feelings (attracted only to females or attracted to females but still sexually like it all) and once on HRT realized they liked both or even started preferring men. I realize my hormones won't change my sexual preference but it may help me realize what was already there but I was suppressing. 
 Also I realize I have a fear of men which makes sense now but I always felt different than them and intimidated by them which now I realize is because I was trying (and failing miserably at lol) being one of them when I wasn't. Maybe once this fear goes away it'll allow me to be attracted to them completely. 
 *Ok sorry see I rambled! lol",Attracted to woman (sexually/emotionally/physically) but also sexually I like males. My only sexual experience was with a male but it was purely sexual and unsure if that experience is why I fantasize about it now but if I did it again maybe I wouldn't like it. Also could I be suppressing the physical/emotional attraction to men due to my religious upbringing and/or uncomfortably around them since I never felt like one myself anyway.,33,M,AskLGBT
"I am 14 and he is 12. We are always arguing and it usually gets pretty intense. He always raises his voice, screaming at me. He even pulled a knife on me once. I always try to stay calm, keeping a low, quiet voice.

I admit, about halfway through the fight, I usually hurt him. He calls it physical abuse and threatens to call the cops, but really I never do any thing that would even come close to physically or emotionally scarring him. It makes me so frustrated and sad that he won't think about this logically. He's always pulling the God/Bible card and asking me if I enjoy hurting him. Naturally, he's exaggerating the situation.

"I'm 32.5 weeks and never gave up coffee.  I cut back to one weak shot of espresso in my cappuccino per day during the first trimester (though I spent weeks 9 and 10 in Italy and had one to two of their cappuccinos per day there, because how could I not?), and then after the first trimester bumped it up to one stronger shot, and now that I'm in the third I very occasionally even will have two in my drinks. 
 My OB said that as long I keep it to under 200/300 mg of caffeine per day, it's fine (one starbucks shot of espresso has about 75 mg, not sure what regular coffee has but 1 cup is def way under 200/300 mg unless you're having a venti starbucks coffee). 
 Have you read the book Expecting Better?  The author makes a really good point about how there is a CORRELATION between excessive caffeine in the first trimester and miscarriage, but they haven't shown that caffeine CAUSES miscarriages.

"Most awesome place was this, not really because of the location, more the situation:

Time. Like you I felt I was supposed to like girls and as hard as I tried I just couldn't work out what my friends were on about.

I planned to start by going to a brothel to get it over and done with but it just never seemed right.

"I've been seeing this guy (he's 24, I'm 22) for about a month and a half and things have been going really well. He's said that he's never felt like this about anyone so early on, and that he's never had such a laugh with a girl before. We can talk for hours and not get bored and we've been able to be really open about loads of things. 
 Usually I hear from him every day. I saw him last weekend; he dropped me off before going to see his mum, but then I didn't hear from him. I dropped him a quick message to ask how his day went the next day, and nothing. He'd read the message though which is completely unusual. 
 Eventually I sent him another one basically saying that if things had changed for him, I felt that I deserved a bit more than just being ignored; at least an explanation or something. He responded that night apologising for blanking me and saying he was an asshole, but some shit has hit the fan in his life and he's not really known how to deal with it. 
 I said that I understood, but also mentioned that I'd been a bit upset after being left to wonder what was going on. He said (again after a long wait) that he was so sorry and that he knew it was upsetting, but he just needs a few days to pull himself together. 
 I'm really confused. I know on the surface it seems simple enough, but I can't help wondering what's going on and if I'm actually going to hear from him at all. He hasn't said whether it's family stuff or anything (although I did stop hearing from him after his mum had asked to see him). 
 Men, as a socially confident and outgoing guy having been with a girl you really clicked with for a short while, would you say this if you had just randomly decided that you didn't want to see the girl any more?

"When I was 5 I had a beautiful black kitten named Labyrinth, after my favorite movie at the time. He was awesome from what I recall, but he didn't last long. Maybe a few months. I came home one day and my parents tell me he got under the reclining chair, and they didn't realize it. Someone closed the chair, and his head got caught in the mechanism.

"Hello /r/relationships, 
 I've had a relationship with my girlfriend for the past 2 1/2 years, and live with her in the same suite. 
 Up until recently everything went great, until about New Year's Day 2014. Ever since then, I've had constant thoughts about breaking things off with her despite things not seeming wrong at all. We almost never fight, any issues are worked out almost instantly, neither of us hold grudges, and everyone seems to think we are perfect for each other. 
 The thing is, I do not think I am in love with her anymore. I still love her, just not romantically. We rarely get intimate anymore and when we do, it's always me to initiates it. I really see her as more of a friend to hang out with rather than a romantic partner. 
 So, now I'm in a dilemma. Because you see, we live together and our nearest homes, should we break up, is about 3 hours away for me, and a whole continent away for her. 
 And there's also the fact that my parents absolutely love her, and they've even hinted at me multiple times that I should marry her, and that I should never let her go. Her parents also approve of me. 
 But since I have these thoughts about breaking up so often and almost all the time I just don't know what to do. I do not think I can marry her like this, unless these thoughts just go away at some point (which I doubt) 
 I'm also worried for the inevitable that should we break up, our friendship would crumble too. 
 I know this kind of sounds rushed, it's just that I do not know how to express my feeling properly at the moment. I can provide more details if you need more. 
 The way I see it there's three options: 1) Stay with her, hope these thoughts go away eventually. 2) Break up with her and move out. This is tricky considering the placement of our other homes. 3) Break up with her, but stay living in the same suite (we have an additional bed/bedroom). 
 Would anyone have any advice for me? I am really stuck in a bind and I have no idea how I can fix this.",I (the boyfriend) is having constant thoughts about breaking up with an amazing girl despite having no real troubles with each other. Wondering what I can do.,20,M,relationships

"My brother Tom, has been in a relationship with Julie for a few years. They moved in together at the beginning year, and shortly after Tom was arrested.  He ended up breaking probation and spending 30 days in jail this past summer.  After serving the 30 days, Tom was put on probation for 6 months after which his record would be expunged. Tom is a recent college graduate and until the arrest was planning on going to graduate school. 
 I recently found out from my father that Julie in insanely controlling and emotional/physically abusive.  I met her at my brother’s graduation, but don’t know her very well at all. On several occasions, Tom called dad crying after Julie had hit him telling him how stupid he is.  Tom says he wants to break up with her but also says he’s so in love with her that he can’t.  Tom had planned on applying to graduate schools once his record was clean and getting any old job in the meantime but claims it’s difficult to find a job because he’s constantly chauffeuring her around and she doesn’t let him go places alone.  She keeps him from his friends and always goes through his phone, but won’t let him go through hers.  Anytime they fight, Julie threatens to go sleep with other guys. 
 My father helped support Tom the past couple months while he was looking for jobs and trying to get his stuff together, but dad started to feel like Tom was manipulating him and wasn’t actually trying very hard, so he’s been cut off financially for a few weeks now.  Julie is a year behind Tom in school, but also has plans to go to graduate school.  After they moved in together, Julie quit her job, so neither one of them is really bringing in any income at this point.  Tom recently explained that he hasn’t been applying to graduate schools because he wants to wait another year to see where Julie is going to go. 
 Dad has told him time and time again that he could always move back home to get on his feet, but he won’t leave Julie.  Dad found Tom a job opportunity that paid amazingly well and was only part time, but Tom didn’t take it because it would have required him to be a 3 hour car ride away from Julie for two months. 
 Despite his recent poor decisions, my brother is a smart, capable guy.  Maybe his self-esteem is crushed and he’s afraid of being alone? Maybe he thinks no one will want to be with him since he’s been in jail and that he deserves someone like Julie?  Maybe he’s just lazy?  He talks about wanting to talk to a therapist, but won’t commit to actually doing it. 
 Julie and Tom are going to my dad’s house for Christmas day, and dad told me he plans to have a “come to Jesus” talk with both of them.  I advised against this, because I figured it would just push them closer together.  I should also mention that my dad and Tom have always had a great relationship, and despite being financially cut off, they still talk regularly.

"It's been a long-ish time since my last relationship, which was one that was the first-love type firey-sparky romance that ended in an unhealthy realization that the two of us were way too serious and only 22, and that we were way too young to get married. 
 Since that breakup, I have to admit that I've been a little scared that I'll never really fall in love again in that perfect ""this feels right"" way.  In particular, I have something that frequently happens.  Recently I've been seeing a girl that expressed a lot of interest in me.  She's kind and funny and pretty fun to hang out with, it's not super serious yet but I enjoy dating her (and the shitty thing to admit, it had been a year since I had had sex and really wanted to break that dry spell). 
 But for some reason I don't feel an intense burning ""I'm in love fire"" with her.  Maybe it's that she's not really totally my physical type, which is obviously shallow and really shitty to admit.  Maybe it's that there's something about her personality, she's a great and mature and fun person, which makes me fear that maybe I'm only attracted to unhealthy obsessive women who are prone to being overly mellowdramatic and ""you're my world"" into me. 
 Anyway, I'm at kind of a crossroads here, I've been seeing her for a little over a month now twice a week or so, and I'm not sure if I should break it off, or give it more time.  On one hand I like being with her and I really enjoy dating her, but I also don't feel like I could genuinely tell her ""I love you"" right now, and I'm not sure if that will change.  I'm also worried that I might be wasting her time. 
 A major fault of mine is that I haven't been in a lot of relationships that weren't super serious super quick.

"Hi reddit, 
 My LDR (300 miles) bf (m/21) and I (m/21) have an almost perfect relationship (1 yr, 9 mos) in so many ways. Our personalities mesh extremely well, we share the same values, our families like each other, we're committed to each other for life (I am to him and he tells me he is to me). The other week I surprised him for 9 days and it went beautifully well. He took me in with open arms and it was clear that he has always been loyal and faithful to me. He showed me off to his friends and spoiled me rotten with both affection and good food. We have a lot of chemistry and the sex is normally very good (with some bad days because I was jetlagged coming straight from Asia when I saw him). I could only speak for myself when I say that I'm very attracted to him and it seems that it's mutual. 
 The problem is that he sucks at communication. I mean, he's not AWFUL at it, but on a scale from 1-10 I'd give him a five. He goes through periods where he is excellent, and then drops off the face of the earth for a few days at a time, out of absolutely nowhere, and he's completely unreachable. Like, it's honestly impossible to tell when he's going to disappear, he just does, and it usually doesn't correlate with mood or anything, it's just completely random. I really don't get his psychology. Like, he appears to care about me but then vanishes. 
 I learned about the mancave argument, but men who are entering caves often show some kind of hint, like, ""I'm feeling really shitty, i need to get things sorted out."" But his vanishing is not always to go into a cave, especially since when he's having a hard time he usually vents to me about it instead of going into a cave (he more often than not takes the traditionally female route with problems). When he emerges, I like to pretend nothing happened as he usually does, even though I feel like interrogating him in order to understand why he'd disappear like that. Note that I notice a positive correlation between him disappearing from facebook and disappearing from me. (When he goes NC with me he never does anything on fb). But since he talks to me so much more than his LD friends and family, you can't even compare, but his parents say he doesn't talk to them either during these moods, except during their prescribed Sunday night chats, during which he usually keeps the chats quick and still ignores me if he's in a ""cold phase"" (though sometimes that's when he breaks the silence since he's on skype anyway.) He always gets mad at me when I question his loyalty or ask him where he's been, because it upsets him that I ""don't trust him"" (It's not that, I really do trust him, I just want to understand why he disappears because it toys with my emotions). He tells me I overthink things. 
 It's never been because of something I did wrong. Normally when I do something wrong he's very good at lambasting me about it (I like that about our relationship - he tells me what he feels so that resentment doesn't get a chance to build). 
 My friends say (and my intuition too) that he disappears because he's simply not a thoughtful person about people who aren't around in person. He doesn't think about talking to me, he just thinks ""oh, I can hang out and watch TV in the common room with my friends, [insert name of show] is on!"" He doesn't think about me when I'm not around, doesn't consider me in his small decisions (but usually weighs my opinion heavily in his big/important decisions) he doesn't care about how I'm doing on a day-to-day basis - he assumes I'm a strong woman and can hold my own, doesn't want to indulge in missing me in fear of ruining his grades... I've heard a whole range of explanations. I just want answers and asking him just gets him so frustrated with me, telling me that I overthink things and am being ridiculous. 
 It's not a ""busy with work"" thing. He has loads more free time than me. My bf is super quick and efficient with getting work done. While I was with him he got a 15-page report and powerpoint presentation done in around 10 hours total (over the course of 3 days) and he's done with class so he has all day free, and has zero extra-curriculars or jobs, so work is not a valid excuse. I know he has projects due but it's doubtful he'd ditch me for them, esp since he almost always procrastinates by talking to me while he's working. 
 I left his place on Tuesday morning and the last time I heard from him was Tuesday night when I told him I got in okay and he seemed distracted. Normally after we visit each other he usually sends me a sweet romantic text, email, or fb message about how much fun we had and thanking me for coming or having him at my place, but this time there was nada, just one text asking me if I had enough money to get from the train station to the airport. It's surprising because I organized a nice surprise, brought him lots of gifts from where I was in Asia, we had a great time, and I was able to lift him out of a slump. Based on our visit though, I wouldn't say the spark is gone at all. It's alive and well. 
 Our relationship is otherwise perfect. He just sucks at communicating. I spoke to some of his female friends (all are very genuine, honest people, and either gay or in committed relationships, don't worry) and they all totally sympathize with me and don't understand his behaviour either. They said if they were me they'd do the same thing (try to chase him) or worse (hit him upside the head, one girl joked), one of them even suggested I post it on reddit, so here I am.","Wonderful bf of 1.75 years is fabulous except he has random spans of time (usually a few days) where he disappears off the face of the planet for no reason.

I wish I could say I'm stronger but it's hard on me emotionally, because he's not a rock - I can't count on him to be there for me. How do I get him to stop taking me for granted?

 NOTE: Advice to DTMFA will not be taken. 
 NOTE 2: During warm phases I'd say we talk about once every 12-24 hours, and during cold phases he could go up to a week if I didn't intervene (i.e. by calling his mobile phone and by some stroke of luck manage to catch him and saying things like ""hey stranger"" - but he hates when I call his phone so I stopped).

"I just recently graduated from college with my BA in English and I am finding it impossible to find a job. I do have a bit of work experience however it is more in the service industry (customer service) which is not very helpful for jobs I am applying to (anything business related). I barely made it through college and my GPA is a whopping 2.8 overall and due to being so committed to my failing sorority (as president), I was unable to get any internships/keep a job. 
 Now I am living with my boyfriend and his roommates keep making me feel horrible for not being able to find a job. I have been working hard but the only places have heard back from are companies that appear to be scams (when I attempted to do research on them). I have no source of income and have five months until I have to begin making payments on my student loans. 
 To make matters more complicated, my boyfriend is in the navy and we will have to move to South Carolina in September, making it extremely difficult to get into a career here in Washington. I had originally wanted to go to a foreign country and teach English abroad but now that I am in a serious relationship (not to mention owning two cats), I don't feel like I could leave them behind to pursue this. 
 An option I could take is to go back to my hometown and have my mother set me up in a dead-end job, but I would be extremely unhappy and would never get out of there. I really feel so worthless and that I am just becoming a burden to my boyfriend and driving him and the roommates crazy. Especially since I have nothing to do so I rarely leave the house.

I wasn’t expecting him home until the next morning because he had a late start and his mother has a habit of talking him into staying the night. I am a light sleeper, and I awoke to what sounded like a boat engine. Not really that unusual, there’s a lot of boat activity where I am, and my bedroom faces that part of the water, so I can usually hear everything that goes on out there. I checked my phone and it was roughly 1:30. At that point, I did think someone was just a weird asshole out there at that time of night, but I eventually stopped caring and fell back asleep. I remember waking up to the sound of footsteps on our ground floor. There are hardwood floors, so I can hear the entire route someone travels from one side of the house to the other. I assumed my boyfriend had decided to come home after all, and I listened to him move around the house, waiting for him to come upstairs. I had almost drifted back to sleep when I heard footsteps on the stairs. My room is the first room, directly at the top of the stairs, and I leave the hallway light on, most nights. I heard him open our bedroom door, and I didn’t turn over right away. Our bed faces the door, and I was turned on my right side, facing away. I didn’t even open my eyes for a while, I was groggy and I had no idea what he was doing. Finally I realized he still hadn’t come in, because I could see the light through my eyelids and I finally rolled over to ask him what the hell he was doing. There was a man in my doorway, a man that I immediately realized was not my boyfriend. I noticed his hair immediately. He had really long, scraggly hair, and he was much shorter than my boyfriend. I couldn’t see many details of his face at that point, mostly the silhouette from the hallway light. I panicked. I immediately thought I was going to die and I had to get out of there. I screamed, started crying, the whole deal. I have a remote lightswitch, which I am not sure hurt or helped me really, because I then had to see this disgusting man. He looked dirty, and I mean like, actually covered in dirt. Flannel shirt, puffy vest thing over the top, and his eyes were bulging out of his head. That’s the one thing I will never forget. Those bulging. Fucking. Eyes. I looked at him and then realized why he had been standing there for so long. I was naked. I sleep that way, I imagine most people do. If you don’t, you should, but maybe not after reading this. I had panties on, but I was topless. At the time it was warm and I had no comforter on my bed, only a sheet and I didn’t even have the time to think to cover myself when I notice my potential murderer standing in my doorway. The kicker? When I turned the light on, he continued to stare at me…licking his lips. Literally, smacking his lips. It was obvious at this point what his intentions were originally (to rob the place), and what they had just now become when he saw me(to rape me). I jumped up as fast as I could and backed myself up against the farthest wall. I asked him what he wanted. He grunted. That was all I could get out of him, grunts. I had two weapons at my disposal. 1.) 2 20 lb weights. 2.) An electric guitar. I chose the guitar for it’s swinging power and held it up like a baseball bat. I’m sure I looked really awesome at this point. I begged him to just leave, to take what he wanted and to just leave. He didn’t move for a really long time. It felt like forever. He just stared at me as I cried and begged. Finally, he let out the most disturbing thing I will probably ever hear, “Put down the gee-tar, sweetheart.” I had just about lost it, I honestly thought I was going to faint, vomit, die, something. I knew deep down that I couldn’t move if I even wanted to. What happened next is probably the most unbelievable part of this story, but it’s honestly the only way I was able to eventually make light of the situation, and to tell the story the way I am now able to. Right after he told me to put down the “gee-tar”, he farted. Shit you not, a long, loud and otherwise impressive fart. I remember he kind of looked uncomfortable at what he had just done, but he then decided to take a step forward. All my adrenaline rushed at once and I saw him coming at me and all I could think to do was run. He realized I was going to bolt and he lunged for me and as he did, I lept up onto my bed and dashed over the other side and right out my bedroom door. It was almost too fucking easy. I don’t remember how I got down the stairs, but I got down them quickly enough. It was all a blur after that. The front door had a deadbolt but the door to our garage does not, and I realized that’s how he got in. I’m sure I didn’t leave it unlocked but I do occasionally do the things that stupid girls do. The garage door was still open a crack and that’s where I made my exit. I could hear him fumbling down the stairs but I don’t think he chased me through the rest of the house after that. I got out the garage door and had to run across a bunch of gravel and cut through to my nearest neighbors home. Not only did I nearly get raped by an intruder, but I also had the wonderful experience of banging on my 75 year old neighbor’s door, half-naked. I got in, he called the police, and while we were waiting for them, I heard a boat engine start up and leave. That’s right. A man came and escaped by boat to rob our house. I don’t think he expected me to be there, as there were no cars in our driveway and no lights on, and a lot of people know that several houses in our area are sort of “vacation homes”. The police came and didn’t really do much. I gave them my statement, and I left out the fart, which I honestly now regret but I was not in an amusing mood at the time. They scanned every room in the house but he was obviously long gone, out in the bay, having a laugh probably. They never found him. He didn’t actually get much from our house. He took the cash I had left on the counter, the toolbox from our garage, and oddly I think he stole my passport. I never found my passport after that day, and it had been left on the counter as well. Kind of weird to think about. Truth be told, this whole thing did really screw me up for quite sometime. Needless to say, all of our doors have deadbolts now, and my boyfriend has to come home every single night. I was ultra paranoid about every noise, every boat, every night in alone for at the entire year after that. Now I realize, hell, I got out of it. I’m okay. We have deadbolts now, I’ll probably be fine. In the end, some of what happened was really funny, and I do laugh when I look back on it most of the time. Sometimes I cry, it just depends on the situation. I wasn’t raised to be afraid of anything, (which is highly unnatural) and I realize this all sounds ridiculous, and it absolutely was. Shit was bananas.","Man came by boat to rob our house. I was home alone and naked. I got away. He also farted while he was in the room with me. He escaped, also by boat, and was never found.",21,M,AskReddit
"I've been always a lonely guy, this year I decided to change this and actually apply some of the stuff I've been reading on the internet since around 2009 about meeting women. So I went to a party back in April and met this girl, I started messaging her right the next day and eventually we went out on a date. Parallel to this I still went to parties in order to get new experiences. 
 When I met her she assumed I was this player who had a crazy sex life and multiple partners at once, which couldn't be further from the truth, yes I went out with multiple girls at once and she knew it, but I never had sex with any of them, this part she wasn't aware off, I played along with her player image she had of me, in retrospect it was a mistake from my part. 
 Here's the thing, she was too inquisitive about my past, other girls didn't even ask half of what this girl asked, and of course, stupid me, played along with the whole player mentality. Then a couple of weeks ago I felt bad about this whole player image I created and decided to tell her about it. Now, here's the catch, I knew she hated lies, who doesn't right? But I feel her hatred towards lies was a little bit over the top considering our relantionship status, e.g. I once ""lied"" about not talking during sex and after that I told her the ""truth"", that I actually do talk during sex, she FLIPPED OUT, I almost lost her. 
 Anyway, after I opened up with her and told her that I'm not this player guy and actually lost my virginity with her, which is true, she told me she felt like she has been living a lie for the last 5 months and to a certain extend I agree, I should have been honest with her since the beginning, but it was the whole player image which allowed me, in the first place, to meet her. 
 Then the week after I mentioned some of her weird quirks to my colleagues at college, they aren't really my friends. She found out after using my cellphone to talk to them, yes, I allowed it. She also used my facebook to talk to girls I've gone out with to make sure I didn't have sex with them, again, yes, I allowed it. Thinking back now I shouldn't have allowed it, my words should have been enough for her. 
 That's my part of the history where I fucked up. Now for her part, I would appreciate if someone could give me some pointers if this is acceptable behaviour in a relationship, I personally feel she crossed my personal boundaries. 
 She didn't like that I LIKE going to the gym. She said she didn't care that I went, but the fact that I LIKE going there, makes her feel as she is competing with the gym for my attention. 
 She was jealous of my third grade ""girlfriends"", shit, I never even kissed them I was a kid. This was 16 years ago and she tells me she feels jealously when I talk about it. 
 She told me she secretly wished that I grew tired of the gym so she could be the only thing that mattered to me. 
 She once tested me with this gym thing saying that if I didn't let go of it I wouldn't get any sex from her. 
 She needed constant reassurance that she was hot/pretty/sexy, EVEN THOUGH she never told me those things, from her perspective I have a superioty complex and calling me handsome/sexy would be bad for me. 
 When we fought, she would tell me that I wasn't the best dude avaiable for her, there were others who were less juvenile. She would also stress that she could get ANY guy SHE wants, followed by ""...and I don't even think highly of myself, I'm humble!"" 
 I once told her I accepted a cookie from a girl in class. She asked me if the girl offered the cookie only for me, as if offering a cookie is codename for fuck me. 
 I once looked at a girl walking down the street, shit, I just looked, didn't even make eye contact. She later told me she found a guy, looked him in the eyes and bit her lips, in order to get a reaction from him as revenge. 
 I feel she's really manipulative and to a certain extend, evil. I suggested her she seeked a therapist (I do therapy and it's helping me) but from her point of view she doesn't need it. 
 Another curious thing is that we were only boyfriend and girlfriend for a month or so, but she didn't consider me her boyfriend, she would tell me that I was practically her boyfriend or just ""boyfriend"" (yes, with "" "") and after the brake up she told me that I was her boyfriend. WTF? 
 I'm aware that what I did wasn't right and I don't plan on doing it again, but I feel like that if she didn't ask soooo much stuff about my past and focused more on me being with her, things would probably be a lot better. Shit, I wasn't even her boyfriend when I told her most of my ""past"", why did she need so many details? I personally didn't care about her past boyfriends and what she did in the past, I just enjoyed her being with me at that moment. 
 Thats about it. I'm still feeling sad about the brake up, probably because I'm all alone now, again. I guess the solution is to go out, meet girls, be 100% honest with them (no more lying about sex and stuff), filter the crazy ones and enjoy the others. 
 I just need some exterior points of views, how bad did I fuck up? Was her attitude acceptable? What red flags should I look out for in next relationships? I need some pointers on this whole relationship dynamics as I'm pretty new to it!","Met this girl, lost my virginity, feels like I stucked my dick in crazy. I know I fucked up as well, at least I recognize I did. She denies it and blames me for all the problems.",20,M,relationships
"I'll try and keep this short...  edit: OOPS not short. 
 I have been dating this amazing girl for almost 2 years now.  We met on a job together and after that we have been inseparable.  This is a somewhat long distance relationship, we live (give or take) 75 miles from each other... 
 About her...  She is very mature we are both in our early-mid 20's.  She pretty much makes the bread and butter in her family so she does not have much time to do anything else.  She does not really have any friends because of this.  I pushed her to go out and meet some people because I felt it would be good to step outside of her ""situation"" aka family.  She did this... 
 She started hanging out with a girl she was friends with on facebook.
Here is where it gets saucy...  This girl regularly cheats on her boyfriend, and she made it apparent that while my gf is with her hanging out she doesn't want her to talk to me on the phone.  She sighs turns up the music etc. whatever.  The first time they hung out they went to a bar, and the girl started flirting with guys in order to get them to buy them drinks.  Then she wanted my gf to ""hang out"" with one of them ""alone"".  Once I found out I told her I wasn't comfortable with this so she told her friend that she doesn't want to go to bars to ""pick up guys"". 
 My girlfriend does not drive so she is at the mercy of her friend.  A few weeks ago my gf and I made plans to hang out.  I drove the mileage and was prepared to meet my gf, we had a specific time.  Her friend was going to drop her off to meet me.  So I'm waiting and waiting, and calling her and she's not picking up the phone.  Then an hour later I get a text saying she's on her way and I would see her in 30 minutes.  I waited an hour and a half and called again.  My GF told me they have not left yet because she's hanging out with a guy and he keeps buying her friend drinks.  So I continued to wait and finally decided to go pick her up myself.  So I drive all around town looking for this bar.  Around 3:30 (we were suppose to meet at 11pm) I get to the bar they are at and they are just leaving.  So I tale them home.  (she knows this, I told her I was going to pick her up myself but I guess her friend wanted to leave before I got there).  So I finally get back with her around 4:30 and my gf is plastered (she never drinks). 
 This is a cycle, ever week she hangs out with this girl and they go to bars.  I know this is normal but this girls intentions in my opinion are just to find guys to cheat on her boyfriend with and my gf has become her wingwoman.  Now while they are out my gf does not answer her phone or texts because her friend doesn't want her to talk to me while they are hanging out. 
 My gf is very respectful and in my mind would never cheat on me.  But the fact is this girl she's hanging out with (has many problems) and is using my gf to feel better about herself, and I am not ok with that.  Lately whenever I have said anything negative towards her friend she has been sticking up for her which I double do not like. 
 And now I am at today...  They have kicked up their friendship a notch and started hanging out a lot more.  I warned my gf that this friend she has is not a good person and shes using her to get with guys but she won't have it that way...  Anyway I am moving 300 miles away while my gf is staying behind.  So lately I have been more and more wary of this friend because now she will have a lot more time to hang out with her. 
 I told my gf to get out more and find more friends than her current ""friend"" but her excuse is, since she doesn't drive she feels like it's a burden to the other person. 
 Am I justified in not approving of their friendship?  All I want is my gf to be around nice normal people when I'm gone, but she is content with this girl.","My girlfriend has no time for friends, I mentioned she should start hanging out with people so she found a girl on facebook.  Turns out this girl regularly cheats on her boyfriend and is a massive bitch.  I am moving and uncomfortable with her choice. But she doesn't have time and is uncomfortable finding anyone else because she doesn't have a car and does not want to burden them. 
 All I want is a GOOD friend for my girlfriend someone that she can rely on when I'm gone.

"Fair warning:  Sorry for the wall of text, I am on Focalin-XR for studying for an exam tonight. (Don't worry, I have to wait for a bunch of shit to print off so I had this time... I just have to make sure I can get off.) 
 Can't say I have much experience with the weed portion (it gives me headaches and feels like someone [heavy] is sitting on my chest) but I can say this much about MY experience with my doctor (physician): 
 When he asked why I thought I needed add/adhd medication I just told him what I felt like on a day to day, about how: 
 1) I had a bout with depression (thankfully family helped me through that one [Nothing damaging by the way, just didn't do anything for the entire month of February and was extremely unhappy] 
 2) Constantly had trouble staying on task (League of Legends is a helluva drug, especially since a bunch of my classes now have online assignments) 
 3) Told him about how I had tried an ""acquaintance's"" (roommates) focalin- Xr (25 mg) and that it was entirely too strong so I would like to start with something small. Also, how it had made me realize how much I had been in a fog up until that point. I had tried to just ""grit though it"" for a much longer time than I think I should have. (Now 21, M) 
 But involving me telling the doctor/office about trying somebody else's medication (a ""risky"" situation, similar to your own), I simply left it off the sheet and told him straight-up once I was in the room with him. They will ask about those kinds of things. I let him decide if it should be written down (which he did, because he legally has to). It pretty much went like this: 
 First, he asked me the standard questions: Drink? Smoke? Exercise? 
 Answered honestly: Occasionally (socially, and not to intoxication [I like to stay in control]), Hookah (socially), and Not as much as I'd like to (Part of the ""depressed"" part of my issue... everybody always says ""Exercise! It'll make you feel better!"" But getting the motivation to do that can be hard.).","Ultimately, it will come down to the individual doctor, but they are likely required by law to write down when you tell them you vape. However, I would let THEM write it down instead of you and just answer the questions honestly. At least, that's how it worked for me. 
 Hope you keep fighting the good fight and find the medication that is right for you!",21,M,ADHD
"First off wanted to thank /r/gainit for staying one of the good helpful subs out there the info and inspiration here has helped me greatly on my journey 
 Pics: [No Flex](
         [Flex]( 
 About me: I was the typical cross country running twig in high school probably topped out at 125lbs and first year in college stopped all running and went to 132lbs. I wanted to gain weight simply to stop being the little guy. Just like a good amount here I just assumed my “fast metabolism” was the cause and I was doomed to being the little guy everywhere I went. 
 Started Dec 1st 2013 132lbs 
 Current March 30 2014 151lbs 
 Diet:  
Calculated my TDEE at 2700cal and in an effort to minimize fat gains I started eating 3000cal/day and saw good gains quick some decent noob gains for sure. Started to plateau however and increased to my current 3200cal/day and still gaining consistently. At the beginning it was rough trying to down that amount of food and contemplated appetite enhancers for a bit but not really fond of throwing chemicals into my body that aren’t thoroughly studied. So I just kept force-feeding and eventually my stomach has expanded and getting those calories is no problem so I would definitely suggest just keep pushing it down.
  Diet changed from day to day but pretty much consisted of the following:
Chicken
Brown Rice
Oatmeal
Tuna
Spaghetti
Potatoes
Eggs
Milk
Weight Gainer Shakes
    -Scoop of ON Pro Complex Gainer(now named Pro Gainer) 
 - 2Tbsp Honey
-2Tbsp Peanut Butter
-1 Banana
-2 Cups of Whole Milk
-Cinnamon (because I like cinnamon)
 
 MyFitPal calculated it at 1303cal I drink this usually right before I go to be because the high amount of carbohydrates make me tired anyway. 
 While real food is by far the best I don’t think anyone would disagree. The shakes really help with pushing past those plateaus. 
 Anyways to sum up since Im just beginning not really concerned about the totally macro count just hitting the calorice goal for now and seems to be working just fine for now. 
 Lifting Routine: 
Since I knew my goal was aesthetics not necessarily lifting stats I apologize I don’t have any. I didn’t squat, deadlift or bench press I know after reading this most of yall prolly just tuned out but my spine resembles that of a question mark and these cause extreme pain to it. So I made do with other workouts and I feel I am seeing great results so far 
 Started off with a typical BB Split Push/Pull/Leg
My week looked like this: 
 [Monday – Chest/Tri](
[Tuesday – Back/Bi](
Wednesday – Leg/Abs
Thursday – Chest/Tri
Friday – Back/Bi
[Saturday – Shoulder/Leg/Abs](
Sunday – Rest 
 All Exercises were 4x10 just keeping it simple.
This split and rep ranges has shown great results for me but considering I know my goal is aesthetics this rep range has given me significant strength gains over muscle growth. When I workout with a couple buddys that look significantly larger than me I am able to lift more weight than them so going to be running German Volume Training (GVT) starting tomorrow for 12 weeks to hopefully add some serious size definitely be updating with how it goes. 
 What Ive Learned: 
 •You should never feel hungry

"My wife and I have been married for about 3.5 years now, we have an 18 month old son. I work almost full time and I go to school using the GI Bill, because I work AND get benefits from the GI Bill money is not an issue for us at the moment. My wife works a few hours 2-3 days a week.

"I'm old enough to remember the ""good old days"" of smoking on flights and having comfy, enjoyable flights. To me, the biggest change has been the flying public, not the airlines. 
 Flying used to be more expensive (I remember a RT EWR-SAN was $660 in 1980 dollars: about $2000 today) and as a result the flying public was nearly free of riff-raff. People dressed well and behaved well. Lots of politeness and knowing nods. 
 Nowadays, of course, it's all flying buses. Cram in the human garbage, sit them down and fly their fat asses from A-B with the least possible amenities. Cheap flights means Ma and Pa Kettle can fly across country to visit the grandkids three times a year. Frat boy drunks can weekend in Vegas or Miami for the price of two weeks of beer. 
 Flight discomfort has little to do with the seats or the food. It has more to do with the unbathed troll sitting next to you and the screaming infants behind you. It's the huge lines at check-in and the humiliating security checks. There is nothing to look forward to any more.

"Warning: LONG! 
 My father had remarried and they had two sons (my half brothers).  One day in early January a few weeks before my fourth birthday, my father decided to take me for a ride.  I remember being really excited as spending time with just the two of us didn't happen very often.  We rode along in his beat-up white station wagon (the kind with imitation wood panels along the outside) and counted snowflakes as they landed on the windshield.  At one point, my father says that he has to stop at an office to discuss business with someone.  We arrive at the office building and spend an excruciating amount of time talking to a man behind a large desk.  The man behind the desk gave me a tray of magnets shaped like stick-figures to play with.  After a while, my father mentioned that he was thirsty and asked if I wanted a soda.  I requested a root beer.  While he was gone, the man behind the desk started asking me questions.  After a while had passed and my father hadn't come back, I began to get quite upset.  I don't remember how I made it to the entryway of the office building.  Maybe I got up and ran there, maybe the guy behind the desk took me there to calm me down; but when I got there, the white station wagon was gone.  The man led me back inside and introduced me to my caseworker who informed me that I had been placed up for adoption.  I spent my fourth birthday in a foster home. 
 I was eventually adopted by my aunt and uncle on my father's side (my father's sister and her husband).  They provided a very loving home and it was never a secret that I was adopted.  I still saw my father and his family once or twice a year, especially on holidays. 
 I never thought that it actually bothered me until I was in my early 20's.  A lot of memories came flooding back around that time, the most prominent one being how his new wife had given him an ultimatum:  either I left or she was leaving with his two other sons.  We are all quite a bit older now.  At a funeral for one of my other close relatives, we (his wife and I, then my father and I) sat down and confronted all of the feelings that we'd kept bottled up.  I think that it has really taken its toll on him over the years.  I can't imagine being forced to make that decision.  I knew something was up when one of my half brothers came alone to visit when I was in my early 20's.  ""If we're brothers, how is it that you're not with us?""  Apparently the story was a bit more taboo on their side of the family. 
 The experience has had a profound effect on how I view relationships.  In my early relationships I would pretty much do anything to please the girl I was with.  Maybe I was trying to please that mother figure that delivered the final ultimatum.  Maybe I was just scared of being alone again.  I also used to subconsciously sabotage relationships because “nobody sticks around forever”.  I’ve pretty much gotten over a lot of that, but I realize that some things are ingrained and work to understand where my feelings are really coming from.  I hold no resentment towards my biological father or his family, never did.  We have all forgiven the past and I'm very thankful that I still have them in my life. 
 Never did get that root beer, though :/","I remember my father dropping me off at the adoption agency.

"It was a summer in the year 2005, small beach town on the coasdt of Southern California. I, at the time, was 19, hanging out with a couple buddies when we heard of a Volcom factory party in Costa Mesa. So we head over there. 
 I had 3 beers before we got to the door, so I was feeling pretty buzzed (i'm a lightweight). I show the doorman my ID and he gives me a 21+ wristband. And all of my underage friends as well. So we go in and they have a full OPEN bar and in random buckets, redstripe beer and wine. So I grab some more beer and start drinking. Before I know it, I was hitting on random young ladies with my new found self confidence. One girl came up and we started talking but I thought she was into me so I grabbed her and kissed her, but as soon as I realized she wasn't kissing me back I let go and all my friends laughed and she stormed away. 
 I wandered around asking more girls if they want to make out but none obliged, so I found myself upstairs with a bottle of cheap wine and I drank about half of it. I then meandered downstairs and by this time I was so drunk I could barely walk. I saw my friend and I said, ""watch this"" and kicked the wall and a huge picture fell off it. We were then escorted out, and by this time we were all drunk and it was around 2am. So stupidly my friend drove drunk. I blacked out for about 30 mins until I got woken up by my friend yelling at me to ""GET THE FUCK UP AND OUT OF THE CAR!!!!!!!!!!!!"" So naturally, I did. We were at a church.

"My boyfriend (22), well, now ex-boyfriend and I (19f) broke up yesterday. Our relationship was both awesome and terrible. 
 Awesome in the fact that we both cared for each other passionately and had very similar interests, including music, movies, etc. I loved him. He was my first love, first sexual partner, first everything. 
 I was his second everything, but that's another story. 
 Anyway, the relationship sucked due to many reasons, including, but not limited to: lack of trust, habitual lying, physical and emotional abuse, mental health issues. 
 We were best friends for about 4 months before we were officially ""together"" and were friends with benefits for about 2 of those 4 months, leading up to us making it ""official."" We were officially together for 10 months. 
 So yesterday, he quite unexpectedly tells me that we are now breaking up but he wants to stay friends. We've had many, MANY ""break-ups"" in the past, but every time, we decide we can hash it out and that we love each other too much to let it slip away. This time, I don't give a fuck and it seems, neither does he. 
 I love this guy, so much, and honestly, I think he's my ""soul-mate,"" but a break-up is much needed for us right now, and possibly forever. What I'm wondering is, can a couple who has been through a lot together and has both sexual and romantic energy between them, go back to being ""just friends,"" especially if there is unresolved tension due to issues in the former relationship? 
 I don't think we can. I value his friendship and his love, which is why I don't think I can separate the two now that we've been together as lovers. However, thinking back to when we were ""just friends,"" I seriously valued him and loved spending time with him. I'm just not sure I can imagine what it will be like not to touch him or hug him or kiss him when we're doing simple ""friendly"" things like watching a movie. 
 Anyway, just wondering if anyone has any thoughts and/or experience on the ""just friends"" situation after a break-up.","Boyfriend and I broke-up, is going back to ""just friends"" even plausible? 
 edit: I know that the abuse is a major factor. And I should have left the relationship long ago because of it. However, I'm mostly looking to see if anyone has had positive/negative experience with the ""friends"" thing post-breakup. My situation aside, has anyone tried this before?",19,F,BreakUps
"So im 18m, had a party a few weeks ago, girl I liked came, 20F, she was glued to me all night. End of party she was the only one who stayed over. I put her to bed in the spare bedroom. Few minutes later she came running and hopped in bed with me (This is where all my friends think that she likes me). Granted it could have been the alcohol acting. But yeah we cuddled and spooned all night, no I didn't do anything more because I didn't want her to regret anything more importantly take advantage of her. Next morning she went to the bathroom and still came back and we were just enjoying each others warmth. We were talking alot the week after that, kinda died down.

"We've been together for three years and we have a seven month old son. Please don't comment on our ages/the fact that we have a child, as I feel that it's irrelevant (not to mention that I've heard everything you'd like to say at least 1000x since I've been pregnant). We got engaged two years ago (I hate the word fiancee so I just call him my boyfriend). 
 Our relationship was great when we were younger, but now that we've put all of this responsibility onto ourselves he's starting to show his true colors. We both live with his parents full-time and although the household is civil, I see urgency to move out as I feel it's unfair to everyone involved for us to live in their home scott-free with our child. He sees it differently- he's said to me before ""we can just wait till they ask us to leave"". He's also a VERY lazy parent. I'd say I do 90% of the work with him doing 10%. His mother and I have had several conversations about his laziness and she insists that it's a part of who he is, that his father is the same way, and that if I really loved him that I would just let it go and accept him for who he is. 
 Since turning 21, ALL he cares about is drinking and gambling. He's only been 21 for 3 months so I'm giving him time to come out of it, but it's super annoying. He's not an angry drunk, and he never drives while inebriated but he spends ALL of his money on alcohol and it gets on my nerves, considering I haven't spent money on myself since our son was born. 
 He also has poor habits in work and at school. For instance, his parents paid for his college IN FULL and he's on the verge of being thrown out. He'd rather play video games than focus on getting his degree. He has a job for the weekends but he gets in trouble there for stupid shit (coming in late, dress code, etc). 
 What do I do, guys? I've talked to him about all of the above too many times to count, I feel as though I'm at the end of my rope.","boyfriend (father of my child) is lazy in all aspects of life, starting to question our future together",21,M,relationships
"Little backstory on me: 
 I'm indian-american (22 male). My parents moved to this country leaving everything they knew and everyone they loved to raise me, I was 3 months old. Everything I learned growing up, I learned fast. I was always the ""ugly kid"" and also the ""most likely to succeed"" and ""smartest"". In kindergarden I was let out for the 2nd half of the semester, placing far forward in my class. In 1st-2nd grade I learned exponents while the class recited times tables out loud. 3rd - 6th grade, teachers had a hard time teaching me, I was bored, it made me a delinquent. Sort of. I would ace any quiz, pass any verbal tests, but never did homework (50 math problems I can solve faster in my head than I can write it? no thank you). The never doing Homework thing still is a problem today. 7th grade to 9th, teachers insisted on failing me, yet pushing me into the advanced classes, I finished my statewide exams before I hit HS. 9th-12th (I should say 9th-9th-10th-10th) I was out of class literally 90% of the time. ON RECORD. I spent my days roaming the halls, and eventually became famously the IT guy. Eventually my 12th year was over and I had a 64% avg, and only passed as many classes as a starting 10th grader. Once the year finished, I took my GED that same week. Passed with a 3350. (SAT's were 1450/1600) 
 Did some college too, but that's more irrelevant at the moment. I might expand on it later. 
 My Personal life background: As I mentioned, I'm indian-american. I have 2 loving parents who speak to this day broken english. They worked from garbage men and street sweepers, to my dad having a BS in CS, and working for a firm in manhatten for the last 9+ years, my mom having a job as a nurse and full time mom of 2. Did I mention I have a sister 4 years younger than me? Anyways, I was driven hard by them, but always rebelled. Parents who hardly speak english in a country they don't know, who kept me practically cruelly sheltered growing up ( I didn't attend my first party until I was 17 ), a school life where I failed but only due to my ""laziness"". I made a choice, to achieve all my great things taking advantage of my test taking and quick learning. I decided this after HS. Turns out that works, except you have to actually want to do it, which after my first success, i didn't. This is the key here. I learned what ADHD was only 2 years ago. I've written more than 500 programs but maybe only a handful are complete. Once I'd code the short term function out, I'd be done and satisfied. I did this for amusement. When you're ADHD and your parents are racist of america, untrusting of the neighborhood (bronx), you are the weird kid, you have no friends, the only outlet I had was my dad brining home an old pentium 2 when I was 10, its all you can do. Hello internet, you were my only frand. 
 Today I moved state, dropped out of 2 colleges, play guitar, starcraft HOTS, and not much else that's routine. I can't even remember to grab my house keys from my car when I park. I have an amazing GF and 2 close friends, life is bearable. Except I long to do more with my self. I have boundless ambition, always have, wanted to cure cancer so I self studied bio and got a 66% on a practice MCAT, taught myself python,php,mysql,perl,c++,html,js and probably more for my IT career, but really for myself. Yet, I can't hold a job at radio shack and my resume has MSFT as my first employer. 
 I tried adderall xr. And I wish I could say I had a doctor even test me for anything. But I came across some. Absolutely the most different yet normal I've literally ever felt. Have had it maybe 6-12 times? First time, took me about an hour to settle it in, and then I had new found ambition. I cleaned my car, cleaned my house, cleaned my PC, did all the projects I've been putting off, did the laundry, after all that, sat down and wrote my first entire program in literally 3 years. The next couple of times I learned choose what to what needed doing. I took care of bills, taxes, spruced up a proper resume. Undid all the half assed stuff I could think of. 
 Took a few days break to see a contrast. Boy was that stark. walk into any room, ""what was i doing?"", still left keys in my car, hey did we turn the stove off? (yes, 5 times). You get the gist. I had my old attention span of a Fly. So I restarted my regimen. Again, productivity through the roof, happiness higher than I believed possible again, (think a kid discovering his seed sprouted). Until now, I had thought of ADHD as a real thing, but I never recognized it manifested in me. I've even been meaning to write this out but never could until now, guess why. I can't come across the stuff anymore, and my life is still in shambles, I can only achieve short term goals, never save up to pay rent, never remember to do shopping, can't study worth a damn without meds. I do honestly feel dependant on the meds, but only for getting shit done, not for my overall happiness, that is affected by how much shit I get done. 
 Recently I came across this subreddit and have been reading your stories. I've met them with mixed emotions and I'd love for someone to give me a helping hand. So here's the rub. I'm only self diagnosed, self medicated, and just within this month, aware of my ADHD. I feel like you guys all figured out some coping mechs for yours even when you were young and I didn't so I've screwed up a lot of my potential future. I've been taking your advice, postits everywhere, if I think I'll remember I write it down as much as I can anyways, bowl for keys by the door and what have you. Those fit perfectly into my life. I want more, I want someone to unlock my potential, show me how. I don't have the luxury of removing my distractions, I try to limit it where I can, but I've got the self control of bugs near a zapper on this. I have been obviously told to see a professional and get properly medicated and diagnosed and therapy and what not, and that is the future plan. But as it stands, I don't have the time to devote to that and neither the meds to continue to the point where I hope to have that ability. After working hard at my ADHD I got a job, a real one. I haven't started yet, start next month, its got me very anxious which has obvious stressing effects. On top of that, I've got a trip back home for a couple weeks so I need to get my affairs in order which instead of doing, I'm doing this. I doubt I'll find a doctor who will even see me before the end of july and I'm certain it'll go one of 2 ways. 1. I'll explain myself best I can, come off as sounding like a adderall seeking junkie and go back to zero 2. I'll need to take a test a week later, see my doc for results and stuff a week after, and finally a trial set of non-stimulant meds which fail and the cycle repeats for a couple months. either way, I'm ADHD i think, I've finally found a way to feel sane, have a large milestone in my life in a week, won't have any meds or help for months.","because I love you guys: 
Have what from what I understand is ADHD with a depression condition, undiagnosed until a month ago, still wont have treatment even if I try my best now until august, have a major turning point in my life in a week.

"Howdy Auburn! 
 I saw this story from this past weekend posted on an Aggie page and figured y'all would appreciate it as well. Thanks for staying classy, even when the game doesn't go the way you'd like. 
 ""I thought I should let you guys know my story from this past weekend’s trip to Auburn. 
 During the 2nd quarter of the game after the blocked field goal for a touchdown, I ended up celebrating a little too hard, and lost my Aggie Ring after high-fiving a friend. It ended up flying over my shoulder behind me about 15 yards down into the infamous hedges that surround the field at Jordan Hare. 
 During halftime there were nearly 20 A&M fans, Auburn fans, and members of the A&M band helping me look for it but we had no luck. I told everyone to forget about it for now and enjoy the rest of the game and that I would look for it after the game. 
 After the game, same thing, the Auburn police and grounds crew allowed me to take my boots off and look for my ring in the flowerbeds for about an hour (with no luck again) until I was forced to leave by security when the lights were going out. I was able to give my contact information to Eric Kleypas – Director of Athletic Turf for Auburn and he said “not to worry buddy, we’ll find it, go have fun and enjoy the win.” This guy was nothing but true class and I can’t thank him enough for all his help. 
 Waking up Sunday I thought to myself that there was no way I’m leaving town without my ring. I called Eric and he let me drive right up next to the stadium, let me enter through the media gates and I was escorted on to the field with a member of the grounds crew to help me look for my ring. I looked for nearly 2 hours Sunday morning but again, no luck at all. They walked me into the grounds crew office where I left them my contact info and thanked them for their time. All of these guys were amazing and were very sympathetic with me, even when they were really busy with work the day after the game. 
 Monday Morning: I get to work back in Houston and get a phone call from Eric saying that he had good news for me. He had gone out of his way to contact anyone he knew with a metal detector and ended up finding Robert Hensarling, TAMU Class of ’87, to come up to the stadium this morning with his metal detector. They couldn’t get the detector to work so they got in there on their hands and knees and low and behold, Robert ended up finding it after about 5 minutes. Eric said that he would mail it to me as soon as he got the chance today. I’ll say this again, this guy is just incredible. 
 I’ve visited nearly all of the SEC West schools and Auburn is by far without a doubt the best one of them all. The Auburn Grounds Crew guys are top notch as well as the Auburn fans that helped me during and after the game (even after a tough loss). Just goes to show you how great the Aggie Family is and how incredible of a place Auburn is to visit. 
 Thanks,
Layton Miller""","Man loses his Aggie ring (an Aggie's pride and joy) at the Auburn game, grounds crew and Auburn fans are the definition of class as they go out of their way to get it back to him.",21,M,auburn
"WARNING- long post
So taking 400ug of LSD should be a nice trip, but I don't think it should have been as insane as it was for me. 
 It starts at midnight, I take all four of my tested 100ug tabs of LSD in my friends car. We are driving to another friends house where there is about 7 people we all know tripping on 100-200ug. We arrive 20 minutes later and I am already full on tripping with strong visuals and everything is very dark. Nothing unusual yet, its the middle of the night so I guess everything would be dark.
We all get in the car to go to another friends house where we heard there was a party. As soon as I get in the car I black out. Next thing I know i'm a 45 minute drive from where I live at two giant lakes in upstate New York. I get out of the car very freaked out, scared of everyone I see, then stumble back into the car where I black out again. When I come back around we are driving to my house because my friends said that I was freaking out and really wanted to go home. We get to my house, and I find myself freaking out in my driveway. I sprint for my house where I dive in and lock the door behind me. Everyone was banging on the door trying to get in and was blacked out, my friends said they heard my screaming like crazy inside the house throwing stuff around. It is about 2:30 am when I get inside my house. 
 At this point in my trip I end my contact with any human. I climb up the flight of stairs in my house and crawl into bed. Upon getting into bed I lost all sense of reality. For hours I was in my bed crawling around, my body was contorting and twisting into crazy shapes and changing colors, my whole house was traveling at the speed of light through dimensions. I remember screaming like crazy because I was in so much pain feeling all of this. None of this probably actually ever happened, but my brain was convinced this was all real. Then BOOM it all stopped. I got up from bed, it was early morning, the clock read 7:21 and my vision was full of patterns across everything. I saw everything just covered in strips of acid; cool, colorful, intricate designs across every inch of my world. My body was small and completely different than it had ever been before. It was small and twisted, my limbs were black as burnt tar, and I was dented all over, my stomach went in, and my torso twisted in circles, my feet were balls, and my fingers were twisted and charred. My brain was convinced this was real, I thought I had traveled to a new realm where I had died. From the back of my head I could hear a song playing. I would think about being not really dead but in a simulation ran by a creator. I thought I was in a purgatory where spirits were deciding if I should die or be allowed to live in my own mind. They knew my twisted body wouldn't last long in a regular human world. While I as so deformed I felt as if I had super abilities and strength. I was moving across my room at super fast speeds able to move anything with no effort. The more I thought about these spirits judging me the louder music would play in my head. It went ""If you can hear me make a sign, open the DOOR"" as well as my mothers voice in my head saying ""I swear to god he needs to get out of that room"". I heard footsteps running trough the hallway outside my door and things scurrying through the walls. I was scarred to open my door though even though I could hear that music playing. I knew that if I could open it that would be the sign I needed to show that I could hear them and I could return to the human realm again. I wanted so badly to get back to my real body but couldn't bring myself to turn the door handle. Eventually the patterns cleared and the music stopped, I knew I had missed my opportunity. Upon making that realization I lost the physical ability I had and was stuck in this broken body super weak and fragile. I then open the door and make it downstairs. The scurrying started again the the walls and now I heard voiced screaming from the basement. The music began again in my head, and I ran around opening all the doors trying to find them and show the sign. None of the doors worked and the music in my head was so loud I couldn't hear anything else. I then had the great idea of lighting a fire in my kitchen below the fire alarms to show that I could hear them. Of course the fire alarm goes mad and the music instantly dies out. I thought I had done it, I was so happy I proved myself to these spirits that were in my house. I was still in the broken body so I began to make my way back to my room. When I reach the stairs I collapse in exhaustion and lose consciousness. Not sure when I wake back up, I find myself face down in a puddle of piss next to the ruins of the fire on my kitchen floor, with my walls spray painted all around me. My legs are so large and heavy that I cant move them or come even close to getting up. I lay like that at the bottom of my stairs for what feels like hours. My two cats and small dog approach me and sit in a line in front of me. I feel like my legs are getting more  and more dense and heavy and I hear someone sprinting through the upper floor of my house. The fire alarm is still going off but now it is just making a single signal to announce that it is low on batteries. The red light would tick on, my legs would fill full of energy. The red light would stop and the sound would signal. Every time the sound went every door in my house would fly open, my dogs head would twist around, and a brown minivan would circle my house. I felt as if I was dying at the bottom of those stairs. My body was filling so full of this energy that it would cause me to explode into the universe forever floating around being punished for being so stupid as to take this acid that I was now convinced was nbom. I knew I would die and that the being in that mini van was a creator coming to show me my fate. I thought that the footsteps running through my house belonged to evil spirits that would take me to this place in the cosmos. My legs at this point were completely black and so full of this energy that they weighed many tons each. My Body was so twisted it was tar black and triangular. My heart was an engine pumping this energy so fast throughout my body. My legs begin to hover in the air in front of me as they begin to float into the sky. The one cat in front of me is talking to me, telling me that I am going to suffer incredibly for being so stupid as to throw away my whole life and the whole cosmic plan for me throughout all my past and future lives for some fake acid. That destroying that plan was so incredibly stupid I would be punished for an eternity travelling in this energy through the galaxy for forever. I felt as if the being in my house would release me from this mangled body to flow with the energy in my eternal torture. There was so much going on in my head, everything was speeding up for a climax that would send me out of this world. All of the sudden it all stops. 
 My legs and rest of my body return to normal. The energy leaves my house, I no longer hear voiced or people running around. The cat stops talking and time begins to move again. It is 1 pm when this all stops, 13 hours after I originally took my dose of lsd. I repaint my walls and clean my floors, but the whole day whenever I thought of this crazy trip I would begin to hear the music in the back of my head again. At 8 pm when I still could hear the music, thought my fingers were still black and twisted, and was extremely paranoid I took an SSRI to calm myself down and end this strange trip. 
 Basically I am now aware that these things couldn't have actually happened. I didn't really die from taking LSD and experience a purgatory before returning back to earth. My body wasn't really changed to that extreme and there weren't people running around my house screaming and talking to me. I am wondering if this 400ug of LSD brought out psychosis or schizophrenia or something like that in me. I am a 16 year old male and that was my 5th time taking LSD, my first time with that large of a dose and my first time experiencing anything as crazy as that. I broke my glasses, my bed, lit my house on fire, spray painted my walls, pissed on the floor, and punched a hole in a door.

"My first time, no regrets. But how I took my best friends virginity is kind of hilarious. 
 Backstory: we met when I was 14 and he was 15, he liked me, I didn't feel the same and we were best friends for about a year before his crush got to be too much and he stopped talking to me. 
 Fast forward 2 years: I'm a senior in high school and he's a freshman in college. We hadn't spoken in about 2 years and he randomly myspace-messaged me apologizing for being a jerk, wanted to get lunch and catch up, and I agreed. Truth be told, as soon as he walked out of my life I realized I'd felt the same way but didn't/couldn't do anything about it. So, a few days later, we meet up. We had a great time together. He showed me around his university and we spent the whole day and evening together. When I left, he asked if I'd be his girlfriend. We kissed for the first time. 
 A Few weeks roll by, I'd been spending a lot of time with him in his dorm with his roommates, hanging out, drinking, et cetera. This night, however, would end differently. I'd been drinking peppermint schnapps. That shit is not as fresh going down as it is coming back up. Being 17 and inexperienced, I drank like half a bottle of this stuff before things got hazy. He'd been telling me he'd slept with girls since getting to college (he was a bit awkward in high school, not a ladies man whatsoever) and I was glad, I didn't want to take his virginity! That's really stressful! So we start making out, taking various articles of clothing off, and he starts going down on me. As I am moaning, I feel the room start to spin. I sit up much too quickly and BAM. I vomit all over him, his bed, and even onto the floor. It felt like I had snorted Listerine. My eyes were stinging from the peppermint and he just looked horrified. I immediately ran for the shower, crying hysterically while he called through the door that it was okay, don't be upset, I can do laundry, just clean yourself up. 
 I come out of the bathroom to an empty room. Bed sheets, comforter, everything is missing. The room smells like pizza and peppermint and humiliation. I scramble to get my clothes so I can bolt to my car and disappear but I wasn't quick enough. He comes back into the room, takes his pants off to reveal an enormous erection, and hops aboard my minty express. 
 I found out 2 years later I'd, in fact, taken his virginity that night. He said he doesn't regret a thing. That was 7 years ago, and we've been together ever since.","barfed peppermint schnapps all over him and his bed, took his virginity 20 minutes later.",24,F,AskReddit
"I have self-diagnosed dysmenorrhea, my cramps get really bad maybe every other month, with nausea, vomiting, dizziness, numbness in extremities, intense pain and general awfulness. To make it worse, there is little to no regularity in the schedule of when it starts, and have had to leave work and school early on multiple occasions because I'll feel fine in the morning and then later be in agonizing pain.

"After graduating with a degree in Computer Engineering In the early 2000s I found that it was nearly impossible to get a non-military job in the field in Florida. I looked for random jobs for a year or so and decided to apply for the USPS on a whim. It was almost a personal joke because I have a horrible time remembering addresses and people's names. 
 I aced the placement test and was picked up by the Sanibel post office. It was a physically demanding job. I liked the people I worked with, but most people were angry and over-worked. My job was to take over the route when the regular postman had his day off or went on vacation. 
 Half the day was spent sorting all the mail in route order. Letters come in mostly sorted, but you still have to look at every one. After sorting the mail I bundled it up and put it in the car or mail jeep, depending on what route I had to take that day. 
 You would not believe how much junk mail is thrown away. Some days I had 4 or 5 mail buckets full that was not deliverable, a stack higher than myself. On heavy days it could be twice that. 
 Junk mail was 90% of what I dealt with. The guy I subbed for was always behind on delivery of it (somewhat but not completely my fault) and some days the stacks were 6 foot high and wrapped around the cubical. 
 The regular postmen and postwomen were almost magical in how fast they would sort the mail. I got in trouble a lot because I spent too long looking at the addresses. I have a horrible memory for names and addresses and might forget the address between the time I looked at it and the time I looked at the sorting case to find where to put it.  There were thousands of things to sort every day and it got mind numbing. 
 Delivering the mail wasn't as bad as sorting, I enjoyed driving the mail jeep. 
 The worst part was dealing with the rich, old people on Sanibel. They had nothing better to do than wait for the mail. If their junk mail was an hour late they became furious. The first time I ran the route an old man, maybe in his late 80s, chased me down the block to say that I was way too late, and commenced to yell at me for over 10 minutes, making me even later. 
 One old lady owned two condos and rented out one to an even older man. She owned both so mail would come for her to both places. As a courtesy we made sure all her mail addressed next door would go into her box. Four or 5 times I overlooked her name and put her mail in the box it was addressed to. She would stand outside her door and make snide comments at me as I sorted the mail for the condos into their boxes. One time she shook a letter with her name on it but addressed next door in my face and said that Postmen only had to have a high-school degree, but should at least know how to read. I never came closer to kicking an old lady in the face. That day I learned the true meaning of ""going postal"". Fortuantly I have a cool head and just laughed at her and walked away, which I got in trouble for later. 
 While I was working at the post office one of the post-ladies died of an aneurysm caused by a blood clot. I'm not entirely sure if it was completely caused by working at the post office, but I'm sure that the work was a contributor. 
 After two years I finally decided that postal work was not for me, so I picked up and moved to Orlando to work in tech support.","I worked at the post office 2 years. Hated sorting mail, everybody was angry, saw tons of wasted paper, almost kicked an old lady in the teeth. AMA",20,M,IAmA
"But the genders aren't reversed. You're looking at an adult male who is perfectly capable of standing up, walking out of the room, and leaving. This guy, no matter how abusive the relationship, is physically capable of not letting this happen and leaving.

A man can physically hold down a woman and have his way with her.

"update 2  we got the bjorn potty chair off Craigslist on Saturday. We introduced it to our little one and let her play with it. We put it next to our toilet and sat her next to it each time we used the restroom. Today she went up to it herself so I sat her on it fully clothed. While siting on it she pooed! So proud of her. Yes she was still wearing all her clothes, but she's getting the idea! 
 update . Wow. Thanks for all the responses and support. I thinkI  should start by saying ""potty training"" is probably the wrong terminology. She seems to be able to recognize the need to urinate/deficate and is able to associate it with the sign ""toilet"". This is not the same as telling me she wants to use the toilet, but I was thinking that since she knows that association I can start teaching her the association with using a toilet for those purposes. She has peed in the toilet once and pooped in the toilet once. Both times she indicated at she needed to go and I placed her on it. I NEVER force her to sit on the toilet if she is upset by me trying to do so. This would be traumatizing and probably ruin my chances of potty training in the future. My current goal to help her learn that when she needs to go she CAN go in a toilet like a big person, NOT that she MUST. She can continue to wear a diaper and I am by means trying to teach her to hold it. I want this to be at her pace with her in control. Tomorrow I'm going to go pick up a small potty and put it next to the big one. Maybe she will enjoy sitting on it when we use the restroom and start to get the idea. Thank you. 
 Original post: 
 My daughter just turned one a couple weeks ago. She is walking and signs many words, including milk, food, water, bath, sing and more. She is learning new words all the time. When my husband and I use the restroom my tell her we need to use the toilet, we sign toilet, then we bring her into the restroom while we go. 
 Yesterday she signed toilet. Shortly after she pooped in her diaper. I was very proud of her for telling me. I then changed her and praised her some more. This morning she told me she wanted a bath. So I gave her a bath. After bathing she was playing in the water. She signed toilet. So I took her out and tried to sit her on the toilet. We bought a little seat to set on the big one she she wouldn't fall in.  She immediately got upset. I took her off the toilet. She signed toilet again then peed on the floor. I praised her for telling me again. But it seems that everytime we try to put her on the toilet she screams and cries. I think it must be scary. I've even tried giving her toys or a bottle or the breast while setting her on the toilet.","My one year old is showing signs she is ready to potty train, but she is terrified of the toilet itself. 
 Do you think that a small toilet you set on the ground would be less intimidating and scary for a one year old?

"I'm going to as honest as I can. 
 I understand if you don't grow up around a culture, that when you are thrown into it, adjusting can be difficult. I'm middle class black and I've gone through some, maybe half of what you've gone through. I've been through the, 'you're not black enough' part of my life and been made fun of publicly. I also get that black culture is sometimes more low class in the things that we do and stereotypes that come with it. What I'm concerned with though is an Us/Them comment you made. It screams inferiority complex or at least an identity crisis. I'm 23, I grew up with my dad (black) who did his best to try and avoid all the pitfalls of ""black culture"" so I went through a lot of the same feelings and thoughts that you did. I felt that I didn't fit in with that group of people. And it wasn't until later I began to get that I just didn't fit in with THOSE black people. But I did with others who weren't the stereotypical black person. But as I went through your posts and those posts of other people, I never made the distinction between US and THEM. I'm glad you were adopted by that white family and your life has, is and will be so much better because of it. But when you start saying US / THEM, you will constantly try to battle within yourself about who you are. (which I think you are) 
 Now, there's a chance I'm reading too much into this because as I've gone through the posts, you seem like someone who has found himself and what's important to you, regardless of culture. And I am 100% happy for you, but... 
 Based on the 'vibe' that I got while reading this, you've distinguished yourself from black people and not just black culture. 
 Dawg/dude/man/son/guy/buddy, (I'm not your buddy, guy!) I get it. I really do but it comes off as if you've distinguished yourself when you didn't have too. While I could be off base with this, I at least think you could see where I'm getting at, especially if you look at some of your replies. My bet is that you're still dealing this in some way. 
 And if this is way off with you, I know it will ring a bell with another redditor.

"So I'm a dude and I like guys. I was with a particular guy I liked (let's name him Drew). I wasn't sure if he was gay or not so I never advanced on him. Now here we are smoking a couple of blunts and playing video games when Drew mentions he has another blunt so I go for it. Now at this point I'm at an [8] and its the highest I've ever been. So I'm high out of mind and suddenly this guy kisses me. At first I wasn't sure if he actually kissed me or I was imagining it since I had a huge crush on him. But he did kiss me and I kissed him back. One thing led to another and suddenly we have our pants off. He's blowing me and I'm blowing him. We stop because we are about to cum so we lay down side by side mutually jacking off.being so turned on I was about to blow my load. At this point drew put his head on my belly and started kissing it when I shot everywhere including on his face. Normally this wouldn't be bad but when I finally opened my eyes I saw what happened. There was blood everywhere! And it wouldn't stop coming out of my penis. Drew is covered in blood, I'm freaking out because I'm bleeding out of my pee hole, and Drew is horrified. 
 Fuck I really liked this guy. I don't know why there was blood in my semen. I'm going to see a doctor. I'm not very sexually active so I'm pretty sure its not an sti or something.","it was my time of the month. 
 Edit: OP wasn't a fag. Well kinda. Here's some of the bloody cum.  The rest was on Drew's Face.

He said it should clear up in a week and if it doesn't that I should go back. So have that going for me. As far as Drew goes, I texted him asking if we are going to have lunch tomorrow like we do every week and he said yes. I'd rather have this conversation on the phone and see what happens.

"Hello to all my motivators, inspirer's and losers! I've been here reading all about your successes and couldn't be happier for you <3 Today, because of the focus and drive your stories have brought me, I'm able share one of my own. 
 I had been dealing with a lot of emotional and depression issues being tied to my sexual orientation. (I knew I was gay when I was so young and fell in love with a cartoon character). I finally had the audacity of telling my parent, who didn't cut all ties to me and disown me to my surprise. Because of all my inner turmoil and eating my emotions, I was mid 20s and well over 345. I could only fit in guys clothes and didn't realize how unhappy I was! With help from a good friend of mine and support from my sibling and I had decided to change turn things around and got to 339 and eventually 315. 
 I was stuck at 315 for 6 months until I came out, which pulled a huge burden off my shoulders, then I reached out to reddit for advice on why I wasn't losing weight - you lovely bastards gave me the tough love I needed. I was encouraged to  COUNT MY CALORIES  and sure enough the scale started moving down. I currently claim 343 as my starting point as it's my highest recorded and 339 as thats when I axtually focused on weight loss. I'm not sure just how big I got but as of yesterday I'm at 278! That's 65lbs AT LEAST  GONE . 
 On to my NSV - I was wearing size 42 pants that were honestly snug, and XXL shirt. I currently fit fine in my extra XL shirts that I've saved and most of my pants and shorts are too big. As a way to celebrate, my parent took me out and bought me a new outfit. I went from a size 22w to 16! And from 3x to ~1x (flabby arms restrict me). I'M SO CLOSE TO BEING OUT OF THE PLUS SIZES, something I haven't been able to do since elementary school! So I get home after changing into my new clothes and my roommate is relaxing in his room. I asked him if I looked funny as I was NOT used to wearing girl clothes and was going to an event and to later meet up with friends. We've known each other for 8 years and he's never seen me in girl clothes and his following comment was - ""you look like a girl... A hot girl!"". Not to mention the lovely comments from my friends last night. 
 I can't believe I got this far. I'm on cloud 9 and so relieved to feel normal!. I have a long ways to go but am glad I'm carrying my weight well and having the support of all of you lovelies. I really don't know where I would be without your stories that encourage me to get my own victories.

"Im on mobile so sorry for any grammar or spelling. Yes we are both 17 and just ""kids"" but it's a lot more complicated than that. Anyways my girlfriend and I started dating in April of 2014, things were amazing back then we had the same interests, did everything together, and basically spent every second with each other. It was the first time I can say I was in ""love"" because being with her made me feel happy and just all around good. It even made me feel good enough to get out of the whole party scene I quit smoking and going out drinking to be a better person for her. Well things went down hill after about a year. She told me she was bi polar out of the blue one day and i thought nothing of it since there was never any problems before. She started to develop this attitude right after telling me like really bad. Things like me disagreeing with her turned into fights that lasted all day, she screams at me for things I've done my entire life like not cutting steak into pieces [idk why this was such a big deal], or wearing certain clothes and telling me I look like a ""faggot stoner."" I kind of let it go and took it. Shortly after that she got controlling. I found my self not hanging out with friends anymore because she would worry and say she don't trust me with them, if I didn't text her within 3 mins she'd flip out and accuse me of not caring for her and talking to other girls. I figured it was just cute innocent jealousy and never got mad about it. It got to the point where if I didn't text her back she'd tell my mom and have my mom message or call me to make sure I'm okay and I lost a lot of respect for her after this. And she still does this to. Eventually we fucked up and we had an abortion and we fought like mad because her mother made her get it and told the doctors that i wasn't around so I had no say. Ever since then it's been worst she gets mad at me for EVERYTHING I'm afraid to say anything without starting a fight, then she apologizes, then blames it on me, then apologizes again, then says it's my fault I piss her off. It's so confusing and frustrating. The things her and I have been through and the feelings I have for her is whats making me stay. I want to leave because Im controlled. I haven't been with friends in over 5 months, I have to secretly text others, and I'm afraid if I do leave eventually shes going to go INSANE because she already has gone mad from me mentioning it once. Im not sure what do. I want to be happy have friends and start a life once I graduate in May but she's holding that back telling me to wait for her, move in with her, and get married to start a family. She's also trying to tell me I AHAVE to go to college right away with her. I don't even know if I want to go to college. Please help what should I do? Thank you!

"Me and my Girlfriend are in are 20's and we are from kentucky and do not live with each other, We have been in the relationship for about 1.5 years. 
 Recently I have come to an emotional halt with my girlfriend. Like all feelings have vanished and I have no clue what to do, if I should let it continue and my feelings will magically fix themselves, or let her go because its not fair for her if she has emotions that I don't have for her or even possibly talk to her but I have no clue what I would even say to her. I have been happy in the relationship with her all up until recently, which now I have mixed emotions. We hardly argue, and when we do, it is usually a big mess which takes a little time to repair, I always remember the fights and I don't think it is helping me at this time either. 
 I still care about her feelings and I don't want to hurt her at all. She has always kept me happy and I have tried my best to make sure her days and life are enjoyable, making sure she is okay and if she was down I would always cheer her back up. 
 That is why this is so difficult, because I have no clue what to do. I don't know if she browses reddit, she doesn't really go on her computer much.","No longer have strong feelings for girlfriend, No one else is involved. Don't know if I should break things off or try to revitalize things.

I support most of her costs, she works and she has a job, she pays for her bills and I pay for all the entertainment.

"I'll have a go. 
 From about 18 til 32 pot was a daily affair for me.  My last year of being chronic, easily an ounce a week. 
 At the time I would have told you its cool, no side effects, however since being clear from pot since then here are the things that I see in hindsight. 
 1) Memory --> My short term is much better since I quit.  Long term is more or less the same, but I would lose shit all the time back when chronic.  Now the only time I lose keys/hats/wallet is when my wife moves it to a ""better"" location and I go on a rage at 0430 when I am trying to find my car keys to go to work. 
 2) Analytical thinking -->  I have always been pretty lucky in that I am not a stupid man.  My thought process have certainly sharpened, and I process information much better now.  Pot definitely added an ADD quality to my life.  SQUIRREL!!!!! It took about 2-3 years to really notice the difference, but its there. 
 3) Motivation --> When I was chronic, it was always tomorrow man, tomorrow.  This, to some effect, is still there.  I work hard to keep myself motivated, but it gets easier all the time.  Doing physical  activities outside of the computer/xbox is much easier now that I am not high all the time.  In example, hitting the weights and elliptical. 
 4) Addiction --> Not me.  I could always put down the pipe, and when I finally quit, there was no issue what so ever.  No withdrawal, no cravings nothing.   That said, I have seen people jones pretty bad for a toke, which leads me to conclude that there is something to an addiction to pot, mental or otherwise. 
 5) Gateway --> Not a chance.  Any time I did harder stuff it was because I chose to.  Had nothing to do with chasing a better high.","Over all, better short term memory and motivation to do self improvement chores, but really that's all.  Toker for 14 years.",32,M,AskReddit
"I've been a lurker for a long time on this subreddit because I didn't feel like there was anything I could do to change my situation. Now, things have heated up and I really need help. 
 I just recently graduated high school this past June. I've always been an ""A"" student, and I took hard classes so I could get into a good college. This year, I plan on attending community college because money is tight, then transfer to a Cal State. My Ndad has always pressured me to get a job and help pay for rent and other things. Because of the school load, I have never really had time for a job. Lately, he's made attempts to gain more control over me and my future, like threatening to not pay for my tuition and kicking me out of the house. He's already kicked me out several times, so I know he's not bluffing. 
 Today, he just informed me that I have until October 1st to get a job and help pay rent and car expenses. If I don't pay rent he kicks me out. He also stated that he will not give me any money for anything anymore. I have to pay for my own gas, tuition, food, etc. I don't have a job right now, and I only have about $300 dollars in my bank account from some volunteer work. 
 I'm at a loss of words. I don't know what to do. This throws off my plans because I planned on taking a lot of classes in community, so I could transfer to University quicker. In order to pay for all this, I'm going to need a full time job. But, if I have a full time job, I can't focus on my education. I don't want to end up homeless, but I also can't be in this house anymore.

"About a year ago today I finished getting my CELTA in NYC. I was so incredibly excited because I figured this would really make me a great candidate for JET. 
 I started volunteering for shelters, teaching English to Asian women who came out of sex trafficking or abusive homes. It really sounded like a great cause, and the Japanese government had funded this non-profit. I hoped this would also increase my chances of getting into JET. 
 I started teaching full time in a school with a really high Japanese population to practice my Japanese, and I've been teaching at this school for almost a year now. 
 I got 2 stories published. I started speaking to producers at NPR to tell a story of mine on The Moth, things fell through. I started writing teaching guides and became the top Level 0 teacher in my school. I tried my absolute hardest to make myself a 100% JET pick. 
 I got put on the Alternate list. 
 I am not white. My mother and father are from Afghanistan. I have a beard. I have dark skin, curly hair, am 6'0"" and physically fit. I am an American. I was born in New York City, and I lived here my whole life. My dream since 13 has been to teach in Japan. No I do not sit in my room and watch anime all day long. 
 Looking back at my interview it was obvious the head interviewer did not like me as he insulted me 3 times during the course of the interview calling me ""arrogant"" for assuming I 'thought Japanese people would like me'. I was confused about what he had meant, as all I had said was ""I like to hike, and I'm an amateur boxer."" I assumed all JET interviews went this way, but talking to ex-JET's it seems I was wrong. 
 I didn't want to do any of the jukus since I felt that with a CELTA, and almost a year of experience teaching in NYC that I was a bit over qualified, so I started looking around. 
 I applied to Westgate, hoping 'okay these guys are more academic they don't care so much about you being perceived as American'. This morning I got a rejection letter from Westgate claiming ""we really hope you apply again, but you have no experience teaching in Asia so we can't give you this position."" 
 My boss, who taught in Japan for a few years, has been helping me look for jobs in Japan as we've gotten closer. I think she's been realizing that as a white woman in her 20's getting a job in Japan is much easier for her as she sees all my applications get rejected where she claims ""there's no way they'll say no, you're basically offering to work for free"" to my GaijinPot ads. 
 I have no idea what to do. 
 It seems like wherever I apply in Japan I get insulted and told I'm ""not American enough"", or have no experience teaching English abroad. I have no idea what to do.

"I'll tell my story as it might pertain to the thread. 
 When I was a kid I was very skinny and awkward looking. I really didn't attract any girls. I can remember a few times where a girl would like me but it wasn't the girls everybody was chasing after. To make a long story short, I was skinny and awkward. If people care enough I'll go find a picture of me in highschool vs. now and it'll give you an idea. 
 I think I've grown into my body a bit and I picked up weight training and  fitness as a major aspect of my life. Let me tell you, that whether or not my face is pretty (I've never thought of myself as overly attractive but I certainly don't lack any confidence in the looks department) my body changing was an incredible experience. 
 I went from 6'2 and 140lbs skinny awkward guy 
 To 6'2 175lbs lean muscular build with visible abs (6 pack I guess) 
 I also made a very clear decision to stop letting hesitation hold me back. I mean that bastard still gets in the way but I do everything I can to go approach the girl, talk someone up, do what I want to do, have fun and be less introverted and removed. 
 So basically let me describe my life when I made all of these changes and it will show you both sides of living. 
 Highschool : I was skinny, awkward, not very experienced with girls but not a total social introvert either. I had plenty of friends and people liked me, but I never really did much. I didn't attend parties, I didn't leave the house much and I spent most of my time playing video games and mainly WoW (Since Reddit seems to associate that with an awful life). I never had a girlfriend and I was often mistaken for a quiet guy or somebody who doesn't have much to say. 
 This ended at 17 and I went to College where nothing really changed. But then I dropped out of a program I didn't enjoy and joined the military. After spending my time with alpha males and really getting a good grasp on what it takes I decided that I wanted to experience life as the life of the party. 
 College : I started bulking up but I wasn't huge. I weighed in around 165lbs and had some definition building into my body. I walked around to every room in residence and threw a massive party on day one and kept up being social for the entire first year. I would walk down the hallways and people would come up and talk to me like we were best friends. I didn't even know who they were most of the time so I would just smile and follow along pretending like I was interested until we'd part ways and I'd agree to have a drink with them at the next party we're both at or something. I had a large group of friends I would see all the time, pretty much on a daily basis. I always had someone with me everywhere I went and it was very rare to go do anything (even buying groceries) without some cluster of friends around. I would be stopped by random people and asked what was going on this weekend because I was the guy that should know these things. When it came time to have someone organize things people would just look at me immediately and assume that would be my job. Everybody was super nice to me all the time and I was welcome anywhere I wanted to go. Most people started wanting to be around me because of the perks they figured out it would bring. This directly related to girls, for the first time in my life not only was I pretty good friends with multiple hot girls, but they would call me up and make plans. It felt extremely foreign, shit my entire life if I wanted to spend time with anybody female it was 100% on me to suggest something. I kept working out and keeping myself in shape, and I wasn't oblivious to what was going on. It felt like an extremely interesting social experiment. I was popular and I felt like the king of everything. People started calling me Captain Matt instead of just Matt and my word felt like law at least among my friends. If I said ""This person sucks they aren't coming with us tonight"" then they literally wouldn't come with us. 
 The world treats you better, one of the biggest changes I noticed apart from the popularity of being more attractive was the comments. I always assumed more attractive people got comments from the opposite sex or a homosexual of some sort but that wasn't the case at all. I've probably been complimented (In an underhanded fashion) by more straight men than anything. Guys are jealous and they drop little comments all the time. Everybody treats you better and life just becomes very very easy. Jobs basically fall from the sky, everybody wants to help you out, some people have suggested I start modeling and how easy the money would be. Other friends suggest I do something like serve drinks shirtless at a gay bar. 
 I feel like a very unique individual because I have seen both sides of living and let me tell you, being attractive and sought after is WAY easier. But if you don't know any different it becomes very hard to develop as a human being. We thrive and succeed from challenge, not from simplicity. I think life is much easier for attractive people but much better for those who struggle. You really don't get the full experience if you don't learn how to appreciate things. I could probably type all day about this story and I feel like I already have, but if your question is genuine then I hope this helps to answer it.","I went from skinny nerdy and mostly alone, to fit super social and popular.",24,M,AskReddit
"Hello /r/medical!  I'm a 29/m with some symptoms that really sound like inguinal hernia, but my GP and specialist are confident it's not and it's just symptoms of epididymitis lingering.  Wanted to see others' thoughts on what I've been experiencing. 
 History: 
 I woke up one morning in late Jan this year with an ache in my left testicle.  Went to my GP who pretty quickly pinpointed a tender epididymis and put me on Cipro for 1.5 weeks.  Most of the ache was gone a couple days into it and I was left with... not sure how to describe it.  A very mild sensation... I wouldn't even say heaviness, but just a general ""awareness"" of the testicle.  Kind of like how you're aware of a numbness on your skin without really feeling anything.  Anyway, that feeling persisted in my left testicle after the cipro and for a few months after.  It never bothered me and it passed out of mind eventually. 
 New Symptoms: 
 Then one day in May that same testicle retracted into my inguinal canal (over the pelvic bone) after ejaculating (never did that before and freaked me out).  Still no pain, discomfort, discharge or anything, etc.  But from then on I had a feeling of discomfort in that lower left abdomen/inguinal region.  As I started paying more close attention to the region, I noticed a bump or some sort of swelling.  Only really visible when I lean back, push my pelvis forward, and flex my lower abdominals, but the location coincided with the discomfort. 
 I started WebMD-ing the new symptoms and everything pointed to inguinal hernia.  The bump, being much harder to find when lying down, being able to push in on it and feel it sort of come back in when I stopped, blowing my nose in the morning and feeling a sort of ""squishy pop"" in that lower left inguinal area, getting an ache after exercising, a mild burning sensation, etc. 
 Recent events and current concerns: 
 I went back to my GP who just said the retracting testicle was normal and to take advil for the discomfort until it went away.  I asked about my hernia concerns and he quickly dismissed the possibility.  Not satisfied with this, I found a urologist to take a 2nd look.  He found that the epididymis was still tender and spotted the region with the inguinal bump as well, saying that the infection had spread into the canal.  That seemed to answer all the questions.  I asked him about a hernia anyway, though, and about the weird pops I'd felt on occasional mornings.  He did a pretty thorough hernia test (during which I felt a pop occur because I'd just stood up from lying down during his initial exam) and said he didn't feel anything unusual.  Then he put me on doxy for 3 weeks, which I've just finished the other day. 
 There's no longer anything weird about my testicle, and the discomfort in my inguinal area has largely subsided.  But the swelling or ""bump"" can still be felt and that morning pop is still happening on occasion.  I've read that it can take months for epididymitis symptoms to completely clear even after the pain and infection have left.  I'm hoping that's all that's going on, but that squishy pop doesn't seem right for epididymitis and fits inguinal hernia pretty well.  I haven't had an ultrasound, but everyone who's examined me is very confident that I don't have a hernia. 
 So I wanted to take to Reddit and see what people thought of these supposed epididymitis symptoms vs the traditional inguinal hernia symptoms.","I had epididymitis.  The pain cleared up.  Noticed a bump/swelling in inguinal area with hernia-like symptoms after retractile testicle incident.  Urologist said epididymitis is still there and spread to inguinal canal, gave me AB, hernia test negative.  Pain is gone now, ABs done, but bump remains and occasional ""squishy pop"" in the region upon blowing nose, coughing, or otherwise straining lower abdominals in the morning.  Is it still the epididymitis healing or could I have an inguinal hernia?

"I'd like to especially emphasize this point. My interest in GamerGate looked something like this: 
 1) Allegations of sleeping with reviewers in exchange for coverage 
 Game reviewers have had a long history of biased coverage due to various financial incentives, and knowing how tightly knit these groups were, it wouldn't surprise me at all if this sort of thing was going on. 
 That said, all they would have needed to do to appease me was issue a public apology stating they'd be more careful about disclosing possible conflicts of interest and I'd have been satisfied. 
 2) A dozen ""Gamers are dead"" articles are simultaneously released, ignoring the issue of corruption 
 Again, I was pissed but not surprised. I'm  very  familiar with corrupt journalism, and I know that there's a lot of content repackaging and self interest driven reporting among lower tier news outlets. The sexism claims were annoying but expected, and I've taken issue with female representation in games for a while now, so I didn't even mind it being brought up as a discussion topic. 
 That said, the fact that these all happened simultaneously pretty much confirmed my suspicions of collusion, and I fully expected the sites involved to receive some serious flack for their blatant display of collusion. 
 At this point, I would have needed to see a handful of serious apologies and talks of the people responsible being fired before I would have felt satisfied. This was a serious issue, but still not one that was unmanageable. 
 3) Near universal silencing of discussion related to corruption 
 This is where GamerGate went from a scandal to a legitimate existential threat. 
 Public discussion has always been the equalizing force on the internet, and it's the reason I'm so attracted to sites like Reddit. I know that no matter how shitty the article is, there will usually be someone who's informed about the issue to call them out on their bullshit in the comments section. 
 When discussions about corruption started being removed en masse, I realized that games journalists were beyond the point of redemption, and when the censorship spread to sites like Reddit and 4chan, I began to start legitimately panicking. Public discussion was the single trump card that online reporting had over the rest of the mainstream media, and it's the reason I've chosen to get my news through sites like Reddit for years now. The fact that this could be taken away so easily was an amazingly eye opening experience. 
 At this point, I don't even know how the sites responsible for this mess could fix the situation, and I'm not even sure they're the source of the problem. The issues we're facing extend far beyond poor journalism. 
 GamerGate's intensity and devotion to these issues has been downright amazing given the incredible amount amount of vile it's been forced to endure, and I hope to see it continue to grow. It's done an amazing job of addressing issues of journalistic integrity, and a culture of skepticism is beginning to form that I hope will extend far beyond the games industry.",The issue of silencing voices extends far beyond games journalism and would be reason enough alone to keep this movement alive.,20,M,KotakuInAction
"Hi Reddit, 
 Thanks in advance for reading this and any insight/encouragement you can provide. I guess I don't really have a question just want some positive reinforcement to see this relationship out. 
 We started dating only 5 months ago but given we've been through the holidays, new years, valentines day and her birthday the relationship got really intense, really fast. 
 I'm a relationship kind of guy, especially when it comes to sex, I'm 27 and have been with 14 women (lost my virginity at 15), only one time did I ever have sex outside of a committed relationship (even if it wasn't romantic at least committed) and my # feels high to me, but I'm neither proud nor ashamed. I went to college, was in a frat, and had countless opportunities to have drunken meaningless sex and I simply could never do it. Like literally my penis would not let me even if I wanted to, I could not get turned on by a drunk girl I didn't know, just always felt super weird and I never understood how my friends could do it weekend after weekend with stranger after stranger. But I didn't really judge either... Until now. 
 My girlfriend is 23, and I made a big mistake in asking her #. She's a lot more casual than I am about sex, has never been in a longterm relationship, and was kind of a ""party girl"" in college.... she's been with 27 men (12 in high school, 15 in college) and I've been letting it torture me ever since I found out a month ago. One things for sure, I will NEVER ask an SO their # again. 
 I truly want to not care and constantly tell myself ""you can't judge someone for things they did before they knew you"", I also feel like a hypocrite because its not like I'm a virgin and a woman could easily turn the judgmental standards around on my own past. For example I experimented with drugs in college, so theoretically a girl could think ""well I can't be a guy who used to do drugs!"" and that would really bother me because I no longer do and never will again. Is it the same thing with being promiscuous?? 
 I'm also confused on how to handle it, we have pretty good communication and she knows something has been bothering me but I'm very hesitant to bring it up because I feel like nothing good can come of this conversation... whats done is done, its in her past, I'm sure she's different now as she doesn't party anymore. So will bringing this up only be a form of ""slut shaming""?? Would it at least help in regards to her at least knowing what is bothering me?? 
 I thought I would just get over it but its been in the back of my head for almost 6 weeks now, its effecting our relationship and I'm even considering endings things because of it, which feels really shallow to me but at the same time it truly bothers me to my core. I feel like I just can't really trust someone that's slept around that much, I feel like it makes the sex we have less special, I feel like ""just another guy"" even though I know how important I am to her, and she's very important to me. 
 Is this just my own insecurities coming out?? Or is it natural for someone of my mentality on sex to feel this way?? I feel like its almost a deal breaker and I just need to find someone else exactly like her but with a different attitude towards sex... Even though her attitude on sex might be changing because of me. 
 Any advice or support is much appreciated.","I'm starting to fall in love with my girlfriend but made the mistake of asking how many guys she's been with, now I feel like I'm dating an ex-slut and it bothers me even though I feel like it shouldn't.",27,M,relationships
"I've been on a leangains cut for close to three months now. 
 So far so good, but the changes that I experienced have left me with a lot of questions that I can't really answer. 
 I started at 90 kg at 1.86m, 29 years old. According to TDEE calculators (just did a quick re-check on both  and IIFYM) my TDEE is around 2250 cals for no activity and 2600 for light activity. 
 I decided that I will not take into account the 3 workouts per week when calculating my calories and went with the 2250 TDEE. I thought that if I saw too much weight loss I could always adjust upwards. 
 So, on my rather aggressive cut (-10%/-30%), this put me at roughly 2050 cals on workout days and 1600 on rest days  with a total weekly deficit of around 3200 cals. 
 I've been doing mostly pyramid training (not reverse) and my last week's maximum numbers have been deadlift 100kg, bench 75kg, squat 75kg.
Starting numbers are not really relevant as I was a complete and utter beginner, but roughly 60kg deadlift, 50 kg bech, 55kg squat.
I can't do pull-ups (or chins) for the life of me. 
 In the 3 months that I did this, I lost 3 kg. However, looking in the mirror, the difference is much more noticeable than that (to my eyes at least). 
 Now, my questions are the following: 
 
 Is my TDEE actually 2250 (or perhaps even lower) since the weight loss is roughly on par with what was expected? Could it be possible that my fat loss was more severe than that but on the scales it was off-set by some muscle gains? (""did i just recomp by mistake?"" - silly, i know) 
 
 Since my lifts have kind of plateaued, should I look at increasing my calories? Perhaps even re-evaluate them based on a 2600 TDEE. I am not looking to bulk, I would still like to cut some 4-5 kg of fat. 
 
 Since I do not believe that RPT is for me just now, as I am still a beginner, would you recommend that I follow [Andy's Big 3 routine]( 
 
 
 I know that it's kind of silly, but it's been bugging me for some time.","I thought I had under-estimated my TDEE by 350 cals per day. Used this for reference and weight loss was around 1kg/month but I feel like my strength has plateaued. Should I continue or increase my cals?

"So, I have a very specific question and I don't really know where to post it, so, here goes...
I am 35, male, and recently diagnosed with depression, and subsequently I have begun taking antidepressants.  In the process of beginning this journey out of depression, I find myself being more attracted to men. 
I have always publicly identified as straight, but, being human and 100% honest, I would probably classify myself as 75/25 bi, meaning 75% straight with 25% gay.  That being said, since I have been on antidepressant medication, I find myself being more and more attracted to men. 
Has anyone else ever experienced this?  Is it common for sexual orientation to fluctuate throughout life changes, or am I experiencing an awakening of repressed sexual desire that may be a permanent transition?  I know this is kind of an odd question, and yes, I am in therapy and I am trying to work through these issues with my therapist, but I was just curious if this is something that anyone else out there might have experience with.

"When I was on anti-depressants, my sex-drive decreased a  lot . When I was horny, masturbating was almost too frustrating and was often times more trouble than it was worth.

Pathetic, but true. I was on antidepressants from ages 15 - 19. During that time, I never once had an orgasm from sex, only from myself (which is fairly normal for women, except I couldn't even make myself orgasm like I could before and after antidepressants). Until I met my husband, the only person to ever give me an orgasm was me. I'm not sure if it was antidepressants or that my husband was the only person I'd been with whom I loved and trusted (and who rules at sex), but I have lots and lots and lots of orgasms now and some days I think my husband might wish my sex drive would cool off a little bit.",Antidepressants fucked with my sex drive/ability to orgasm but I'm off them now and I orgasm a lot so life rules.,19,F,sex
"So for the first time in my life, I have a girlfriend. Despite our relationship being fresh (we've been dating for about 4 months now), I am very clingy, worrisome, and sometimes even controlling sadly. I know part of the problem (or most of it) comes due to my beta male tendencies lol. I didn't want to accept it at first, but eventually I took notice that I can be a whiny bitch, and I bet no girl wants that. 
 Despite my own issues, my girlfriend has done some questionable things, but to be quite honest I think these problems came from my beta male tendencies / insecure nature. Another issue that is neither of our fault is the distance, we met out of town so even though she's back in town for the holidays shes gonna be going back to school soon. LDRs are tough lol. 
 To touch down on some of my issues, I always go in a state of panic / anxiety / depression when my girlfriend tells me she is going out. At first it wasn't a big deal I guess, but this one night she went out clubbing. I tried to maintain constant communication with her, and I myself was actually out drinking too. It's like we were in a competition of making each other jealous (her sending snaps with guys, me sending snaps with girls). This led to her sleeping at some guys house (apparently he tried to kiss her that night, but she managed to sleep over and apparently ""nothing at all happened"", wtf?). 
 I forgave her since this was really early in the relationship (prior to this incident we only hung out twice during her reading week, so we didn't really know each other that well). I also remember a couple of weeks before she actually went out clubbing a night, but I guess I didn't like her as much because we'd only text and weren't comfortable yet talking on the phone / face timing. Obviously since I wasn't as interested and I didn't show signs that I'm a worried pussy, she decided to call me that night saying she shunned off some guys that tried to grind on her / buy her drinks, and told a certain someone (same fucker I was talking about, guy who's house she slept at) that she was ""seeing someone."" (this guy really liked her) It made me feel good, and I just sit back and think like ""damn I wish she'd talk to me now like she did back then"" 
 I think I got so damn insecure because after so many video calls and great conversations I managed to really like her, so I got afraid of losing her. She's also a year older than me, extremely cool / chill, and hot as fuck (all my friends agree). She's pretty much out of my league, but I don't want to feel like a lesser man in this relationship. If anyone has advice on overcoming insecurities and what not I'd love to hear them. I get impulsive sometimes and call her out for stupid shit like when I see a that a guy snapchats her or whatever. It's pathetic lol. On a positive note, the sex and all that has been amazing for both of us.

"Hey fellow redditors, how do I make a difference? (What a vague and dumb question, I know) 
 Quick background: 3rd year in college, majoring in aerospace engineering and computer science, so I got a couple of more years to go. 
 There are many issues that are of great concern to me. Being a CS major, I see issues like ""piracy"", patents,  and privacy a great deal. I've also been paying more attention to things such as the violation civil liberties and abuses of the law. (eg. Guantanamo Bay, and absurd interpretation of wiretapping laws to charge citizens recording police officers in public). I don't feel like going into specifics on why I think these are important issues because if you're on this site often and read the comments, my opinions fall with the majority's. 
 And I'm coming to realize that just reading about these various issues that make my blood boil and donating money to various groups (ACLU, EFF) might not be the best way. 
 I've recently come to consider whether trying to going to law school to learn more about the legal system and using my (future) legal expertise to help mold a better future. I'm confident in my abilities to meet the challenges of getting into law school, so that's not a huge concern for me. 
 While I do care to be financially stable, I really don't care much to make a great deal of money. I'm somewhat ""anti-consumerist"" and try to live a minimum lifestyle. I'm definitely not wanting to do this for the money, I just want to make a fraking difference. 
 There surely must be someone out there who is in a similar situation as me. Any advice? Anything at all? Thoughts? 
 Am I being naive in thinking this is a good way to go about making a difference? Are there other, better ways? I'm not suave enough or interested in PR games to become a politician.","engineering/cs student thinking about going to law school to try to make a change in the laws.

 A couple weeks ago she started having some symptoms and a couple pregnancy tests later she found out she is pregnant.

"I bit my nails for my entire life, (I'm 19 now) and I always wanted to stop, but had failed with every single method. I adapted to the horrible tasting stuff, the method where you leave one alone, then another, etc until you've stopped. That never worked for me, because I started doing it subconsciously. It took the proper motivation for me to get my head down and think. For me, as a metalhead, it was the Download festival 2012. Holy fuck, I couldn't miss that. So my parents said they'd buy me a ticket. If I stopped once and for all. Fuck. 
So I came up with the solution. I thought, I can't rely on substances, I can't count on my ability. So the only thing left was to remove the chance. The next day I bought some medical tape and bound up every finger. I didn't just bite the nails, I had removed the skin on every finger up to the mid-joint. (It was vile) I replaced it daily, wore gloves when I could.  Once you remove the ability to bite, you remove the habit. I stopped. But I wasn't convinced, so I began to remove the tape finger by finger over the course of a few weeks. I didn't bite them. For the first time in 19 years I could cut my nails. The Whole process took about a few months, then a few weeks for the unravelling. I couldn't tell if my parents were happy or sad.

 -Rubber band technique-   Another gentleman (JC BOOM ) turned himself into the pavlovs dog of the biting world, he put a band round his wrist and snapped it everytime he was biting. Untill he associated the whole thing with pain, a few relapses,but putting the band on seems to be the trick. 
 -getting your friends/family/co-workers to kick your ass into submision-  I tired this, telling everybody to punch you if you're biting. It didn't work for me, but worth a shot! 
 -meth- juhesihcaaa has stated that a woman in a gas station told her she stopped after she took meth. Every      little helps I guess. (I'm not actually condoning drug use)

"Hi /r/relationships. 
 From the get-go, my roommate has been kind of a disaster. When we conversed last summer, I told her I was looking for someone I could get along with, someone who would do their chores, and someone who I meshed well together. She seemed very enthusiastic about all of this, and was a really nice girl, so I accepted. 
 Upon move in, I cleaned both our rooms (the previous tenants left it a MESS) and was hoping she'd be there soon to help me move in, and I could do the same for her. I texted her all day, and got no response most of the day. Around 7-8pm, I was getting out of the shower after hauling ASS all day, to which she shows up with a few friends. I suddenly get excited, and start to help her move stuff in. After two trips, she says, ""Okay so-and-so and I are gonna go grocery shopping, need anything?"" I thought the gesture was nice, but said no.  She didn't come back for two days. God knows where she went. 
 That story pretty much depicts our roommate-relationship. She comes in at weird hours (1am-4am usually), she does  zero  work in this house (I have been doing all the dishes, taking out all the trash, I don't think she's picked up the broom once). When she is in the apartment, she has friends over or is having parties in her room (she had a 20+ person party one night giving me 2-hour notice, I had a test to study for.) She has given people our apartment keys, and without warning random-ass people have shown up and I have no idea who they are. For Spring Break, she offered her place to someone random  without  notifying me, and I had to kick the girl out into the hostel she was  supposed to  being staying at anyways. 
 When it comes to cleaning up, I could even understand if it was all  my  mess that was needing clean up, but she treats our apartment like a dump. She eats, leaves the dishes for me to wash. Fills her trash barrels, leaves them for me to take out. Spills stuff, fucking  leaves  it there to mold and rot. If anything runs out (toilet paper, dishwasher stuff, paper towels) then it's always ever been  me  who has to pick some more up. She has put $0 into this apartment except for rent and utilities (which surprisingly she has been sending in on time.) But overall, she's a fucking SLOB and I can't take it anymore. 
 I have asked her nicely so many times to please do her part. At first she was all, ""I'm sorry, I totally will. I understand, I'm sorry."" It's now at a point where she just ignores any text I send her, doesn't pick up her phone, and isn't around in the apartment when I'm around (yet I  know  she's been here, as the trash and dishes continue to pile up mysteriously.) The whole apartment just has a huge whiff of garbage when you walk in because she has boxes and bags of crap laying in the hallway, mixed in with furniture. The last message I sent her said, ""Hi there, I was wondering if you could clean the hallway for trash? I don't know what you're throwing out and what you're keeping, so I don't want to throw anything valuable by accident."" 
 edit:  Forgot to mention that she only told me she has a part time job at a help desk at her school. She's 23, I'm 21. We're both female. 
 What should my next step be? What else can I do, if anything? Should I do anything drastic to get her attention?","Roommate is a flat out slob, everything she does is awful. Now she won't clean up her stuff and the apartment smells like garbage. What do?",21,F,relationships
"So this fuck up actually happened a few years ago,  when I was 18 but still in high school.  One night, I was hanging out with a close friend and her much older boyfriend, who had been the one to pick me up.  I never bothered to save his number because i rarely texted him, unless he was getting me to hang out with her.  I had met a cool guy and wanted my friend ""Kate"" to take a classy nude (lol) with my phone so I could send it to him.  She was super into photography and had already seen me naked multiple times so it wasn't awkward for us.  But this would be the first time I had set a nude to someone,  so I didn't want her boyfriend ""Tom"" to know. I didn't want him to think I was a slut or something. 
 We decided to set him up to watch a movie while we went to her room to ""talk"". She took the picture, and I sent it to the most recent number in my text history. I hadn't gotten around to saving the new guys' number yet.  I don't know if any of you who has ever had a Virgin Mobile phone remember this one phone that also kept a list of numbers you've recently texted without showing the actual conversation, but this was the phone that I had then. I would usually just go back to the list if I wanted send a picture,  I guess it was easier or something.  edit: it was a rumor 2 
 We go back to watching a movie with Tom. A few minutes in his phone buzzes, he glances at it and snaps it shut.  We didn't think anything of it of course.  About an hour later I still had no response from the dude.  I start to worry that maybe he didn't like it.  Kate asks me if I've heard from him at all.  When I say no,  she says ""that's weird,  it was a nice picture. Check to make sure it sent.""  I open up my text conversations with her peeking over my shoulder, only to realize that I never sent it to the new guy.  I sent it to Tom.  Just as we realize this, a Tom says ""sooo, funny story. .."" He explained that he thought this was another one of our head games that we used to play,  and refused to react to this one.  We were kinda bitches back then.",I was too lazy to save numbers in my phone so I accidentally sent a nude to my best friend's boyfriend with both of them in the same room.,18,F,tifu
"I've(27y) been seeing this guy(26y) for about two months. We've been talking and hanging out pretty much nonstop at our grad school and are now home for the holidays. We went out on a date once, but for the most part, because of study schedules, ended up hanging out more at either one of our apartments. Now that we're home, we've been texting and I've started to get the feeling that I've missed something. I wont be returning to school since I've graduated and he has to return for one more semester. We live about an hour from each other so it wouldn't be very hard to meet up. After having talked about it, we had decided to try and continue seeing each other over the holidays and see where to go from there. However, this past week after some jokes that seemed to go a bit too far, I asked him upfront if he was interested in continuing to see me and he said ""I don't know."" At this point, after two months of constant talking and hanging out, is that a clear indication for me to end things? He told me he likes hanging out and talking to me, but he's never been in a relationship before and he's not sure what answer to give me. I don't know what to do now because I had stopped talking to other guys for him. I'd tried very hard not to like him in the beginning, but I do now and I have no clue what to do.

"I'm looking for some help. My mother passed away when I was young, and my father re-married four years ago. I went to college, so I never had to live in the home with my step-family. My brother spent three years here, but then started college. Between my step-mother and her two daughters, they get into full out brawls like I've never seen before. I graduated this spring, and have to live at home a while until I can find steady enough work to sign a lease. I am 21. 
 I've been home a month now, and these people are fucking crazy. A week ago the older and younger sister, 21 and 16, got into a rolling on the ground fist fight because one put their feet on the other on the couch. They came away with bruises so bad the younger's high school teacher was concerned. The younger is typically the aggressor, but it is clear both of them are psychologically unstable. The older is diagnosed bi-polar. 
 Two nights ago we almost called the cops. The younger girl assaulted her mother, she is now bruised and was scratched so bad it broke the skin. My father is typically told to stay out of it, but it got so bad he picked her up and put her outside the room. The daughter decided the best course of action was to kick the door back open and continue it until she was thrown out of the house. 
 Now here I am. I'm an honor student, straight laced, relatively sane individual in a house full of looneys. I've found a little freelance work since graduation, but I can't move out till I hold a full time job of some sort. I don't have a car; I lived in NYC in college and my whole industry is there. My brother has become jaded to it living here and is always away or at work. When the others are home I stay in his room just to be out of their way. (I share a room with the oldest daughter even though everyone knew from the start it was a radically stupid idea.) They don't go out much, so that means I'm here alone just about always. I spend all day in his room often only coming out to eat or walk the dog. There is nothing at all in walking distance. 
 I've debated calling the cops when they fight, but I don't know what good I can do as I'm not pressing charges myself. We don't get along, but I'm certainly not stupid enough to get into a fist fight with them. If I were to tell my extended family about they're abuse and dysfunction, things at home would likely get worse for me, but I may be able to stay with someone. I also have to watch my tracks cause any time I 'act out' or give hint of an attitude my father gets the wrath of my stepmother, and I hate making things worse for him. 
 The mother realizes, at the very least, that her children need therapy and this should not be allowed to go on, but has taken no steps to do anything about it. The older has dealt with drug and alcohol problems and got herself into massive debt, the other seems a delinquent headed towards the same path. 
 I'm losing my mind here. I'm applying for jobs like there's no tomorrow. The tv does nothing for me. Every interaction I have with them when I go outside ranges from general bitchiness to trying to pick a fight with me. I have to hide any belongings important to me as they break everything in arms reach (sometimes fighting, sometimes just by being clumsy and irresponsible). Aside from being generally tucked away and lonely, I have to deal with hearing them brawl every so often. I can't take it. I can't stand the constant screaming. I'm in a long-distance relationship until we can sign a lease, and that weighs heavily on me as well.

"Edit: Thank you all the (mostly) constructive comments. This got way more attention than I expected. My husband and I are reading all of the responses. We grew up in a world telling us to follow our dreams and we can do anything we want if we work hard. But doing this at this point in our lives is simply foolish. Honestly, we had almost reached that decision but I wanted opinions from someone without an emotional attachment. And we got plenty of those. Barring (pun intended) a magical windfall, my husband is going to finish school. 
 I(29F) am hoping I can get some objective advice. My husband (29M) has an opportunity to start a retail and bar business that looks promising. It would cost us only 15k for 50% ownership of the company. The start up costs would be way more but his would-be partner's family is going to fund the rest, at around 40k. His partner is also investing 15k of his own money and wants us to simply match his amount. This has been his dream for some time. The problem is we don't have 15k and in fact are in debt from student loans at about 40k. Which all in all is not too bad except that he is currently 8 classes away from graduating with a bachelor's degree in math. He would have to drop out, and the debt we have been accruing for years would have been for nothing. This offer is in another state, so he couldn't continue school part time or even transfer because he is too close to graduation. If the business failed, and he returned to school, by then we would no longer be residents and couldn't afford tuition. 
 I support my husband financially while he is in school. I make around 60k per year. I am happy to be the provider right now, and have never resented the fact that I am in this role because my husband is a wonderful man who I know would do the same for me. My salary would cover us while he is getting the store off the ground, but likely in a paycheck to paycheck way. Plus starting a business is always risky. I can't help but feel like we would be putting our financial future in jeopardy. 
 He is devastated at this offer happening now. He knows it is not the right time. But so many people say you should follow your dreams. And this is such a good opportunity. Any other time it would cost us a lot more to get in the door. So do we take the chance at this paying off in the long run and in the mean time my husband gets to pursue something he loves instead of something he tolerates? Or do we pass, and continue on our current path?",Do we follow my husband's dream of opening a new business at a start up cost of only 15k when it means dropping out of college so close to graduation and dealing with 40k of student loan debt plus whatever debt we incur from new business?,29,F,personalfinance
"I(25F) am in a year-long lease and share a room with this roommate. We have two other roommates who are pretty cool people. All of us found each other on craigslist and have a common lease (six months in, six more to go). 
 Background: There have been red-flags right from the beginning, but none of them were exactly harmful or serious - just telling of her nature. She would constantly complain about just about everything - about how I am ""absorbing all the sunlight in the room"" (her exact words, no kidding) and she isn't getting any, about how every thing in her life is so difficult (which really is not, people would give an arm to be in the place/position she is), about how our other roommates are dirty/messy. She also has a problem with pretty much every race and ethnicity in this world. She would also constantly complain about every single person in her life. I don't like to talk much and prefer to get through my work/day quietly and mind my own business. For the most part, I would just get by with headphones or nodding and pretending to listen her complain. In general, she has a very selfish and perfectly illogical outlook toward just about anything. Like for example, her not lifting a finger to clean up the house but of course, endlessly complaining about it. My other roommates and I just chalked up her idiosyncrasies to being an only child or being treated like a princess by pretty much every one in her life. 
 Anyway, I'll cut the narrative short here for the sake of brevity. Lately, her antics have gotten worse. She makes sure she slams the door a zillion times especially when I'm asleep or working. She refuses to cooperate with anything we have to get done in the apartment. We don't converse with each other at all. Whenever I've tried, she just snaps and shouts and what not. I have been waking up with these weird rashes/bumps all over my skin and if this was a weird comedy movie we would pretty much suspect her being up to something. 
 Lately, I have been feeling very unsafe around her. I don't know if I am being super paranoid but I feel like she might harm me when I am asleep or something. Just the sight of her face triggers my anxiety so badly that I have to stop whatever I am doing and take deep breaths. I have forgotten the last time I slept peacefully for at least just a few hours. Oh and I'm pretty sure she's been making up stories behind my back (because pretty much every mutual friend just ignores me now). I've tried thinking over my own actions and behaviour critically to see if any of this was my doing or if there was anything I could/can do to stop all this weirdness. Honestly, I don't think I've done anything to warrant all her craziness and hatred toward me. I've lived with over 10 different roommates over the past many many years (in different parts of the world!) and this is the single most problematic/selfish person I've ever met. 
 I guess what I am trying to ask is, how do I get through another six months (till the lease expires) living with her? I am struggling to keep my mental health intact with all this happening. Has anyone lived with difficult roommates before? How did you deal with it? For financial reasons, I cannot break the lease or move out temporarily. If this ever escalates to anything physical what should I do?","Looking for advice on dealing with my difficult roommate. Any precautions I can take, in case things get worse?",25,F,relationships
"You are so lucky. I was one of the ones with the perfect childhood and life for the most part until just over a year ago when everything fell apart. I was 18 then, 19 now and my parents had been married for 22 years. They got married when my mom was 16 and dad was 24 but it seemed like they had been madly in love for all those years. Then, in February of last year, my mom just left and my 20 year old sister and 12 year old brother and I didn't see or hear from her for about two months and then we found out some crazy stuff about how she went and slept with a bunch of guys and that she wanted an open marriage and such. My parents announced that they were getting divorced and then mom suddenly had a boyfriend who is 52 even though my mom is only 39 and then my dad suddenly had this really annoying high voiced girlfriend and then my dad decided that we had to move away from the house that we had lived in forever and we moved to some shitty house and his girlfriend moved in with us. My mom was finally back in contact with my siblings and I and we were informed she had moved in with her boyfriend on his houseboat on the river. After a few months of living with my dad, my sister and I had been fighting with him a lot and getting along great with our mom and she decided to get a house where we could both have bedrooms so we moved in with her and I ended up not talking to my dad for a few months. Eventually, I patched things up with my dad but then my mom started acting like a fucking psycho bitch and was yelling all the time and then sometimes would seem like she was in a daze. My sister and I found out my mom had been taking a bunch of prescription pills and smoking a lot of weed and that's why she was acting so crazy although I think it was more the pills than weed. On Father's Day last year, it was the day after my sister and I had moved into the new house with our mom and her boyfriend and just a few days after my high school graduation and we got the call that my grandpa (on mom's side) had had a stroke and was unconscious in the hospital and may not make it much longer. My mom, my sister and I all immediately bought plane tickets to California to see my grandpa and he died a week later. It was devastating. My grandpa was one of my favorite people in my life. When we flew home, my dad decided that the death of her father was the appropriate time to return my mom's dog to her since he didn't want to take care of her. My dad said the wrong thing concerning my grandpa and my mom flipped out and headbutted my dad and the police were called and it was a huge mess. The next day, my dad told me that while I was in another state watching my grandpa die, he had decided that one of our dogs (a blue Great Dane) was too big for our new house and so he gave her away without telling me or letting me say goodbye. Now my parents are in a custody battle over my brother and my mom want child support even though my dad is a completely fit parent and would be awarded split custody. I think my mom has stopped taking the pills and that she stopped drinking along with her boyfriend because it made her and her boyfriend fight. Until I can get enough money to move out, I'm being shifted from house to house each week along with my brother. I have been smoking a lot of weed and I've been on Prozac nearly a year now since I was cripplingly depressed there for a while. Smoking weed makes me feel closer to my grandpa since he was a huge stoner. It'll be June 24th again soon and it's really hard to think it's been a whole year without him. I miss him so much. I miss my dog so much. I miss my grandpa more though obviously. I am trying to make some changes to my life though. I'm tired of being a loser. I have an appointment to talk to a financial aid adviser at a college and I've been eating healthier and keeping track of what I eat with myfitnesspal.com and the myfitnesspal app and once I start exercising more, I will lose even more weight.

"sidenote: I'm using a throwaway account for this, a few friends and family know my Reddit username, and this would  really  make things awkward between us if they read this story. It's a little too personal for the eyes of people I know irl. 
 At the age of 14~15 I discovered that I am a homosexual. At the same time, however, I was a devout Christian. I knew what the bible said about gays. The fact that I felt attraction to other boys, and had had oral sex with one before, made me feel guilty. It made me feel dirty and sinful, I felt horrible. I was ashamed of myself. I hated the fact that I was aroused by mens’ bodies, and a woman’s curves were nothing special. After months of depression stemmed from self-loathing and shame, one night I was on my computer and, out of simple curiosity, I searched up some youtube videos on evolution. 
 I had always been a very curious and fair-minded kind of kid. So, after years of hearing lopsided, biased views against evolution, calling it “lies made up by the devil”, I wanted to hear what they, actual scientists, who have studied it for their whole scientific careers had to say about Evolution, and it made perfect sense to me. I stayed up until ~2am that night learning about natural selection, artificial selection, and all the beauty of the Theory of Evolution. And I remember the words I said in front of my computer screen like it was yesterday, “I am now an atheist.” 
 That night, I cried myself to sleep. Not tears of sadness, but happiness and relief. It had been the greatest feeling ever, having the relief of not fearing eternal punishment in a made-up hell just for loving men. Thank god for atheism.","Found out I was gay very young, this made me depressed because I felt like I had betrayed my religion, one night I learned about evolution online and decided to be an atheist, being an atheist brought me out of depression, made me a much more happy person and led to self acceptance.",14,M,atheism
"I am currently attending Penn State University as a freshman. I made into University Park, so I'm really happy and excited to be in such a wonderful academic setting. I have always been outgoing and I can handle my alcohol much better than my friends seem to be able to... I'm usually the one who is playing babysitter at the end of the night, even though I have had the same. This sounds like bragging, but it's apart of the back story. Everyone knows that Penn State is a big party school, and I found out that I am actually able to thrive in this environment. This brings so much confidence that I am able to choose girls during the night. I was raised by an elementary teacher single mother who taught me that I need to be a gentleman to succeed in life, so I have not done anything more than second base with a girl since I've gotten here. I'm currently talking to a girl who is very attractive and seems to be interested in me; we drunkenly made out at a party, and then hung out a few times. I really like this girl, but it's been about a week and a half and already I'm getting nervous that I am growing too fond of her. The last real relationship that I had ended horribly: she left me for a guy who's dad had just died the last week of school, nothing like watching him rub her back during graduation, hold her hand during pool day, and dance with her at Senior Banquet (Prom). I couldn't even be mad at him, though, because of the whole dad thing. I had been with her for two years, on and off, because she didn't trust me and I had been hurt even before then. (This is where it gets ridiculous because I understand that kids this young can't get their hearts broken, but it still adds to the substance.) In eighth grade, almost the exact same thing happened to me. I liked a girl, I was going through puberty, I was diagnosed with depression, and she left me and took all of my friends.

"I seriously feel like I am in high school all over again. I had a good amount of amazing friends a year ago. Moved to a new city an hour away, most of the close friends I had no longer talk to me or each other. All the friends I have made in this new area are my boyfriends friends. I am 26 years old and I spend my days playing League of Legends and watching anime. I don't like to go to the mall, or spend a bunch of money on useless crap I don't need. 
 I am trying to find my own group of friends, but have nothing in common with anyone I meet outside my boyfriends group. I just want to find my own group of people to hang out with. I know it's not easy, but I just don't have much in common with other girls. If I do, their personalities seem to clash with mine, or the one friend I do have that is a girl is so involved with her boyfriend I hardly see her, and we live together. 
 I just seriously want my own life, my own people to hang out with. I know I'm a fun person to be around. I have never had problems making friends in the past. Then again, all the people in my life up until 6 months ago were people I met at raves. Since I no longer go to raves it seems harder to meet people.

"I had a shitty time in school.  I was chunky, and a bit of a social outcast.  Computers were my life, and my grades and persona hygiene suffered for it.  While I liked girls, I basically assumed that was a whole area of life that simply ""wasn't meant for me"".  And as far as I was concerned, I had  no right  to even desire dating, or anything more serious.  It was off-limits. 
 This self-loathing would last for a good 15 years or so.  Now I'm an IT guy in CA, staring down the barrel of middle-age, lonely, and taking care of my mother.  It felt like I'd be doing this for the rest of my life. 
 That scared the shit out of me. 
 As as result, the past couple years I've made major changes to my diet and my physical appearance.  While I still look chunky, I'm finally losing fat and replacing it with muscle, giving me the strength, (slightly better) confidence, and stamina to enjoy activities that once left me winded or ashamed to be involved in.  I'm starting to ditch the oh-so-hilarious retro/novelty t-shirts, and trading them in for some actual buttoned shirts (at least at work). 
 I'm actually feeling pretty good right now. 
 So much so that in the last 6 months or so I created an account on a popular free dating website.  I'm a smart, geeky guy, with a dark and strange sense of humor at times.  I was never seriously expecting to find a match on the website; someone equally quirky and appreciative of intelligent humor.  (Read: someone who'd put up with my goofy shit and stack their own shit on top of  that .) 
 Surprisingly, someone actually messaged me on the site, saying that she thought we'd make a good pair. 
 I was floored.  She ended up being gorgeous, and everything I'd hoped, and most surprising of all, didn't trigger my scam-o-meter.  We talked for a couple months online, texted, and then eventually agreed to meet on a short date at a local coffee shop. 
 My stomach was in knots at first, but it was a fantastic evening!  She was everything I'd expected, and more.  I found myself a bit more quiet than I usually would be, mostly I guess because I was afraid I'd fuck it up.  But she seemed to be having fun with me, as I was with her.  I noticed her twirling her hair, and accidentally brushing against my hand at times - thought I'd read someplace these were positive signs. 
 We parted long after the shop had closed up, talking late into the evening.  The desire on her part, and mine, to go on a second date was unmistakable. 
 I emailed her when I got home, making sure she got back okay, and thanking her for the evening, putting down in text my interest in continuing forward. 
 We've interacted a lot online, and via SMS the past week or so since the date, discussing ideas of where to go next. 
 So it's a lock for another date.  Apparently, despite my self-loathing, despite still being a chunky fuck, she seems to dig me.  You have no idea how stunned I am by this.  You see, that wasn't just my first date with her, that was my first date  ever .  I've never had any sort of romantic intimacy with a woman, of any kind.  It's just never happened.  I basically excluded myself from the chance of it ever happening, at an early age.  Imagine my surprise when I finally put myself out there, and I strike gold almost immediately.  Unreal. 
 I seriously don't want to fuck this up.  There are, however, extremely embarrassing 'gaps in my resume', so to speak, that are incredibly awkward to explain at my age: how inexperienced I am at dating, that I've never had the opportunity to kiss or have sex with anyone, and that I basically share a rent with my mother who's medically and financially dependent on me. 
 Just thinking about all this is a dozen times more stressful than that first date was.  I'm not a bad guy, I'm just trying to turn my life around and enjoy it while I'm still relatively young.  She comes off as someone who wouldn't make a big deal out of all of this, but I'm still greatly embarrassed by it. 
 If I don't say anything, though, I'm fairly sure she'll notice.  I'm an honest guy, too.  I'd rather have her understand what's up with me, up front, and maybe lead the dance until I'm comfortable, so to speak.  And if she's somehow uncomfortable with continuing after finding this out... I have only myself, and my choices in life, to blame for that.

"19 year old male] Hey everyone, I figure this is as good a place as any to vent anonymously.So I recently have decided to accept my bisexuality, I have been suppressing it for a while and am still in the closet to all of my family and friends. Here is the thing though... I was not suppressing my sexuality because I hate LGBT people or anything. I grew up in a very LGBT friendly family, especially considering my uncle was gay. I think my rejection of my sexuality the fact that I am the last male member of my family (at least in the US) so I feel a strong urge to continue my bloodline. That may sound really stupid or immature, and it probably is, but it is just something that I consider really important. 
 Coming Out?: So here is the thing, I really think I like women more on an emotional level, and I am fairly sure that I would only marry a woman (I can't be certain, and no I do not have anything against gay marriage). So my main question is: Should I come out? I will probably tell one of my best friends when she gets back from school next week, but beyond her I don't know. Also, and advice on how to talk to counselors/ therapists with this issue. 
 So I guess I was just wondering what you guys thought about my situation.",Should I come out as Bi if I only plan on having relationships with women?,19,M,bisexual
"so, i'm a 24 year old filipina nurse doing nursey stuff in the kingdom of saudi arabia. however, because i am extremely paranoid i chose my location to be dubai instead of k.s.a, thinking the men there won't be as (for the lack of better word) ""intense"". 
 i am several thousand miles away from home and on my fifth month here but it feels like it's been forever. needless to say, it can get very lonely. i thought okc would be able to help me with that but every single day it fails me. i click on the envelope icon, close my eyes, cross my fingers and hope for the best... i open my eyes and sigh because i'm looking yet again at a list of men mostly indians and middle easterns with messages that start and end with ""hi!""

"I'm young, 18, and my girlfriend and I just broke up today. 
 We were both new to relationships and all, so some of it was a little awkward but mostly exciting. We started going out in May, and just celebrated our 3 month a couple of days ago. I know it sounds stupid to be with someone for 3 months and say that you love them, but I did. And she did too. She told me though, that since it's getting serious, she'd rather cut it off now than do a long distance relationship (she's moving 10hrs away for college), which I totally understand. 
 In my head, I can make the LDR work but in reality I know it can't. She won't be coming back to visit for the breaks because of her parents, I can't really visit often because of school and work, and after her 4 years she's going into the navy, to then go on to med school. 
 We ""broke up"" a month ago over the same reasons, but got back together when we realized how much we missed each other. It was just 2 days ago we said that we loved each other. I don't feel upset like I did the first time when I think about her, I just feel like a piece of my heart is being hardened so I won't forget her, and it gives a little warmth, but sadness too... 
 I told her we should talk again about getting together after she's done with the Navy, but I know it's not realistic to hold onto that as a whisp of hope. 
 It started off as a summer fling and now that we realize it's serious, we need to end it, I feel like I'm part of a romance movie and someone hit ""stop"" right in the middle of it, right as the 2 characters are supposed to turn around and realize that they love eachother and they go off and live happily ever after. Sounds stupid but that's how it feels.
I don't know what I'm really looking for by posting this, I guess just a validation that everything is going to be ok, or similar stories about how it got better...

"First year in college. Virgin - never been kissed, been on one date with a guy I'll call ""X"". X and I had talked and flirted, realizing that we had a lot in common (despite a small age difference, him being older than me). We went on a very platonic date, and still keep in contact. I've been out of town, so I haven't seen him very much. 
 Well...soon after we started to get to know each other, I would get really turned on when we would talk. Like ""maybe I should wear a panty liner"" turned on. 
 My body just seems to really want sex. I've gotten my first vibrator (hooray for discreet packaging!) and am tentatively trying it out. All I can say is, whoah! But I still feel super-duper horny. Since X and I aren't in a ""relationship"" I still make eyes at hot guys I see, and have what one might call ""lustful thoughts."" X hasn't brought up sex or even tried to put on the moves, if you will. 
 And to make things even more awkward, I'm in the slow recovery from an eating disorder that stole friends, happiness, and health from me. I'm on birth control right now so I could have a regular period, for the first time in 3 years. I'm worried how my body looks. I'm not as skinny as I used to be, but I'm not fat (as part of the recovery I'm avoiding the scale; probably around 145, 5' 6"" right now, got a bit of a booty). 
   I have no experience in making the moves and feel myself trying to pull away from trying, just like obsessing over how my body looked pulled me away from friends in high school. 
 I'm not looking for a long-term relationship, rather, something more casual, an environment where I can feel comfortable ""practicing."" I would love to have that with X, but I don't know how to ask. Also, I changed my appearance a bit since I last saw him (new haircut, gained about 5 lbs since I went on birth control).","Horny virgin wants to fuck, held back by the ghosts of her eating-disorder, body-dysmorphic past.

"My boyfriend's last relationship went really sour and he and his ex don't talk. When I asked him why, he said she's just a horrible person who used him and threw him out (I used to be really intimidated by her because I thought she was prettier, so I wanted to believe this). I don't know her, but I want her side of the story. 
 I'd like to get the story from him, but I haven't been able to. I want to ask him more, so I understand his relationship style and why he's so worried about being vulnerable with me, but I don't want to make him upset (I'd like for him to be able to discuss it maturely, but, well... one reason I'm ambivalent about the relationship is I don't know how maturely he handles tough topics in conversation, or a has a willingness to confront things). 
 He's MENSA brilliant, totally a feminist, athletic, sweet... but I think his last relationship just shut him down and he says he actively doesn't like to connect with people. Even though I'm ""amazing and prettier than her and a better person than her,"" and we've been together for a year, he STILL won't be vulnerable with me emotionally. 
 So I want to know, from her, why they broke up, so I can understand where he's coming from when he won't tell me himself. I just worry about him figuring out how I know things. 
 BTW we're early twenties. 
 What do I do? If I shouldn't confront her, 100%, then what should I do instead? How do I encourage him to tell me more about a relationship he doesn't like talking about? I know each relationship is separate, but his last one left such an impression on him that it's hurting his current one. 
 Also, by 'vulnerable,' I mean, he says that ""girls don't like guys with weaknesses"" so he doesn't tell me when he's sad or afraid or worried. I think not being open with your feelings, because you think people won't except you, is weak, TBH. He doesn't worry much, but, I want to be there for him when he does. I want a whole human being. It's hard for me to trust him when he can't trust me with his emotions, because he thinks I'll ditch him as soon as his 'superman' mask breaks down.","Boyfriend's emotionally guarded, says it has to do with ex, won't tell me why- am I a dumbass to want to ask her what happened?",20,F,relationship_advice
"I'm 23, 5'7"" and about a buck twenty.  I haven't really changed weight  since high school, lost some muscle and gained a little fat to even out to the same weight.  I fucking HATE IT when people tell me to ""eat a cheeseburger"" as many of the comments here have pointed out. 
 Being small mean I get cold easy, get tired easy, I have no appetite and no stamina.  I think a lot of this has to do with my depression (which, thanks, really gets helped out by your comments on my body), but I can't blame it on that because I was even a skinny BABY.  You know how babies have cute little fat on their cheeks?  I never had that. 
 In second grade I was in the 90th percentile for height and the 10th percentile for weight.  My middle school counselors called my Mom into school because they thought I was legitimately anorexic (she just basically went off on them because they didn't even check to see if I was eating at lunch... they were retarded.)  When I started sports in high school, you know those mean replacement shakes?  Like Ensure?  I had to have one WITH breakfast on doctor's orders, or else I wouldn't be taking in enough calories to be on the cross country team. 
 I have tiny hips that are exacerbated by the fact that a small portion of my right hip bone was removed in surgery when I was 10 (unrelated to my skinniness).  I guess I have nice sized boobs, of course I'd like bigger but my skinny little collar bones make bra fitting a nightmare.  Not to mention pants... hardly anywhere sold double zero sized pants, which I had to wear for years.  Thankfully now I'm a ""normal"" 3. 
 You know what?  I'm not even that skinny.  I'm not 90lbs... I'm 120.  My BMI is in the ""underweight"" score, yes, but not by much.  And I think it's ok.  All this complaining aside, most days I am ok with my body type.  I've had years of nasty comments to build up some thick skin.  It's still irritating to hear things like this, though.  I think I'm somewhat pretty, have healthy hair, my acne is clearing up... I'm good. 
 What I'd really like is to put on some muscle but it's SO HARD for me.  I don't eat enough and I try to force myself, but depression takes the joy out of food.  I guess I should clarify that... I eat enough to live and maintain the same weight.

"My wife and I purchased a house in 2013 in a very nice town about 20 mins south of Boston.
I was making 95k/yr and my wife 15.8k/yr part time. Our home was $320k and we saved up a down payment of $70k. 
 Our fixed rate is 4.025% and our current mortgage is 1700/month. Our other bills totaling 900/month not including food. We have two little girls. 
 Well, I lost my job and so did my wife, around the same time about 1 year ago. It. Was. Hard. To say the least. Somehow, thru savings and investments, we managed to keep our house despite missing a few payments and are still currently close to 20-25 days behind each month on our mortgage. We've also cut our monthly expenses down to 625/month. 
 I'm currently working 2 jobs, 70 hours a week making 47k/year and my wife is making 12k/yr. We are extremely poor and have no real money left each month and its very hard to rebuild our emergency fund. My full time job is promising, guaranteed raises for 5 years until I'll be making 108k/yr but that's a long ways away. 
 Our house has gained some value, prob around 350-360k now and we currently owe 253k. So, that's a good thing, but our credit has tanked from missed cc and car payments to below 600. Impossible to get another home loan. We think about selling but don't want to give up on our dream and have a great spot for our kids. We're surviving.

"I'm 35 years old, and I've been with my 39 year old fiance for over seven years, while her kids [11 F / 13 M / 18 M] have been living with us for over six years. 
 In this time, I've been able to develop a good relationship with them, even with their biological father being still in the picture. 
 However, the relationship between all of them has become more and more strained. My daughter, who is going through her prepubescent years, has been going through her mood swings, which has created increased tension with her brothers. And the eldest is constantly arguing with his mother, to the point where she is now in tears almost every night because of the stuff he says to her. 
 My fiance has become more and more distant with the family over the years as well. She is home less and, even when she is home, she is either on her phone or the computer, not interacting with the rest of the family. This is in fact the main source of tension between her and the eldest­. 
 I'm personally at my wit's end about it all. I've contemplated ending it all, but I don't want to put the family through another reason for drama. When the kids entered my life, I made a personal commitment that I wouldn't just up and leave during difficult times. 
 But I feel like the situation at home is affecting my own mental well being. I get more and more anxiety attacks, and have taken more frequently to trying to isolate myself, thus making me feel like I'm making the problems worse. 
 I care for them all and I just wish that they would learn to get along instead of trying to gain the upper hand in arguments. 
 Part of me feels like things will lessen once the eldest decides to move out and become his own person, but I also don't want to kick him out, as he's wholly unprepared to move away, what with him not having a job and all. 
 I just need to find a way to better cope with all of this to avoid going mad myself.",The increased drama and arguments between my step-kids and their mother is making me miserable. I need advice to help cope with it all.,35,M,relationships
"I (24F) have been with my SO (26M) for almost 3 years. We are both very serious about our relationship. We get along so well and we never stop laughing and having fun and we talk about our future lives together, getting married, having kids, etc. We rarely argue but we bicker about little things as normal couples do. Sex life has had its ups and downs but we talk through it and communicate well in order to fix things when needed and now we have an excellent sex life. He had always been very generous in the bedroom. This is what I imagine a perfect relationship to be and he makes me feel so good. He constantly compliments me, treats me like gold, and he's incredibly patient which is something I admire so much about him. I learn so much from him. Plus, he is so attractive and sexy and extremely smart and I could go on for days. I am just absolutely in love with him. 
 Only thing that worries me is the fact that he is a slow mover when it comes to taking the next step in our relationship. I am in no big rush to get married and have kids right now but at some point, I want our relationship to progress and I will indeed want all of that by the time I get to my late 20's. It took him over a year to say he loved me (even though I knew he did long before he actually said it). I was patient because I knew I wasn't going anywhere and neither was he and we just love spending time together. But now, at this point in our relationship, I want to move in together but he claims he isn't ready. He admitted it was for selfish reasons (he just enjoys having his own space) so I will admit I was hurt by this and pretty frustrated because of where I am at in my life. 
 I graduated college May of 2014 and immediately got a job out of college. I have my dream career that I love and hope to have for a long time. I am a teacher so I don't make great money therefore I cannot afford to live on own paying rent on top of my current bills. I've been living with a family member rent free and soon will be paying a very small amount for rent monthly. I could find a roommate and pay more for rent than what I would be with my family member but I thought it made more sense to find a place to live with my SO and share a home. In my opinion, this would be a perfect time for him to move as well but, once again, he isn't ready to live with me. 
 He kind of doesn't have a career plan at all. He has a college degree but has a job that doesn't pay well. He doesn't really enjoy it either so we aren't sure where he's going from here. 
 Also, when we do talk about getting married, he says he won't be ready for that for a looooong time which I can imagine considering how slow he has moved in other parts of our relationship. Marriage isn't important to him because his parents have a bit of a weird relationship. Like I said before, I'm not ready to get married right now (even though I fantasize about it), I am just scared that he will drag his feet and hold off on everything as long as possible. I know I'm still young but I am just so ready to keep our relationship progressing as we grow together.","Amazing relationship between my bf and I but he's not ready to take the next step.

"I'm a 20 year old female who has started to realized that I'll be Foreveralone. I have bad acne, I'm overweight, I have repulsive facial feature (small brown eyes, a short upturned nose, and tiny lips that people say look like a Cupid's bow), and curly brown hair. I also have tan skin with a rosy undertone. I've been ugly since I was 10, and I'm now coming to terms with the fact that I'll never be the tall, pale, straight hair woman with beautiful facial features (big blue or green eyes, a straight, average length nose, and full lips) that most men desire. I'm not on track to having a high power career that modern men desire in a woman. I'll probably end up working as an office clerk or receptionist and only bring in about 35k tops. Even unattractive men with no accomplishments and/or no career don't want to date me. 
 I'm very shy, soft-spoken, and reserved. I have no friends. In fact, I don't think I've ever had friends. Most of the kids who called me a friend ran away from me once they found out I had a twin sister who is way cooler than me. In fact, she's in college, has a job, and is planning on renting a house or apartment with a few friends, while I'm still living with my parents and have only completed 13 college credits in 2 years at a crap community college. 
 I also have no idea what I want to do. Nothing interest me. My parents have implied that my interest are stupid and worthless and want me to do engineering, accounting, computer science, or something in the medical field. I like art, classical music, foreign languages, and other things that are considered ""cultured"", but I grew up in a rural town and people automatically perceive me as ""redneck"" even though I'm not. Therefore, people in these circles want nothing to do with me.

I love feminine, pretty clothing, but at 5'5"" and 180 pounds, I'm too short and fat to wear it. I just wear jeans, t-shirts, hoodies, and sneakers since I'm too embarrassed about what I did too my body. I also love earrings, but I have a metal allergy so I can't wear them. I never feel pretty, feminine, or girly enough, and that is all I want to be. 
 I have never dated, kissed, or had sex. I was not allowed to date in high school and I'm still not. I have no experience and I feel like I'm behind my peers socially. My views on dating are described as old fashioned. I would never date online, and I would never have sex with a man after only a few dates. I thought men would not care about the fact that I'm a virgin, but they do. They hate it. 
 My dream was to date a nice, strong man, fall in love with him, lose my virginity to him after several months of dating, become engaged, get married, and then have a baby. I always wanted to be an ultra feminine housewife who took care of her husband. I now realize this is a fantasy and will never happen. I'm now starting to think that this is a stupid idea anyways, and I should look for a job instead.

I was in shock and didn't do anything about it. I didn't struggle. And after about 3 hours he was done, he stood up and said, ""I guess you secretly wanted it, you didn't even fight back""

 I am currently about 245 down from 270 last year.  I'd like to get to 200...  We started Paleo and thus far I feel great.  So food wise, I feel pretty solid.  Now it's on the workouts.  I'm also getting into mud runs as it gives me a sense of ""training"" for something rather than just working out. 
 So what I really need is a good routine/schedule I can do utilizing the park and running that can be done in about 40 min without any (or very little) extra equipment.  The park is about 1/4 mile around to run. 
 I did do this workout yesterday:
Run 1/2 mile
50 standing squats
run 1/2 mile
40 burpees
run 1/2 mile
30 sit-ups
run 1/2 mile
20 push-ups 
 Felt great, but I want more variety and to make sure I don't workout for nothing.",I only have lunchtime to work out and have a park and room to run available to me.  Please help.,30,M,Fitness
"I'm about 14 (don't remember my exact age, although I could reverse engineer it). I have never kissed a girl, never really had a girlfriend. I'm a gawky and introverted nerd living in a little town. Don't have many friends, and not all that crazy about most of the few I do have. I'm the smartest kid in my class, but scrawny and unathletic. In the span of a few years I have somehow gone from being one of the cool kids in my grade to being one of the people who are mostly ignored by the cool kids. I feel alone and isolated most of the time. 
 My older brother gets married, and they have a major wedding reception at her parents' house in a town about 10 miles away from my hometown. Two bars, no one cares if kids are drinking. This house is an old mansion in a hick town in the midwest, has about 20 rooms. I've had some drinks and am feeling good, when someone tells me that one of the bridesmaids has a little sister my age who thinks I'm cute.
I eventually find her (it's a huge party) and we chat for a bit and hit it off. She's cute and seems bright and funny and nice. I have visions of having a real girlfriend for the first time. I feel like this could be a turning point in my life...I've met a cool girl, and she actually seems to like me. Between the alcohol buzz and the unexpected situation, I feel like a little kid who has come downstairs on Christmas morning and found everything he wants under the tree, plus a bunch of other great stuff he didn't even know existed. 
 We roam off, holding hands, and find an empty room. We sit on a little couch and talk some more. Finally, I work up my nerve and I kiss a girl for the first time in my life. And she pukes and runs out of the room.","Alcohol bringeth, and alcohol taketh away.",14,M,AskReddit
"So I've only been on one date with this girl I met on Okc and at the beginning we got the ""yes I'm seeing other people,"" out of the way.  It went really well and we've texted and talked a lot in the past week (probably too much IMO, but I enjoy it to much not to return her messages).  And she initiates most of the conversations (although I do enjoy them). 
 We're going out Saturday night, however she ""had"" me call her tonight (I wanted to) and we talked for a couple hours until she said that her date was there and she had to run.  I've seen other people this week and I'm not the type to get jealous, but it seems a bit too upfront to tell me she's heading out with another guy.  I mean things are going well enough to see the person again and saying you're on your way out with someone else just puts pictures in my head that I don't want.

"I'm in a really bad place right now.  I've been fighting an extremely powerful depression for about a year now. 
 My little foster brother died at age 11 in March 2014.  He was an innocent boy, played baseball for the local team, went to church, loved singing in the church musicals, and was super excited to be in band when he got old enough so he could be like me.  Then my stepfather died in September 2014 of lung cancer.  He was a very good man, took in my mom and us 3 boys after our father lost his mind to drugs and alcohol.  He wasn't very emotionally supportive but he helped us in ways I'm just now realizing.  He taught us how to fix basic issues with our car like oil/tire changes, fluid checks, etc.  He taught me how to set up a PC and how to make sure it's protected from viruses.  He taught us how to cook.  He was a great man that left behind two ex wives (one being my mom), two bio-daughters, and three stepsons. 
 I was doing okay after my foster brother died.  Then my stepdad died and I just fucking crashed.  I've been low since September and I can't get out of it.  I utterly failed a semester of college which put my graduation back a whole year, if it ever happens.  Nobody trusts me now, especially my professors.  I'm failing this semester too.  I'm just too fucking depressed to even get out of bed.  I don't even know why I would bother to go to college.  I'm a fucking bagboy at a grocery store at almost 23 years old, asking paper or plastic and pushing carts for minimum wage, and I can't even do that right.  There's no fucking way I can complete my major and be a teacher.  My mentor/good friend/ex-teacher wants me to graduate fast so I can work with her at my alma mater and take over for her when she leaves.  I don't know how to tell her she's placing her trust in a fucktard.  I'm dumb as a box of rocks.  I'm a drunk.  I'm an addict.  I'm unreliable.  I'm angry.  There's no way anybody will hire me with my college record.  I'm absolutely fucked on getting a real teaching job, if I ever graduate.  I'll probably just end up being a fucking bagboy for the rest of my life. 
 It doesn't help that all my friends are student teaching, getting ready to graduate, and auditioning for grad school.  And here I am, fucking five years into my degree already and a year behind.  Everybody I know will be graduating this semester and I'm stuck for another fucking year.  I quit my fraternity too, so I'll basically have no friends after May.  I'm gonna be stuck in a year of fucking loneliness.  I don't know why I should bother continuing school or why I should even bother living. 
 And my suicidal thoughts bring about a whole other level of guilt.  I can't fucking kill myself.  I have two brothers that I live with that depend on me emotionally, financially, and socially.  I have a fiancee that loves me and would be lost without me.  My mentor depends on me to take over her job when she moves on to bigger and better things.  My best friend is emotionally unstable and she depends on me to be her rock, and I love her more than words could ever say.  I'd be lost without that woman.  My mom needs me as the eldest child and the one that mediates between her and the younger boys.  So many people need me, but all I want to do is kill myself.  Why am I so fucking broken.  I'm so fucking shitty.",I'm a piece of shit,23,M,SuicideWatch
"Like most stories I see on here, this happened awhile back. 
 I had smoked weed approximately a dozen times in my lifetime. I was a senior in college and had recently made my first purchase of my own weed (I'd thrown in a $20 at a party on several occasions). I decided that I wanted to make a weed cookie. I had taken many chemistry classes, so I thought ""I'm a pretty smart guy, I can just wing it, what's the worst that can happen?? Nobody has ever OD'd on weed before!"" 
 I proceeded to put some butter and some weed into a pan and heat them up. I don't remember how much butter I used, but in hindsight, I put waaaay too much weed in. I heated them up for awhile (I knew the chemistry behind what was going on, so I sort of knew what I was doing). 
 Normally, there is a process after heating that is done.. I didn't do that and just left the leafy green stuff in there. I figured ""Hell, I'll just power through it"".. once again thinking ""what's the worst that could happen?"" 
 I mixed the butter with some flour, sugar, an egg, brown sugar, a pinch of salt and a pinch of baking soda. Didn't use a recipe, didn't care. I popped the dough into the oven as i took a hit from the pipe I had. I was a little high, and anticipating the cookie. 
 8-10 minutes later, I popped the cookie out and let it cool. I broke off a chunk and ate it. Not bad. The taste was bearable, even with the leafy greens still in it. I ate the entire cookie and took another hit. I sat on the sofa and was watching tv. I sent a couple of texts to friends asking them about edibles... 
 The general consensus was ""Hold on, you're in for a wild ride."" I stepped outside for a minute and the transition hit me like a train. I had no idea how long ago I ate the cookie, but I was definitely feeling something different. 
 Standing outside of my apartment, apartment door still open behind me, no idea why I came outside. I was aware of every single moving thing around me.. the birds, passing cars, each individual leaf fluttering in the hot summer breeze.. I could see it all with my ears.. except for the next door neighbors who were just getting home. 
 ""Hello Igor!"" the friendly Southeast asian neighbor said. He never got my name right. My hand was on my forehead and I lowered it as a kind of salute (????) ""good evening"" I replied. Evening? who the fuck says that? It's 3:30 in the afternoon?.. oh well. He didn't seem to notice. 
 Apartment door was still open. I turned around and closed it. I reached into my pocket. Keys. Locked the door and walked down to my car. I'll go to that super huge store that everyone hates but still shops at anyway. I was in no shape to drive, I do not advise driving while under the influence of anything. I should not have gotten into my car, but I did. 
 I drove the 6 miles to the ""megalomart"". I had my sunglasses on (thank GOD) when I got out of the car. As I was walking in, I saw one of my superiors from work walking out. I didn't know him well, he was above me. He would recognize me. He could fire me. I looked at him and we both made the same friendly ""nod wave"" gesture to each other. NAILED IT. Awesome. Walked into the store. Another transition. 
 The cool air conditioning felt wonderful. I was floating. I felt like I was walking on marshmallows and that I would bounce like Neil Armstrong if I really wanted to. Then it hit me. This place is huge.... I looked at my phone. 3 new text messages... Dad... mom.... Smoker friend: ""Pretty sure your high is going to last awhile. Be careful"" 
 I started to panic, but then decided to look at fishing lures for a minute to calm myself down. I loved fishing and ESPECIALLY fishing lures as a kid, and still love fishing/lures. I did, but was still overwhelmed with the size of the store. I was also overwhelmed with... the need for food. and the need to urinate. and I feel like I haven't had anything to drink for years. I went to the bathroom and drank about a liter of water at the water fountain. Then I bailed. 
 Got out of that hell hole and went to get a burger. Ordered and ate one burger on the way home. Stopped for another burger from a different chain. Ate that one when I got to my apartment. It was getting dark.. 8pm... what happened to all of that time? No idea whatsoever. 
 I watched a few movies, still high as a kite, and fell asleep.... 
 The next morning, my alarm went off. Still high. I had to be at work. In a pharmacy..in a megalomart (but not the one I went to the day before).... and I was still high. 
 The workday was relatively uneventful, thank GOD. It was Monday, which is hell day in pharmacy, but I was good at my job and (apparently) even better at it while high. I was extremely paranoid, and I found a bit of weed on my sock at one point, but overall, I was OK. 
 I was texting my friends during the day, and they were all shocked that I was still high. It took me 32 hours to come down completely from the high.","I didn't do my research and inadvertently discovered Marijuana XR

"First of all, after reading through some top posts, I would like to wish strength to everyone who has been in a similar situation. There is no simple way to get over the years of abuse, double standards, lack of self image(my case anyway), the blame game, but it's a work in progress. 
 I would also like to vent out my story.I'm a 26 year old Indian guy living with his parents. My father is a text book definition of a narc, with severe anger issues all his life, he has always been right in everything, also he knows everything about everything. From how to make a needle to rocket science, to astrophysics, everything !! 
 I'll share a few things, which has many a times made me contemplate about how broken a human being I am, and that I won't be able to experience happiness the way other people can. 
 I have always been beaten all my life, for the most trivial of things, I have never been a trouble making child, been a really good student, top 10 until the master's level. Everyone except my family respects me for being humble and a well mannered guy. I can't even put a foot right in my life according to my father,he controls everything in my life from my haircut to what do I eat and when I wake up. Hell, I can't even keep a light on in my room without his permission. Just today, I kept a light on as I was working on something in my room, he comes into my room and switches it off, I switch it back on again, he doesn't like me undermining him. So he goes away from my room,angered. Now, 5 minutes later, I have to ask for something from him, he starts to talk to me as if I just committed a horrible crime, when I ask him as to why is he talking to me like that, he says that why did I switch the light on?? I was shocked, this man is in his 60's, he's not a kid. 
 This triggers anger in me, and I storm off to my room just wanting to break my head against the wall, and I hear my mum saying these exact words to him "" Why do you help him when you know he is mad? Why do you spoil your mouth when you know he is not worth it"". A few minutes later I'm in my room lying down on my bed, father comes in my room and he says, "" Go sit in your room to be depressed, You deserve this"". 
 Now, I don't even go into my parents room, my mother is a serial hoarder, she has things like old sandals from when my sister was a baby( she is 30 now), covered in termites, falling apart, still kept in her room, because she wants to give it to ""someone"", I don't judge her. My father does what he wants, eats a cocktail of medicines( India, yeah you can get everything here), and I try to advise him to not do it. Instead, I'm lectured on how I have anger issues, and how I don't know anything in life, how I'm spoiling his image, how I'm a failure. I don't even try to move a leaf even a millimeter in my house, just for the fear of being called a mad man with anger issues. Yet, here I am. 
 He owns a business, which I actively try to participate in (family business tradition in Indians). He berates me for not trying to expand the business, and when I try to, he says I don't know anything about life or running a business. Be damned if I do, be damned if I don't. 
 For me, leaving my home to go to another country to study, earn and prove myself was hard. After years of being told that I'm a failure, I deserve bad things, and that I can't put a foot right. I had to struggle to get to a point of a stable job without thinking bad about myself, ofcourse being in another country in a different timezone helped. As with everyone in this sub-Reddit, I was also subjected to the emotionally corrupt phone calls, guilt trips. Every time I spoke to them, I inevitably had a breakdown. Even after being 10,000 km away,somehow, I was still wrong, that it was me who was actively trying to  ""not get"" a job. 
 I ate once every 3 days, working 12 hour shifts in a restaurant, studying 20 hours in uni, fainting twice in a week due to exhaustion. My manager intervened, and gave me free lunch whenever I couldn't afford one, bless that guy. Got a job in an IT company, where even after being a top performer, I somehow always felt inadequate, that I wasn't good enough. 
 It's been 2.5 years since I came back from overseas completing my master's degree, and everyday I have been treated like this, coupled with my fiancee cheating on me just a month before my wedding, which again was my fault according to my father, his exact words being "" Even a girl left you, you deserve to be cheated on, you failure of a piece of sh*t"". Depression has been really bad in such an environment. 
 Coming back home to India, after battling to let me at least try to do something ""right"" according to them, always fell on deaf years. Their rationale being, you did all that in another country, we did not see all that. :'(, we don't believe you. 
 I'm going to get married in a few days, and I have decided to take a big decision to leave my parents house to start a new life, I don't want my partner to be subject to this sort of abuse, I want her to be happy and be her own person. Not be someone who isn't their self. I'll admit, leaving a house, and being the ""bad son"", who left his parents at this age ( Indian mentality), will be hard for me to face. 
 Still, I try to make a life for myself away from when someone incites you with triggers, and labels you a failure and a mad man. I want to be happy, and being on my own, although scary, would be the first step of recovery.","Abusive father,hoarding mother, triggers, blame game, I'm always wrong, I deserve this, la la la la la, moving out, starting a new life.

"Its 7 AM in the morning and i just can't sleep without any advice from reddit. Things are looking pretty fucked so i made a throwaway account and i'm looking for help now. I'll try to explain my situation briefly, even though it's a lot of shit to comprehend. 
 The story goes somewhat like this: Our relationship started in the winter of 2010, about 2 years ago. The late night MSN chats and all that jazz. She isn't that hot or anything, but damn, she made me happy as fuck. Told her how i felt in about april, so we were officially together. It lasted for a couple of months, until in late June i told her that we should take some time apart. I told her that i couldnt be without doing anything stupid - I though that since its summer theres all kinds of awesome shit to do etc. Then again I told her that it was far from over and we still saw each other frequently. She went to a summer camp in Germany and stayed there for 3 weeks or so. She had met this British guy there and were chatting online and things like that. I told her constantly that long distance relationships don't work out (ironic, since i'm a result of one) and didn't take that situation too seriously, since He was in england and we live basically in northern Europe. That kind of stuff still managed to damage my ego, so I payed a little more attention to her, because I didn't want to lose her. We never officially got back together, but did like an on-off thing constantly and saw each other frequently.  I think somewhere in this point she told me that she still had a thing for me and i felt like i owed her something for all the good shit she did for me. 
 The summer wasn't too bad - we were together constantly in our spare time, never in public, never officially. This is the part where me being an asshole started playing a greater role. It was nothing major, I just have a weird sense of humor, but i'm misunderstood a lot. This fall, after she had a trip with her class I was excited as fuck to meet her after a week. In her opinion, everything wasn't so great. When i got to see her, she didn't give me a good-night-type-of-kiss like i expected and that sucked, a lot. My mood turned to shit and i got really emotional. I tried to see what's up so she told me that she heard i kissed some girl in a club etc and she doesn't want to deal with me running around with random girls and then occasionally hooking up with her again because i feel like it. I understood that and tried to work things out and everything went well. (So i thought, atleast and i was mostly right.) We did all kinds of stuff together. 
 Christmas was really fucked up but for other reasons and that made me rethink about a lot of shit and i tried to reinvent myself and start 2012 in a correct way and so I did. In my opinion, things were going great for me  and I didn't want anything to change. Last week we attended a thingy that was a part of the project we were in. That meant we had to take a 4 hour bus drive to the capital city and take a private bus to the hotel we were staying at. The rooms were suited for 2 people so we took a room. I didnt sleep too good the night before and was beta as fuck the whole time and didn't do all the social activities the others were doing. I was waiting in our room, hoping that she would return to me and we could fool around. Eventually she came, but that wasn't until 4 AM. During the stay there, I kinda noticed that she was messing with this guy - hanging around him, playing with his phone and just messing around a lot. I didn't like it but i thought it's whatever. She had attended these project meetings several times before, so i cant really tell if anything was up before that. This weekend we're going to the city again to do some volunteer work with the project. We talked what kind of bus we should take back and agreed on the 10 PM one. I told yeah its not that bad we can just chill if we dont have anything to do. She told me that she had made plans for that night with the project guy from last week. That shit really hit me. Yesterday, we were driving around town, I found out that the guy is maybe going to a concert with her (it's in april though). Just as she was about to drop me off at home told her how i felt about seeing her mess around with a guy in front of me and that shit got me really emotional. We got talking on the internets. She felt like crying, because she doesnt want to see me be broken like that and told me that its not enough that i confess my feelings only when someone else appears in the horizon. She told me that mostly I acted like I didnt care and thought that we were free to do this stuff. We talked.. she told me its about to be 2 years and maybe she wants someone, who wants to be with her for real and for example behave right with her when someone else is around too. She wants the version of me that she originally met, she doesnt want to do the same mistakes like being convinced too easily. I told her that i'm not trying to convince her and that it shouldnt be a choice like that. She said that theres no point in making big conclusions after just few days and she doesnt want to make any descisions either. 
 The hardest thing for me to do is to talk about my feelings and i tend to troll and be a dick a lot in real life, i'm probably just trying to be delusional and not worry about pointless shit and it has backlashed on me. The only reason this has happened is because of me and it sucks. Btw, She's 18 and the guy is too, both graduating this year. I'm 17 and that's not helping","On-off relationship for almost 2 years, Recently another guy appeared and I don't want to lose the girl. 
 So after this long, dramatic story, here are my questions: 
 
 Wtf should I do?  I made clear to myself that I wont give up without a fight 
 Should I tell the guy to try to not fuck our relationship up?  Like with a facebook message. It would blow if she would find out about this, so its risky. 
 Should I try and be the nicest to her and try to cock-block the dude as much as possible? 
 Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did it go? 
 
 Leave me your best ideas. I will check this thread, and try to reply from my phone as much as possible. This is a battle i can't lose and i'm counting on you.

"So in my grandpas family there are 4 sons, from older to younger they are Homero,Zulema,Espartacus,Laisania. so when laisania got pregnant of me she was barely 14, because of her inmaturity and age, my grandma decided to take care of me as one more son,but she did not put a lot of attention on me.WhenI turned 3 I started spending time with my aunt Zulema and her recently husband Alberto,me a 3 year old kid not having the famiy that I wanted I told her I wanted to go with her,and because of Zulema and Alberto not capable of having kids they were really happy with it.The first night I was at my new home I spent the whole night crying because I wanted to go back,and they were crying and really sad and took me back, but it took me only one more night to go again withthem, and I never wanted to go back since that day, I have no memory of if something happened that day or something.The next few years were pretty normal the only difference between me was that because of mybirthdate and my new stepfather being teacher and working in schools, I skipped one year in kindergarden , so when I started elementary I was barely 5, while my classmates where nearly 7.Things were pretty normal until I saw for the first time my birth certificate, wich was completely different from the others that i had seen,instead of the word birth certificate being in the title, it said adoption certificate, wich made me realize I was adopted,and I cried the whole night, I asked my Mom zulema because that is what i always called her , well , just mom, I asked her if this was true and she told me the whole story , so when I was 7 , I found out all that. Ive never liked people to know im adopted, somehow it makes me feel less,so I always tried to hide the fact, as much as i could.When I was l 8-9 my grandpa from the side of my dad , passed away, and two weeks later a brother of his passed away too.My father was the best father i could imagine, but after that something in him died, and it changed everything about him.Now I was 10 and ive always wanted a brother so I cried to my mom every now and then saying that I wanted a brother , but they couldnt have one of their own but at the mid of that year my parents adopted another kid,lets call him jorge.When I was 11 my grandma , who alreadyhad cancer , got it again, and it was already really developed, one month later, my mom founds out my dad has been cheating on her, with a 16 year old kid, who was an old student of his.This had been going on soon after his brother died,that night my mom took me in front of my dad and her lover and my mom look at me and said , yeah carlosi1 this is your dads lover and he can go to hell and fucking die we are living on our own.I was in full shock as my 11 year old mind was not ready for this.when we went home, I was taking a shower, just sitting in the shower crying in shock, when I went to bed my father came by my side and was crying and apologizing . i was only crying i diddnt say a word.one month from this my grandma passed away, she couldnt make it to my elementary graduation .With all that was going through my mom's head, I had to take care of my little brother on my own,because my mom really was a mess, she attempted suicide 3 times,and she started working 2 shifts, so I was in charge of my brother.I remember one week after the divorce I was really hungry and my mom wouldnt do anything so I asked her what should I do and she told me, go to a friends house , so I called a friend and asked him If I could go because of my parents got divorced, he was like, am ok sure come here. I dont know why my mom told me to say that but I did. so the next few years go pretty normal but I already was different,Im a really shy person and It is hard for me being with other people,I also get very jealous like every christmas when I see my cousins hugging their dads and , i dont know it is something I really wanted.By the time I turned 17 my father was already married again, with that young lady, she was not a minor anymore, but still it started when she was 12 so.. my father has 4 kids with her now, and the two older ones are the same age that my brother jorge. now my mother being all lonely she starts seeking to meet with people, and she wanted to be with a cuban she met online, so she went to cuba and spent a couple thousand dollars to meet with this guy, so this guy being from cuba he doesnt have any money, so my mom spent a big ammount bringing him here, and it was a pain in the ass because I really havent seen him before, and one day he was in my house, like if he was the boss or something. now that im 19 i got caught with my marijuana, and my mom not being educated about it thinks that it is the same as heroin and that im a lowlife and whatnot.I recently moved out because of all the shit my mom was throwing on me, she said im not her son anymore,that im dead to her and she does not want to see me anymore, even though im going to school and currently looking for a job, so there is no way im a lowlife .I told her I was moving out because I wanted peace with myself and I was tired of being hurt because of other people choices. Ive dropped out of school for this semestes to find a work and to be able to live on my own on an apartment , but I cant find a job, so im living with my biological mother, who has other sons, and I feel so weird being in here, I just want to go on my own now but I cant, I have considered suicide because of all that im going through , but I cant, I want to live one happy life, but the shit is so deep I cant go out of it.","Adopted , lived with two families before this last one, step father turned out to be a pedophile who cheated on mom with a 12 year old kid, mother attempted suicide 3 times while I raised my younger brother.Now im on my own and my mom wont talk to me and said im dead to her",19,M,AskReddit
"Hey all, 
 I am not particularly depressed, nor am I really unhappy with life, however for the first time in a long time, tears came to my eyes late this night. Most likely due to the upcoming exiting of the military, which has marked my life since graduating high school, it is all I have known in my adult life. I have been away from home, besides small visits, since 2010. I have grown much more mature and appreciative of things in my life (particularly my very great childhood). I really can appreciate my parents for how helpful and loving they have been and continue to be throughout my life -- I am truly blessed. 
 I am accepted into a large university and have been preoccupied with feverishly 'planning my life' by reading through dozens of books on anthropology, sociology, and psychology -- trying to figure out what I would like to do for the rest of my life. I think this is in part my way of dealing with the reality of the unknowns, the lack of security and dependence that I have had the luxury of possessing (one of the few benefits) as a member of the armed services. This will be the first time that I face life as an adult, essentially on my own, at least in my perception. 
 I spoke with my dad on the phone today, realized I missed his birthday phone call, talked for hours, became extremely nostalgic. This late evening, a whole day of 'planning my life' down once again, and saw a picture of my grandparents (both long deceased). It was my father's mother's birthday today. It made me think of how quickly life passed by, how my father must have dealt with losing his parents, and then it returned to me, and how I will deal with my father and mother when they pass away. My father turned 60 years old yesterday.","I am about to face life as an adult on my own for the first time, I am utterly afraid of the unknown but working hard to plan my life, and nostalgic and fearful of losing the two people who were always there for me, who nurtured and raised me, and how I will deal with the reality of losing them and having no one to stand by. 
 Heh, feels good to get it off my chest I guess. Would really appreciate anyone who can relate or has been there to chat. Thanks guys.

"First thing first, I have a GF of the same age. Been together two years and some change now and things are well. We have a lot of the same friends, she's in stellar shape (better than I), we have fun together, hang out together , and live together. Sounds great eh? 
 BUT! I find myself lusting after other women and or wanting to go on dates... More so lately. 
 I go to college at a very international school and there are many beautiful women of all backgrounds at my school. My SO is plain American like myself. I find myself talking, chatting, etc with a lot of other women and almost flirty in a way.  The feeling of getting to know the opposite sex and feeling attraction and all the other emotions that come with meeting someone have won me over at this point. 
 I do truly care for my SO and she is a wonderful gf. Supportive, cooks, cleans, puts up with my BS, etc...  Sooo why do I feel this way!?? I have even on one occasion in conversation told the gal I was talking to that I didn't have a GF when asked. I did it subconsciously and I was actually kinda surprised at my self. 
 My dilemma is that I don't want to ruin what we have. Long term: I've discussed with my GF that I don't want to get married and plan my life around another's dreams. I am 26 and getting my degree in something that will take me traveling around the globe, my dream. She was conflicted with this but we talked thru it. We both moved to our current location knowing full well that we will only be living here for a short amount of time (under 5 years). We just happened to click and start a relationship. My case is why break up a good thing? We enjoy each other's company and have a good relationship.
 e live together in a beautiful place at an affordable price ( bc we split bills) which is very VERY uncommon in our location (Island). She takes care of my dog when I'm not available , we split rent, driving duties, pretty much everything. It takes my mind off a lot knowing I can rely on her. If we break up all this is gone, mutual friends, affordable split rent, nice home, dog care, support, warmth, etc... The list is long, but I am so afraid I will hurt her... 
 Why am I still interested in others? I'm kinda lost and all over the place, just like this post.","I am interested in other women but have a SO of 2 years that's wonderful, why and should I leave her and our great situation?",26,M,relationships
"Hi reddit, I'm in a tough situation and I'm not sure what to do. I'm a junior in high school, and I had a crush on a girl in her senior year, I'll refer to her as Jane. It started this past fall, and I started to get to know her better as the winter came on. Jane was easy to talk to, quirky in a really fun way, and I felt so happy whenever I was around her. I had always thought she was  way  out of my league, but I started to wonder if she had a crush on me, and I so I finally got my guts up and asked her out to a movie, and she agreed; I could tell she was really excited. 
 The thing is, I had never been in this situation before. In earlier years, I had been a little too under confident to try and pursue girls, and, I had never felt as strong an attraction as I did to Jane. So we had our first 'date,' even though it wasn't entirely clear that that was what it was. And it went so well; I felt so comfortable around her, and the way she acted around me seemed to communicate that she really liked me. The next day we saw a movie at my house, and afterwards, I officially ""asked her out."" She told me she wanted to hang out more first, but that she wasn't declining me, just postponing me. 
 So we kept getting together, and became closer and closer. I felt really confident that we would be able to have a relationship. She told me really personal things about herself, and I began to realize that she was a very complicated person. If anything though, this only made me more attracted to her. We talked about having a relationship, and she was still holding back, and after a month of this ""dating,"" I learned why. She told me that she had been involved in a secret relationship for the past two years with a college guy, and that although they had agreed it had to stop, she still felt attached to him. 
 Yet I thought Jane would be able to get over it. We were becoming closer and closer, and I thought that she would be able to forget about this 'mystery guy.' And the relationship became more physical; I experienced my first kiss, and I thought that she must surely be over this other guy by now. So I brought it up, and she explained how confused she was, and that she was still in love with this other guy, but at the same time she really liked me. She was also afraid to start a relationship now, seeing as she's going off to college. 
 So now, our relationship is in a strange place. She's my best friend, and I care about her more than I have ever cared for another person in my life. I'm not exactly sure how she feels about me. She gives me mixed messages, and I don't know what to do. I think about our relationship almost constantly, and I'm going a little crazy. Everyone else assumes we're in a relationship, but the truth is that we're somewhere in between. 
 She doesn't know how she feels, but I firmly do, and so that puts us in a strange place. She feels really bad about herself; she believes she led me on, and maybe she has. The thing is, I really appreciate her so much that I don't resent what's happened at all. What I really want is clarity, but she is so confused that she doesn't know how to give that. She's still in contact with the guy she still likes from college, and I've encouraged her to talk with him and try to settle things. I would appreciate any suggestions or help that you can give me, I feel kind of lost. I could write about this for pages but I tried to keep it as short as I can; feel free to ask any questions.","I am caught in a unofficial relationship with my high school crush, and after seeing each other for several weeks I learned she still has feeling for a guy she used to secretly date.

"I don't want to give away  too  many spoilers, but today we are going to create an insanely, intensely detailed story and populate it with myriad multi-faceted characters from all walks of life. 
 And I don't wanna to overwhelm you  just  yet, but here are a few details to percolate for you: 
 Me : a 19 year old student (name to follow from your orange envelope) fresh back from my [or her, if you prefer 3rd person] gap year (Thailand,  of course ), and straight off to a prestigious university. To study English Literature and Psychology. Delightfully indulged (or spoilt?) by my affluent parents. My interests include contemporary fashion, socialising, having my photo taken / selfies, telling people I'm not a hipster, vintage photography, and pretending to enjoy difficult literature and art. A self-proclaimed (pseudo) intellectual and feminist, it won't take more than a few lines of dialogue to realise that despite my dark hair, I am blonde inside, and a little ditzy at the best of times. I can be a little sycophantic and attention seeking, and there is no easier way of expressing this other than dressing vibrantly; disco pants, leather biker jackets, chokers, BlackMilk clothing, military boots, PVC skirts, hair accessories... Where did my parents think their 'textbook money' was  really  going? 
 The University : a typical, Ivy League institution; complete with protests, lame guys playing guitars on the quad, cheerleader try-outs and college sports. Except, something's not quite right here. Everyday, new rules for the female students are created and implemented, behind closed doors. 
 Article 291: female students are no longer allowed to wear trousers, shorts, leggings, jeans, chinos, skorts or any other trousered pants. 
 Article 371: female students are required to attend mandatory cheerleader practise at least twice a week. Disciplinary procedures to incur should this rule be broken. 
 The Florence Nightingale Library has been renamed The Ariana Grande Library and my coursework on Virginia Woolf has been rejected for not being contemporary enough; apparently a more 'relevant' female figure of today is Kendall Jenner... 
 And so on. 
 My friends and I will get to the bottom of this. But will we lose ourselves in the process? 
 Our cast will include an array of my beautiful friends, meddling, manipulative PhD students, vain but persuasive professors, celebrity features and much more. 
 Because this story is embedded deeply in 21st discourse, a narrative consisting of prose, scenes in my dormroom / classes / charity events, epistolary narrative (text messages), tumblr posts and other intricate details are required.

"Sorry in advance if my formatting is awful, I'm posting from my phone. 
 Okay. So, I'm finishing up my junior year of high school. Since day one of my freshman year, I've had three best girlfriends. We spent almost every weekend hanging out for two and a half years, except for one period last year when one of the girls became entranced with a guy to the point that she ditched us. We forgave her when she realized what she'd done, which is something that makes me very angry. Why, might you ask? 
 Well. The same thing happened with me, except to a lesser extent. Junior year, academically, has been rough. I've been focusing on doing the IB diploma, which is hell, and I just didn't have time to hang out anymore. I also became distant from my boyfriend, which is important later. 
 About two months or so ago, I finally realized that I'd been neglecting my friends. After a few weeks of reaching out to them fruitlessly (I planned a sleepover and all of them canceled on me, among many other failures) I  went to them and apologized, telling them that I hadn't meant to become distant but that I was willing to do what it took to be close to them again. 
 They rejected me. There was a whole list of reasons why I'm a bad friend and cannot be forgiven, chief among them the fact that I have a boyfriend; they assumed that I was lying to them about studying and instead was with him. I don't know why my apology wasn't good enough, but it was at that point that I got pissed. I'd been rejected and rejected, for no good reason. I was so hurt, and the fact that these people I cared about would hurt me like that made me angry. 
 I told all our mutual friends what had happened, and they are all doing their best to pretend like nothing happened. Meanwhile, I want nothing to do with these girls anymore. I'm still really hurt by what happened, I'm doing my best to avoid them all. 
 Here's where it gets weird, though, and this is why I ask the question I'm asking. Recently, they've been acting nice to me again. At least, two of them have. One goes out of her way to smile and say hi, another tries to sit with me at lunch. I don't ignore them, but I did make it clear that I'm not interested in patching things up. The third girl refuses to speak to me still, which makes things painfully awkward because she's the leader of a service organization I'm a part of. Basically, I can't do anything within that organization without talking to her, and she won't even make eye contact, let alone talk to me about events. This poses a major problem, because I need the service hours to graduate. 
 Stuck without any other options, I decided to join a different chapter of the same service organization. I told the adult leader the situation, and he asked me to really think things through and perservere with the first organization despite this girl. I don't want to do that, so I said that I was definitely leaving.  According to a fourth mutual friend, the three girls are all talking now about what a weird decision I made, and what reason I REALLY have for leaving. It confuses me to no end; these people told me they basically completely dislike me, but are weirded out when I try to avoid them? 
 Am I reacting right? How should I deal with this? I'm not really much for drama, I have no idea how any of this works or why they're acting this way. Can anyone give me some advice?","Three best friends rejected my friendship after I tried to apologize for focusing more on school than on them, yet they're trying to be nice and seem genuinely surprised that I'm trying to avoid them.

I love this person and its not something i wanna give up, but he doesnt want to fix things in therapy and thinks that we need to work it out ourselves.

"Edit: we're both 20! 
 So after a series of arguments, my girlfriend of 2.5 years and I have decided to go on a break for 2-4 weeks. I've had issues with her before and wondered whether to break up as mentioned here: 
 So, I've got about 2 weeks in which to decide whether I want to or not. If there is to be a good time for it, then it'll be after this break. She moves to Spain next month and she will be gone for a year. 
 I'm really confused and already I can sense this post is beginning to ramble. Long and short of it is: 
 She says she still loves me and thinks we'll be fine in the long term. I have my doubts. We come from completely different families with completely different values and I don't see that being helpful. She gets angry with me when I don't do things she approves of and expects me to tell her everything I do. Despite all this, she says that she wants to stay with me. 
 I still have feelings for her but I sometimes imagine that I could do a lot better if I were single. I don't know what to expect and don't want to make her sad, but maybe it would be a kindness? If I break up with her it's going to be tough.

"So I'm currently living with my mum and her girlfriend. We live in the UK in a three bedroom council rented property. When I finished school, I was pestered into getting a job. My mum said I should so that I could go out and do new things before I start having to work (I had guaranteed an Apprenticeship with an Electronics company at the end of the summer holidays), whereas her partner said I should so I can start paying them rent. I don't get on with her at all, and haven't done for the entirety of their 12+ years of relationship. I replied with something along the lines of ""this is my last proper holiday before I work for the rest of my life: I want to enjoy it. Besides, you can have fun without money"" each time they ask me.
As soon as I start working, I pay rent. I also have to pay for my own food. I don't mind that, but on an apprenticeship wage of 700 pounds a month, and paying them 150 pounds rent, it was a stretch: At the time I was paying for my car monthly, and paying for my driving lessons (they had said they'd pay for them like they had done her partner's daughters previously, but then suddenly changed their mind and paid for my license instead), so I had perhaps 80 pound for food a month.
Fast forward a year, and I'm now on 1004 pounds a month, paying for my insurance, paying rent, and paying to keep my car on the road. No problem. I'm now 18, and I'm looking to find a place of my own with some friends. The problem is however, that my stepmum's daughter now also has an apprenticeship, and as far as I'm concerned, doesn't pay rent or have to buy her own food.
I want to know if there is some sort of legislation that states I actually have to pay rent, as I'm still actually in full time education being in an apprenticeship, and I study at a college one day a week too?

"Hi guys, I have posted the same post on /r/nutrition/, but I thought I'd try my luck here as well. 
 I have just received a blood test results (safety check after 14 months of a vegetarian diet, and a fish once per fortnight). What got my attention is increased bilirubin. The first time I ran the test it was 2.2, the test was repeated after two days and it dropped to 1.5 (still above norm, should be between 0.2 and 1.3 [mg/dl]). I also have decreased leukocytes (3.23, norm being between 4.0 and 10.0 [thousands/μl]). I was not ill (I'm generally very healthy, no infections, not even common cold, nothing) and I have absolutely no symptoms, clear USG, AST and ALT enzymes within norm, so are all other blood test (including erythrocytes, haemoglobin, protein, etc.), no bilirubin or urobilinogen in urine, and generally more than average fitness. What's your opinion or advice? Why would bilirubin be higher, and drop/change so rapidly? What can be the reason for decreased leukocytes, given no noticeable change in immunity? Has this happened to anyone here? 
 From my own preliminary research I found out that beans & legumes are quite heavy on the liver (and so is the whole diet, because it is in general less nutrient dense), but there is in general no recommendation  not  to follow vegetarian diet from liver health perspective ([source]( Should I change the diet for two months and repeat the tests then?

I [34/m] get abnormally hurt when my [35/f] girlfriend turns me down for sex. Need advice. 
 When I say abnormally I mean, I seem to want sex at least once a day.  She doesn't.  We've discussed it.  Fought about it (once).  resolved it, I thought, but now I'm here again feeling the same way. 
 She only turned me down two days in a row.  First night, she was tired....I felt a bit unwanted...not a huge deal.  Turned me down again tonight, unfortunately the same night we're in bed and I learn yet more info of her many many many past fuck buddies (she fucked countless men of all sorts before me, regularly to fill her sexual needs then kicked them to the curb with no care for how much they cared about her or how much it hurt them, and apparently they usually did care about her, but she didn't.
This last piece of info was that she has rope in her closet, has been tied up with belts and all kinds of kinky shit.  We don't do kinky shit.  We have loving sex.  She claims it's the best she ever had (but wouldn't all women say that to an insecure man?...maybe, maybe it really is and that's why she's kept me around for a few months, wants me to move it, marry, kids etc, that's probably the truth....but I seem to have trust issues). 
 Irrational (maybe) me sees it this way: 
 
 She used to have a lot of wild sex and it was fullfilling enough to keep her happy sexually but not emotionally.  Sometimes it was kinky, sometimes it wasn't, but the way I imagine it from some of the stories it was always really hot....but according to her not truly satisfying especially in terms of orgasms, claims i kick ass on that (but why would she continually keep fucking so many if it wasn't any good?). 
 IF I lead the conversation towards enjoying some of the more wild aspects of sex, I learn that she's been there and done that, just not with me, but I can't ask directly or I just get told I'm so awesome... 
 I believe this to be because I showed my true self, insecure, and did everything I could to make her happy in these beggining phases of our relationship, even though I knew from the third date (and she admits to it openly) that I'm just not physically her type (I'm a nerd, she loves jocks). 
 I think I somehow fucked this thing up by doing all the wrong things 
 worst part is....I've never been unable to sleep and feeling rejected as hell after only 2 nights without sex before...for fuck's sake I was married for 7 years I know all about that.","I think I've got some serious insecurity issues

"Hi everyone. 
So I have been interested in MBTI for about a year so. Find it really fascinating. I'm convinced I'm an INFJ for several reasons, especially since the type description and functions match me to a T. How refreshing to find out there are others like me, at least in their thought patterns! yada yada. 
 Anyways I am a 25 year old guy in medical school. I have this 23 year old friend I absolutely love (in a completely platonic, non-romantic way). We have been friends since college a couple years back (almost 4 to be exact), and now he is in the same medical school as me. 
 Ever since I've known about MBTI I had a sneaking suspicion he was an INTJ due to the fact that we share so much in common except for the fact that he can be blunt and socially unaware at times. So yeah he tested as an INTJ. I'm really close to him. I call him my best friend. We share the same views about religion, politics, how to make the world a better place, and I have always appreciated his perspective because it's more logical and nuanced than my ""gut feelings."" 
 I do get paranoid about him though. I guess I just care about him so much that it almost seems impossible he feels the same way about me. On a superficial level I do more in terms of friendship maintenance. I call more, text more and generally make the plans. Occasionally there will be times I will ask him how he feels about me or being friends with me, and he generally views this as ridiculous, but I can count on him for being honest and telling me how he feels, which is the same as I feel for him according to his perspective. 
 I just don't get it though. I mean, is this generally how INFJ-INTJ friendships/relationships are? With the INFJ much more invested in the friendship and kind of getting the INTJ out of his shell (he is very quiet and reserved, and sometimes months will pass before he tells me something that has been on his mind). 
 I've read that INFJ-INTJ friendships have the potential to be amazing, and I definitely think I have a lifelong friendship with this bud. However, I do tend to get frustrated with doing more, so to speak, dealing with my friend's apparent lack of strong emotion and the inability to be comforting at times as a result, as well as an unawareness of when he is crossing the line and being offensive. The 'doing more' part is where I get worried that he doesn't feel as strongly about me or that maybe I am a burden on him. I really feel the need to have friends who reciprocate equally, and when that isn't there, no matter how great the person, I get irritated. 
His defense is that he just isn't good at keeping in touch, and he just kind of assumes that I will do the reaching out, but if that were not the case he would definitely make an effort to contact me. I should mention that I am extremely sensitive for a guy, and the description of HSP (highly sensitive person) fits me very well too.",I have this awesome friend who is an INTJ.

"Sometime around Christmas in 2012 my family and I were asked to come play music down at Valley Fire, the local coffee shop in town. Whenever we play gigs or go somewhere, I tend to pick out a pretty girl my age (if there’s one there) and pretend in my mind what would happen if I went and talked to her. Most of these “brain situations” as I like to call them, ended in me and the girl become boyfriend and girlfriend down the line. But this particular time, the girl was gorgeous! First of she was a redhead, and in my book, red is my favorite hair color, second, she was just slim and pale. But needless to say, in my head I’d already planned numerous dates and our wedding.
    We took a break from playing for awhile and I overheard a lady say something about Homeschoolers. That right there piqued my interest. As it turns out, this girl (whose name I later learned is Leah) was homeschooled, just like me! If she had my curiosity before, she took my interest then. I ended up talking to her mom for almost half an hour and she got me onto a list to be invited to a Homeschool Prom. Score! That would give me an avenue to see this girl again. But, like an idiot, I never found out the mom or the girls first or last name… So for the next few months I kept this girl on the back burner of my mind. Then the invitation came.
    It was an invitation for the Homeschool Prom! I was so excited I was almost giddy for a week in expectation of this dance! But alas, it was still a month away.
    I did do one thing that I am not proud of. I eventually found out the girl’s last name through the local newspaper, which her mom creates. And with that information I found Leah’s Facebook profile. I am and terrible person when it comes to Facebook. Whenever I meet a new person, I tend to creep their profile to see what they’re like. After seeing Leah’s profile, I wish I hadn’t creeped her, because she seemed like a really nice girl and I felt I was violating her privacy somehow… But, that’s all behind me now.
 So anyway, the Prom went awesom, I danced with her, and talked to her as well. She had added me on FB as soon as I'd gotten home from the Prom. For the next few days I chatted with her, and then one day I ran into her in a coffee shop! It was just her, me, and the shop owner there, so I ordered a coffee and sat down with her and we had an awesome converstation for almost and hour. 
 But I don't know what to do next, I don't have her phone number, and I don't know how to ask for it. And I know I need to get more friendly with her before I make any major move, but I want to know what you think as well.","met a girl at prom, talked with her on FB, talked with her in coffee shop, don't know what to do.",18,M,relationship_advice

"My partner and I got together when we were very young; it was my first serious relationship but not his. currently we have been in a relationship for over 4 years now, and I just don't really feel like it's going anywhere considering how long we have been together... I know this sounds petty but I know other couples both older and younger than us who are getting engaged and going on crazy travelling adventures together and expecting/have children and stuff even though they haven't been together as long as we have, and I just feel so jealous and sad about it... ): 
 we have spoken and expressed to one another a desire to potentially marry (he says we can become engaged after we have been together for 10 years, at which point I will be 26) and then maybe have kids after age 30 (again, his idea) and I'm just having trouble coming to terms with a 4+ year relationship that I feel isn't really going anywhere while others around us are moving on into different life stages with younger relationships than ours, which makes me personally feel self conscious because sometimes when people find out how long we've been dating, they basically ask me ""why aren't you married/why hasn't he put a ring on it"" blah blah all sorts of rude comments. 
 I know and feel in my heart that 20 is too young for me to be married, but I can't help but feel envious and angry about other people around us taking that next step while we haven't. I mean, if magically he were to ask me obviously I wouldn't say no but that would just mean we maintain an engagement and don't marry for a long time, which I would totally be okay with. I have jokingly asked him when he's going to ask me to marry him, and ""am I going to have to ask you?"" and stuff but I know he won't be asking me anytime soon, and I guess just because everyone else is doing it doesn't mean we have to as well, but I'm starting to feel like this is a dead end relationship. I always thought that after seeing someone for so long I would want to spend my life with them, and I can see myself with him forever, but this unwillingness to take the next step after being so committed to one another for so long is seriously making me doubt if I want to continue with the relationship for another 6 years and wait around for the possibility that maybe it'll take us somewhere... I love him so, so dearly but this has been nagging at me for a couple of months. 
 Am I being petty or pushy about it? I feel super bad for being jealous about my friends and acquaintances getting engaged. I could really use some advice on this matter, because I am at a loss and really would love to hear someone else's input about the situation. thank you so much for taking the time to read this.","bf of 4+ years hasn't asked me to marry him even though we want to spend our lives together, and friends with newer relationships are engaged etc.",26,F,relationship_advice
"Me [17F] with my SO [17F] of 1.3 years wants to break up because of distance. Need advice on how to cope : relationships 
 Hey Reddit, 
 So this was my first serious relationship with this amazing girl and it was almost near perfect. Unfortunately life decisions are causing us to seperate in the upcoming months with atleast a 6 hour difference between us. This distance will not go away for atleast the next 6+ years and I totally realize sustaining a LDR with no end goal is very difficult. 
 She said said she would like to break up and become friends as we get closer to going our seperate ways. Initially, I wanted to atleast give it a shot and see what comes of it - and if we were both truly unhappy I would be fine with breaking it off. I understand now, that this will only delay the eventual breakup and I support her decision as well. 
 I'm having difficulty with realizing what this means though. It bothers me when I realize I wont get to know the little things in her life or be a priority anymore. It bothers me that eventually she will get intimate with someone else thats not me. She was the first person I would tell when something happened to me, now I dont know who will listen to the little things with the genuine interest she had. Again, this is my first long term relationship so I'm wondering does it really get better. Will I wake up one morning and no longer wonder how she is doing? For now, some mornings I wake up feeling physically sick realizing that we will be near strangers in a matter of months.",First Longterm relationship (mutual) breakup. Having difficulty dealing with the eventual aftermath. Pls tell me it gets better.,17,F,BreakUp
"Alright, where to start... 
 I, [18f], just graduated from high school and am starting college in August. I just ended things with my long term boyfriend this April, because I was no longer interested in him and he reciprocated the sentiment. We ended cordially as friends. 
 Around this time, I started talking to a guy in my gym class, ""Damien"". He was nice, funny, and good looking. He knew that I had a boyfriend, so he was always respectful of that, but we talked a lot. He flirted with me and I was pretty sure that he was into me, but nothing ever progressed to be more than that. I went to prom with my ex-boyfriend as friends and he went with a friend of his. We graduated and I didn't really see him much after that. 
 But I really like this guy, like he consumed my thoughts and was the only thing I could think about. He went to Brazil for the World Cup and I was stuck in town. So, I hung out with other friends and tried to distract myself with sports, and friends, and summer in general, but I couldn't get him out of my head. 
 I started texting this other guy ""Nathan"" (who happened to also be in my gym class) and we became friends. We went running a few times and I told him how I felt about Damien. He told me that he wanted me to like him instead. I said that I didn't feel the same and that I was sorry. We continued to be friends. I should probably mention that Nathan told me that Damien knew I liked him and didn't do anything because Damien didn't like me. I thought, ""whatever, he's probably just saying this out of spite and anyways, it doesn't matter, because Damien is out of the country"". 
 So, Nathan invited me to come over and watch a movie with him (which I naively thought meant just watching a movie). We had hung out as friends before, so why would this be different? He kept trying to kiss me and touch me, but I kept saying no. Eventually I caved. I figured a) that I was an adult and allowed to make my own choices, b) I was single and hadn't even hugged a guy for months, so I was allowed to hook up with someone before going to college, and c) I hadn't talked to Damien in a few weeks and he obviously wasn't interested. So, we hooked up. No sex. It was fun, both he and I had a good time. 
 A few days after, Nathan is texting me, talking about how much fun he'd had and making plans to do it again. I kind of put the brakes on things saying that I didn't know if it could happen again and reiterating that this had been a one time thing. 
 So I went out with friends a few days following that, all while trying to stay friends with Nathan, but nothing more. I smoked marijuana with my friends for the second time ever and I got pretty high. (Perhaps not the best decision, but I was in a safe environment with people that I trust). I got home all courageous and figured that this was my chance, I was going to ask Damien to hang out with me or else regret missing this opportunity. And what do you know... He said yes. He was seemed excited to hear from me, we talked a little bit, and he went to sleep, saying at the end of the conversation that we'd get together soon. 
 The next day, he texted me asking what I was doing later in the day and I responded a while later (after getting back from a run) that I was free. Unfortunately, he had already made plans to see a movie with his parents and was unavailable. I was bummed, but it was a legitimate excuse. 
 The next day (today), I texted Nathan, officially ending things. I told him that I wanted to be completely honest with him about everything and that I knew he had feelings for me and it was unfair of me to continue. I told him that I had talked to Damien and that in the interest of being upfront with both of them, I was telling them both what happened. 
 And... Nathan was pretty mad. He said that this whole affair revealed a lot about my character and that I made all of the wrong choices that I would now have to live with. He told me that he knew Damien would never want to be with me and that Damien would hate me if he ever found out. 
 So Reddit, what am I to do? I went in with the full intention of being honest, and I ended up hurting a friend. Nathan has made me doubt myself and made me not want to tell Damien. I feel so incredibly awful about this whole thing. I wish I could take back the time spent with N, not only to keep him from hurting, but to ease this terrible guilt. I know that hooking up with Nathan was wrong, but I can't undo this. Do I even have a shot with Damien now? Do I tell him everything? I really like him and I feel like I've screwed everything up before it was even started. 
 I apologize for the giant, convoluted story. I hope that it made sense. Also, I apologize for the teen drama. Perhaps it's not as profound as some other posts on here, but I'm pretty lost at the moment and need some guidance.","I, [18f], have liked this guy [18m] for a while.

"Oh man.  I was a kid and me and some of the neighbor kids and my sisters were attempting to dig to china in a fenced off area behind my garage. 
 For some reason I got super excited I remember but I don't remember what about.  I think our ""to china digging"" at some point turned into just a good old fashioned treasure hunt and my shovel struck something hard so obviously being 6 or 7 I had either struck gold or an old treasure chest filled with gold.  Lol. 
 Sooooo I whipped my shovel around(Mind you this was a real shovel.  Not a kiddie shovel or a small digging shovel this was your run of the mill 5 foot long garden shovel --Dad was a former farmer and we had a huge garden in our yard--) 
 So I whip my big shovel around in excitement and pure jubilation ""WE'RE RICH"" then BAAAM!!!  Shovel hits neighbor kid right in the forehead!  the Kids down he's not moving!  OH MY GOD WHAT HAVE I DONE!?!?!?!!  Then I hear the best crying I've ever heard in my life then I'm crying, and my sisters are running to the house screaming, He's screaming, I'm screaming, my mom comes running the adults across the street(His Parents come barreling towards us!!!) ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE.  Ugggh.  And now my tiny 1st grade mind is going a thousand miles an hour picturing as many irrational scenarios as I can think of in a very short amount of time and by the time the adults arrived I was convinced I was going to be executed... just thinking Oh my god!! What's Happening?!?!? Oh no! OH NOOOOOOO!!!!  sigh 
 Long story short I cracked the poor kid's head open. 
He was in A LOT OF PAIN.  It gave him a concussion, stiches on the forehead out of school for almost two weeks.  his Parents HATED me after that FOOOR-EVUUUR FOOOR-EV-UUR.  Probably still do I guess.  At some point a fewvdays later I felt like WIll Smith in MIB when he accidentally released that weird little destructive ball -- ""IT WAS AN ACC--I-DENT.  And the rumors eventually spread at school, ""Hey did you hear J tried to Kill D?  Good lord.  It really sucked.  So yup.  I inflicted a lot of pain that day because I got a little overexcited about hitting some granite.  SMH.  My only solace weeks after it happened and I had a little time to work it out in my head is that it COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT Worse.  So I'm very thankful it wasn't because that would have REAAALLY sucked.",Hit the neighbor kid in the head with a big shovel while we were digging to china on accident and hospitalized him.

"Hi, I'm Jessica. And so thankful to have found this subreddit. I (finally) joined Reddit a few months ago after hearing about it for years through various forms of reads online. I'm still getting used to the fact that there really is a subreddit for everything. So when I thought to look up a sxe subreddit, I was pleasantly surprised. The past 3 or 4 years have been pretty rough for me. A not so graceful exit from high school, losing most of my good friends, growing distant from the ones I still have. A lot of it is, you've guessed it, because of my choosing to be straight edge. I claimed when I was 17 or 18. For a long time I refused to claim edge until I was 21 because being straightedge was such a trendy cool thing to do and I hated that. I mean, I guess if people are doing something positive for a portion of their life, that's good regardless. But I take this lifestyle seriously and people like that are why I (at the age of 20) am still not taken seriously. Anyways, one of my edge friends educated me on it as well as me doing my own research and I decided that it was the way that I was already living, finding out more about the culture and such just made it a lot more interesting. I'd love to befriend anyone feeling like they're in the same boat as me, it would be a blast to meet some neat, sober people.","thankful to have found sxe subreddit, claimed edge, lost friends, feeling lonely, want friends who share same values, hoping to make friends on this subreddit.",20,F,straightedge
"So this just happened today and I am actually getting back to the house. I fucked up big time reddit. And now I think it's time to change my lifestyle. After nine hours of jail. 
 So last night there was a big party and there was this country singer that my buddy got to come. He's a rising country singer but everyone in this vicinity knows him so this party was huge. Anyway, later on in the night I got very very drunk and then I slowly lost my memory of what was happening...... 
 I woke up around 7:30 to a police officer knocking on the car window. I am in a car I have no idea what happened. I am butt ass naked with a chick beside me in the passenger seat. She is straight up ugly. And she has one of those half shaved head thing going on. I get up, get my clothes on. We are in front of a watermelon field place and all these cops have seen my Lord Have Mercy. I am so ashamed. 
 I get booked in. I am charged with public indecency, and public drunkenness. The guy at booking tells me I won't go home until Tuesday. Today is a Saturday. Fuck. I have an American Gov. test Tuesday. After I get to spread my buttcheeks and get into my orange jumpsuit, the guy asks me if I want to call anyone. I tell him I'll just wait. I really don't want to tell my parents. Hell no. 
 I get put in the pod with a bunch of people that are involved with drugs. I'm very out of my zone. I don't do drugs, but I am pretty much an alcoholic. So I'm scared as hell. I'm 19. Underage. There was a couple guys my age in there. And that's when it hit me. 
 I don't want to be in here anymore. I am definitely not ""jail"" material. I certainly don't want my mom at this moment, because she would kill me. I'd rather be safe in a cell than see her at the moment. However, I realize that this is not what I want. This cannot happen again. I'm not coming back. 
 My brother works at the jail and so he gets word that I'm there. He calls people and I have pretty good connections so the sheriff of the county gave me bond, even though they don't get bonds on the weekends. Instead of the mandatory 12 hours in jail, I get out in 8. My mom is livid. I'm honestly scared to look my dad in the face. 
 I'm an alcoholic. At 19. This is the turning point. I've been lying to everyone, especially my parents. I'm going to have to tell my parents that I'm an alcoholic and I don't know how to do it. 
 Anyway, to wrap it up, I think everything could've been a lot worse. I have to go to court soon. So yeah. I'm so ashamed.","I went to a party, got drunk, drove a -3 chick and I out to a watermelon patch, got caught the next morning showing everyone my privates, and got out of jail today to my mom.

"My first post in /r/tifu and like most TIFU's this happened almost 6 years ago. 
 I was a junior in high school and I had this history with this girl named Danielle(name changed). To give you a little back ground about myself I was the nerdy video game/anime kid at school that everyone thought was going to shoot up the school. Thats not who I am/was but its who they thought I was. I met Danielle my sophomore year in HS. We had two classes together, one in which she sat right behind me. Now Danielle was (still is) 10/10 perfection. Blonde hair, blue eyes, nice body, beautiful smile. The whole nine yards. I was very aware of my social standing and appearance being the chubby kid I was and i never talked to her. She was out of my league. However, one day she started talking to me and we hit it off. Long story short we became really close over sophomore year, and she admitted to liking me. I of course was stoked, and i asked her out. She declined though saying ""she wasn't ready to be in a relationship."" I was fine with that. Schooled ended and we kept in touch over the summer. School came back around and I was able to see her again. We became even closer than we were. One day she asked me to come over and help her out with some math homework, as she wasn't very good at math. I said sure and I rode home with her and her mom after school that day. So there we were sitting at her kitchen table flirting non-stop with each other. I had gotten up to go to the bathroom, and when i came back she ran up and just gave me this huge hug. We sat there in each others embrace for a while just kind of swaying. As I was pulling away from the hug I looked to my left to look out the window for some reason or another.  Its at this moment I FUCKED UP. As I was pulling away I kind of felt her stand up on her toes and lean in. It didnt dawn on me then and i made some joke about her being short. The next day as I was walking to the bus it hit me. She tried to kiss me, and i blew it. I thought this over and over and over again and this is the only conclusion i can think of. I done this every day for almost 7 years.",I fucked up because i didnt realize 10/10 girl was trying to kiss me.,23,M,tifu
"Very long story, I'll provide details if its really needed.  But I'll try to cover it quickly. 
 I graduated college a few months ago, and I had about 20k saved up from my part time job in college.  I was on a full ride, that gave me alot and provided me with spending money, so any money I made was just saved.  Hence the large amount of money I had left over and no debt!  Yay!  Then life screwed me over. 
 The economy affected me just like everyone else and I graduated without a job.  So I was just going to get an apartment and live on my own until I managed to knock one down.  But then out of the blue one of my family members got sick.  Like real sick and needed money, I was the only family member she really talked to on our side, so I went ahead and fronted her the money for the operation.  Things didn't go that well, and now I'm left with a little over 3k in savings and living at home.  I still don't have a job. 
 I'm from a poor family just leave it at that.  My parents are proud of what I did but they are really really really annoying.  Just their general parenting style.  They're supportive, but I can't stand them. 
 I'm 22 1/2 years old and they treat me like I'm 5.  I can't handle it, the only reason I'm back here is because I decided to give a family member a shot at living, not like I'm some deadbeat.  It's too long to explain so I'll just leave a list of how absurd my parents are (I'm chinese if it makes any sense, these are just a few examples, it happens on a daily basis): 
 
 Dad yelled at me because I didn't pick him when his car broke down.  He didn't call me, but he said ""when you noticed I'm not home at 7, and its 7:30 you have to call and ask whats wrong.  I shouldn't have to call you.""  WHAT SENSE DOES THAT MAKE?  WHY NOT JUST CALL ME, I ask him that and he's like ""A good son would know, I was testing you."" 
 
 He literally sat in the rain and waited for me to call and come out, instead of just calling me. 
 
 They make me ask to leave the house, even if its like 7 pm, I have to let them know where I'm going, and the time I'm going to be back. 
 
 Dad yelled at me for not being in debt with the school.  because ""good students would have stayed in and gotten more debt and bettered themselves if they didn't have a job"" exact translation.  WHAT SENSE DOES THAT MAKE? 
 
 My grandma was sick, I called her to ask her if she was okay.  She said she was fine and she was going to go to bed.  My dad called me ""A worthless fucking faggot"" and told me to drive over there.  After an argument I drove over there and made my grandma get out of bed to answer the door and send me home.  He then calls my grandma to make sure I went to visit her, and he received a lecture from her. 
 
 I asked my dad how the weather was, he told that I should ""Fucking watch TV and find out in case something severe happens"" so that I can ""sacrifice something for the family"" 
 
 I had a white girlfriend, he called me a piece of shit for dabbling with the devils.  So I didn't bring her by again until the day we broke up.  He then must have said something because my uncles started asking me if I had a girlfriend, and when I said no, they started to call me gay and start laughing.","How do I knock some sense into my parents?

"Hi everyone! You know the drill: love this sub, have sketchy stories, decided to finally post one. There are a couple of things you should know: first, this is a long story. Brace yourself. Also, I'm a girl (the story doesn't make this point obvious.) Also also, I'm on mobile, so if there are spelling errors, let me know and I'll fix them. Now that those are out of the way, here goes! 
 My mother and I first encountered Creeper on the first day of school in 2007. I was a junior at the time and I happened to get out of school a few minutes earlier than my third grader sister, Hannah. Since I didn't have my license, I would go in the elementary school every afternoon and wait for Han's dismissal with Mom. Creeper struck up a conversation with us that first day. Before anyone calls me out on rule four, please know that we really don't remember his first name. That is legitimately what we have called him for six years. What we do remember is that he's not from our small town, but he married a woman who graduated with Mom. He has two step sons, one being a classmate of Hannah's. Appearance wise, he's around 5'6 and on the scrawny side with a George Costanza hair line and glasses. He didn't really seem out of the ordinary until he started driving by our house. 
 We live on a rural road that serves as a ""back way"" to one of the biggest cities in our state. Hundreds of cars go by every day at 45 MPH, so it was easy to spot the little silver Toyota never exceeding 20 mosey on by 3-5 times a week, minimum. Always staring the entire time. But, my Mom is a beautiful person, ao we had become accoustomed to sketchbags. We still didn't see cause for alarm, but we did steer clear of him at the school. 
 In the winter of 2010, Creeper decided to up the ante after three years of drivebys. Mom was coming out of the grocery store by herself one day. She rounded the corner of her SUV to see that familiar silver car. She was digging through her purse for her keys when she heard the whir of his window. 
 ""Brrrr... Cold one, isn't it?"" He said. 
 ""Yep,"" she responded curtly, still digging. 
 ""Well, geez, why don't you warm up in here?"" 
 ""This is my car right here,"" she said, stating the obvious. At this point, she found her keys and started hurling groceries in at warped speed. 
 ""Well, yeah, but mine's all warm!"" He was much more brazen when she was alone. 
 ""No thanks."" She flung her cart into the return bay and quickly made her escape. 
 During the warmer months, he began pulling in the end of our driveway. He gets out occasionally and kicks the tire. One day, my step father was outside working on his truck. He works away most of the week. When Creeper saw him, he quickly got in his vehicle and burned rubber during his mad dash out of here. Don't let that fool you, that instance did not deter him. 
 Just this past February, I was woken by the flashing lights of a wrecker just after 7 AM. During an early morning stalk sesh in the midst of a blizzard, Creeper had slid off the road into a ditch ten feet past our mailbox. Bet that was fun explaining to the wife and kids. 
 Some of you may ask why we haven't called the police... His wife's family is ""prestigious"" in this small town and they have connections to the police department. We, however, have no significant last name. Since Creeper hasn't technically done anything wrong, there's nothing to report. But, I figured I would document my story here in case he gets more brave in the future. He pulled in the driveway again this afternoon. 
 If you made it all the way to the end, thank you! As a special treat, I'll leave a couple funny stories involving Ole' Creeps in the comment section.","Family has been stalked by my younger sister's classmate's step father who enjoys slow drives by our house multiple times a week and trying to get my Mom alone in his sketchmobile.

"I'm sorry I posted here and I know my post would be a better fit in /r/SuicideWatch or even /r/relationship_advice since it's about my troubling relationship with my mother. But none of those will give me valid advice because of cultural difference. 
 I feel the people in /r/islam will be able to relate or at least understand my agonies. 
 I'm a 26 yo woman, single, living with my extremely controlling mother and brothers who are in one way or another indifferent towards me. I've been working as a teacher for the past 3 years. We live in a country considered middle eastern, even though it's not geographically located in the Middle East. But we share the same culture, language and religion. 
 My mother is a traditional woman, she's 62 now, and her mentality has always been stuck in the 1960s. She's controlling, possessive, paranoid, and always assumes bad things of people. Of course, she has some good qualities, people aren't black or white, but her negative ones are directly affecting my life. And simply my ability to lead a normal peaceful life. She and I just cannot co-exist. She's always telling me what to do, her orders are nonstop, do this, do that and so on. I'm not exactly a traditional girl. I don't care for cooking and cleaning. I do my best, but my best is never good enough for her. 
She always belittles me, she always treats me like a 12 yo. Never respects me, and when I answer back, she gets offended and proceeds to slap me. The only place that I feel as a worthy human being is when I'm at work, where people appreciate me, respect me and treat me for who I am, a competent adult. Unfortunately I only work part time and thus I spend more hours home than at work. 
 It doesn't stop right there, in the past few month I have found myself with no friends left. I have been blessed to meet women my age, who are educated, respectable, trustworthy but each time I make plans with friends (that mom already know who they are) she'd interfere and not allow me to meet them. As a result they will eventually refrain from making plans with me because they think I'm sloppy, indifferent and not punctual. Over time, I stopped trying to befriend people because I wouldn't be able to go out with them and do things that friends do. 
 I'm introverted to some level, but I still like to hang out with friends once in a while. Nothing too liberal for her, just having lunch in a restaurant near my home or taking an afternoon walk downtown. 
 Again, it doesn't stop right there. I am an ambitious person, I worked hard and got my master's degree and would love to continue studying, or developing my career as a teacher. Numerous opportunities presented themselves in front of me and I could never go for it. No matter how much I begged, she's the most stubborn being on earth. She sees no value in furthering my education, getting a better fulltime position in another city, or getting a grant to study abroad. And my brothers never supported me, I know it'd make a difference if they do. But it's not like they care so they take her side. 
 The frustration I get from not being able to pursue my dreams and being trapped is the hardest thing I have to live with. It depresses me and makes me feel like only ending my life is the way out. Being a Muslim is what has stopped in the past from moving forward with it. The only change mom will ever allow is getting married to someone she approves and that's another thing that depresses me. It's not only that I'm not allowed to fulfill my professional ambitions, I am one day going to marry someone I don't love, someone I don't know just because that's what she wants. She fails to understand that this is my life, and I have the right to make my own choices. She fails to understand that she and I are different people who belong to different generations and want different things. And she fails to understand she had her own life to live, and she made her choices, and just because she birthed me, it doesn't give her the right to control me for life. She says, she'll stop interfering with my life once I get married. Well, if I can't even meet girls, things are a whole lot worse with meeting men. Not that I'm even thinking about it. 
 What do I do about this? Do you know of anyone who lived in similar circumstances and managed to emancipate? 
 I'm not a suicidal person, I love life, and wish I could get a little more out of it. But if things continue to be this way, I don't see the little iman in my heart will stop me from ending my life. 
 Another thing that agonizes me is that Islam calls for respecting and obeying your parents. But she leaves no margin for me to love and respect her, we fight all the time. I wish there was anything I could do to have a normal mother daughter relationship. It pains me that I am therefore not a good Muslim because of that and that I'm probably angering Allah.","My mother is obsessively controlling and stands in my way of pursuing my dreams or simply leading a normal life. And because I have no say over anything in my life, depression started getting to me and I have suicidal thoughts.

"Myself (22 F) and my boyfriend (23 M) have been together for nearly two years now and we get along really well. We're on the same page for the most part when it comes to the important stuff. Lately, I've started to feel like a ""come over and chill"" girl which is definitely something I don't agree with. 
 Recently, since my boyfriend moved into a place of his own without a roommate, he's been asking me to come over to his house all the time. Compared to how often we went out before, this is a drastic change. We used to go out and do things (lunch, movies, dinner, even just a walk) at least twice a week (we try to see each other more than this of course but because we both have full-time jobs and other commitments it can be hard). But now, I'm lucky if we go out once a month! Sure, we go outings with his or my family but those are a bit different. And whenever I do come over, or when he asks me to come over, he's always wanting to have sex. Don't get me wrong, it's nice, but as someone with a low libido, I'm not always in the mood and even if I was, 90% of the time there's no romance to it. 
 It also doesn't help that we live 40 minutes away from each other on opposites sides of town. And it sucks since my job means I start really early and don't finish until about 6pm. So if I go to his place after work (and include an hour round trip of driving) I'm lucky to get home before 10:30pm. Another thing I've noticed is that he no longer comes over to my place. I've asked him to come over to mine instead of his (I live with my parents and my younger brother still) but he always says that his anxiety is playing up and that he's tired of being around people so he prefers his house. I don't want to be that person and say that he's using anxiety as an excuse (it's not, I myself have social anxiety) but I often feel like he uses it as a way to get me to come over; since there is really nothing you can say to that without sounding like an asshole. 
 I understand that has relationships become more comfortable, date nights don't happen as much as they used to, but now there is no romance, he often refuses to come to my place and I'm starting to feel a lot like a booty call. So my question would be, how can I fix this? How can I say that as much as I like chilling with him, that I don't like constantly going over to his place for sex and that I still like going out to the mall, to the park or even just a walk without sounding like a high maintenance bitch?",Boyfriend wants me to come over to his place all of the time for sex and uses anxiety to get out of coming to my place.

"To be more specific, I (25M) go to a popular climbing gym near my work twice a week or so (more if I'm lucky) and this girl actually works at the gym. I've been going pretty consistently and she is always there and always remembers my name. I am actually surprising myself by posting this on here because I have never been nervous about approaching a girl I'm interested in... until this girl. 
 She is always so happy and talkative and laughing (even when the gym is beyond crowded and busy) and honestly when I see her there I find myself staring; she is stunning. Not sure how old she is but I know she graduates next year from the best college around, so probably around 20-22. 
 I have managed to make small talk with her on a few select occasions and I am starting to wonder if she is just simply out of my league. She's intelligent, sexy as hell and always smiling, and I know for a fact I'm not the only guy in the place who notices her. I can hear her laugh across a room. She isn't conventional - she rock climbs (probably harder then me) and I saw her leave once with a motorcycle helmet in her hand. I feel like I am in freshman year all over again, some fumbling idiot drooling over a hot girl. But she is different! Redditors, how should I let her know I am interested, and possibly ask her out? I doubt I could get her away from her work long enough for an actual conversation, as it is always so busy in there.

"Hey guys. My first post in this section. 
 Sorry for the wall of text in advance. 
 Title says it. My girlfriend and I have been going out for 5 years now. I'm 25 this year and we were friends since high school. we even liked each other in high school and flirted a lot. For the last few months I noticed things that were kinda weird that she would do or say. Not to the point where it was a red flag but just barely noticeable. I didn't think TOO much of it.. but it did make me feel a bit weird. So I did make more effort to spend time with her and stuff.. just not to neglect her in case something was wrong. It feels like I almost did that unconsciously though, because I never really sat down and thought to myself: ""okay, something's wrong"". 
 Anyway she told me she was thinking of breaking up for the last few months because ""she didn't see us together in the future."" After talking, she still claims to love me, she still claims that our personalities are perfect for each other, she still claims that she will miss me. She cried so much while we were talking, and when I asked why, she kept saying she's going to miss me. She didn't even want to leave at night because she said it's so hard and she doesn't want to leave. 
 So I have no idea what to think at this point. I asked all the normal questions like if I did something wrong, if there was another guy, if she just felt like she committed to a long relationship too early.. she said it was none of those things. Simply, ""I don't see us together in the future"" and ""we're not the ones for each other"". She kept repeating that she really hopes she's not making a mistake, and asked me ""What if I'm making a mistake?"" Additionally, the thing that messes me up the most is that she REALLY wants to be friends. I don't know how to handle that. 
 In my mind, it's a battle between my ego/dignity and the how much I want to be with her. On one hand I want to talk to her and be friends with her because I love spending time with her. But on the other hand my brain is telling me it's a bad idea because every time we talk, she's going to be tapering off of me, while my hope of us getting back together is just going to grow. And eventually when she stops talking to me altogether, or finds another guy, I'll be left high and dry. 
 So Reddit please shed some light. I'm sure many of you guys have gone through very similar things. Any advice is helpful. How I should act. How I should handle talking to her. What I should do next. It feels like she was the source of inspiration and motivation for many things in my life such as trying to become successful so we can enjoy a good life together. I feel so unmotivated now. I'd also appreciate it if you guys can draw on past experiences as well. 
 Additionally, I'm getting majority of the people saying I should cut my ties completely with her.  But to me it seems like all they hear is ""we broke up-"" and then their initial reaction is ""u have to move on"".  But as 1 of my close friends who's been in a 5 year relationship and broke up and got back together with his girlfriend said: it might actually be beneficial to still talk to her from time to time (sparingly of course) just so that if and when she's ready or realizes she made a mistake, it will be easier for her to tell me.  I'm really confused and not sure what to do.  It feels like I should just follow what my heart is saying and take the ""L"" if it ends up being a big mistake.  My current mindset is that, I rather wait a bit and still keep some type of contact with her, so that if nothing happens, at least I'll know for sure.  I don't know if I can live with myself if I'm always questioning the 'what-if I lost the love of my life because I didn't fight for her"". 
 Anyways I'm really looking for any heartfelt and honest thoughts, especially those drawing from your individual experiences.","My girlfriend broke up with me but is not really giving me the clear reason why. I don't know if it's because she doesn't know the reason herself or if it's something deeper.

"Hi. I'm a 22 year old guy who has absolutely no idea how the whole dating/relationship thing works culturally. I live in Western Europe (Belgium to be precise). I've never had a girlfriend but am actively trying to find one. 
 I've been hearing tons and tons of theories about why I can't get a girlfriend, what I should and shouldn't do etc etc. Everyone tells me different things. I've also tried the ""do it with your heart approach"", by just doing what I feel I should do, but that leads me to fall in love with the girl without getting a relationship out of it. 
 I'm not quite the most social person, but I think I'm not a total social retard either. I'm open to other people and easy to talk to. I might be a bit shy and lack a bit of self-confidence but I'm working on it. 
 I actually have a lot of questions and would like to talk one on one with someone that is really experienced and mature on the matter. Through any message sending system, be it Skype, email, anything else, whatever. 
 But since this is a subreddit I'll ask some of my questions/insecurities here, even though I'd really want to have a discussion. 
 1) I hear people say that finding a girl is 100% physical attraction, and that the rest just doesn't count. I guess that is at least partly true because I can get very good friends but no girlfriends. But how true is it really? I am a bit overweight (85kg for 180cm). Should I be focusing on looking better before trying? I personally don't really have problems with my appearance. 
 2) Talking to a girl for the first time is not really a problem for me as I believe that whatever you say won't really change anything, except if you hurt or insult her. How much does first impression really count? I mean except on the physical side? 
 3) How do you make it clear quickly that I'd be interested in something more than friendship with a girl? I think that's one of my biggest problems, I get too close to girls before really saying what I think. I try complimenting her looks, saying she's cute (without being obnoxious...), but sometimes I don't feel the message really gets through. 
 I went on dates with girls that didn't know at all we were having a date, even though we were just two and well. That's a date right? Or should I actually litterally tell her ""let's go on a --> date <---""? 
 4) How much is too much? See I've done the ""fall in love, she doesn't like me, cry like a bitch"" thing multiple times, so I'm getting kind of desensitised... And I keep finding interesting/cute girls. But sometimes, or often, those girls might know each other. Should I take that into account? I'm a bit scared of looking ridiculous by asking everyone out (well I'm exaggerating here...) 
 5) A special question... How do things work in  China ? I don't know if there's any Chinese here, but I meet a lot of Chinese girls and I'll be in that country for a while soon, and I know that the ""dating culture"" is totally different there. Can anyone explain that to me?","22M, never had a girlfriend, I need someone to explain how relationships work in details, because I feel like a lack a methodology. Would very much like to have an open discussion 1 on 1 with someone who's experienced with it.

"I have never been in a serious relationship. I got feelings for a girl one time in 6th grade. I know it sound really young, but my I got mentally mature early. She was my crush and we used to talk all the time. I thought about her a lot and had a good feeling everytime I thought about her. One evening she asked me if we could be a couple. It was one my luckiest moment so far and I accepted. The morning after I got a text message that she's ""breaking up"" with me because she doesn't love me, she just wanted to know if I liked her. 
 After this I have never been in a relationship with a girl, simply because I don't really trust people. I have made out with many girls and I've had sex as well, but no feelings included. 
 Another thing is that I associate love with something bad that always ends up in broken heart. When I grew up the relationship between my mom and dad was shit. They always fought and I can't remember any good memories between the two. They divorced last year. 
 But last weekend I met this amazing girl. In my eyes she's the most beautiful person I've ever known, even though the friend I mentioned her to said she's average looking. But I just can't stop imagine her face. She was also really sweet, but kinda bad at the same moment. She added me on facebook, followed me on Instagram and added me on snapchat. We have only snapped each others a bit, but I don't really care as long as I get to contact her. I think about her  all  the time and really wants to ask her out or something if she doesn't ask me out first. 
 Feelings and personal life is something I've  never  expressed. I always keep things to myself and never feel anything but friendliness towards people, so its a really weird feeling I got right now. I've always pushed away girls who has shown interest in me, but this girl is just amazing. I also never thought that the girl I would fell in love with (if I ever did) would be like her, but now I just can't control myself.","Never really felt anything strong for people, got  really  strong feelings for a girl I just met.

"This may very well end up being a wall of text but I really need some objective advice. This is also a throwaway because the boyfriend/ex? is a redditor too. I'm 20F and he's a 24M. We have been dating for nine months and up until now things have been pretty good. We had fights occasionally but there was never anything too serious. We supported each other and he made a lot of progress in improving himself and becoming happier (was previously depressed). When I met him he was obese, a high-school drop-out and didn't have a job. A few months later he found a job where he does well, got his GED, enrolled in college courses and is almost at a healthy weight. I helped him with a lot of this and he's been very kind and good to me. I've been nothing but happy these last few months. 
 Then this January everything fell apart. He just started school and he's having an extremely hard time managing his hours with the amount of school work he has. He's got a bit of social anxiety and is easily stressed so this made his stress levels balloon up. He also got into a car accident and has to pay back the debt on that. He's got a bit of current credit card debt he's working on and then his ex-girlfriend contacted him saying that he needs to pay previous rent from their old apartment because her pay is being garnished for it. So in a very short time span, he got hit with a lot of money problems, stress from school and his work giving him too many extra hours. Then to top it off we ended up getting into a huge fight. 
 The reasoning for the fight was stupid and I don't really think it mattered. The fight stemmed from that basically he was being distant for a while. He stopped texting and talking as much, stopped saying I love you and we were barely hanging out as it was. I felt rejected and it ended up getting so bad because he never told me anything. This entire problem has pretty much been because he never once told me what was bothering him or why he was a mess. His emotional breakdown just kept building and I was kept in the dark about it. 
 We had a close breakup during this point but he kept telling me he wasn't sure what he wanted so it never ended up happening. I was miserable this entire time and just wanting to know what the hell what going on. Then last night, he told me to come outside. I went outside my house and he very plainly told me he was breaking up with me. I took it very calmly at first and he immediately descended into a sobbing mess. I finally told him to just go home because he broke up with me! Was I supposed to comfort him? I cried over the next few hours and talked to friends because I figured what else could I do. It just came out of nowhere when he was saying not too long ago he wanted to make it work. There was a couple hurtful things said between us after that point and I had a friend contact him so that I could pick up my stuff. I just wanted to get my things and go no contact. I had blocked his number, removed him on Facebook and was prepared to just start healing because what else was there to do besides cry? 
 I drove over to his apartment ready to grab my stuff but the door was open and my stuff wasn't there.  I walked in and he's sitting on the floor just sobbing and appeared to be having a complete and utter meltdown. I started to grab my stuff and go and I just kinda asked ""why"". He kept saying he didn't know and he couldn't think and that everything in his life is going wrong right now. He was also saying a lot about how he was afraid to make the same mistakes with me as he did with his ex. 
 Quick note! His ex and him dated on and off for seven years. It was an extremely toxic relationship and he stayed even though they were both miserable. This is when his life fell apart and he put on the 100+ pounds. 
 He was terrified that he will forever regret dumping me but also regret it if we get back together. I kind of just sat on the floor and talked to him for a while. There was all this rambling about how he doesn't want to hurt me and he's sorry. It was really confusing. He asked me what was my real reason for coming to pick up my stuff and he knew it was because I wanted to see if it was possible to fix this. It was hard denial with everything getting thrown at me at once. I finally got up to leave and he grabbed me and we kind of fell to the floor. He was holding on really tight and I started to panic thinking I was going to be assaulted or something. It wasn't rational because he's never hurt me but I'm basically suddenly being tackled to the floor. I started crying hysterically and he just held me telling me to breathe and that this was him taking that second chance. 
 We talked for a bit afterwards and discussed what we were feeling and how things might need to change to get past this. The thing I'm so bothered about is that he basically admitted that he wasn't going to chase after me. If I hadn't come over it would have been done. I keep sitting here thinking about this and thinking if he wanted to be with me for real, he wouldn't have done this. If he had truly regretted it, wouldn't he had called and apologized? But I never got anything until I made that move. Every online guide to no contact says don't talk again unless they seem really remorseful. He was miserable. I could see that but he didn't take that initiative. He was prepared to deal with his decision and let me go. Am I making the wrong choice by trying this again? Is it just dumper's remorse? Did he just make a bad decision because he was having a meltdown that built over the last few weeks? I just need someone else's opinion.

"So first and foremost, a little bit of background. I am a nineteen year old female that has been going through an incredibly tough time for most of my life. My dad was a cocaine addict and my mother is emotionally unstable. My dad walked out of my life when I was fifteen along with the rest of my extended family. So it has been just my mom, my brother, and I living in a small one bedroom apartment for going on three years now. 
 I really loved my dad in a blind not at all healthy kind of way and it really did a number on me. When he left, I had just entered my first relationship and everything was good at first and filled with puppy love. But over time this guy withheld physical and emotional care from me. But I stayed. I was with him for four and a half years and we never moved past heavy petting. I dumped him this summer and started spending a lot of time with a twenty year old guy (We'll call him Bob) that I had known for almost two years from my high school. 
 I really looked up to this guy and thought he was so much fun to be around. We played video games together and sent texts all day everyday when we weren't online. Now Bob was really flirty even though he had a girlfriend but I did not indulge him by flirting back. Eventually he wore me down though and one day asked me if I would ever want to have sex with him. Now I was a virgin and he's a good looking guy so I told him the truth and said yes. He told me that he and his girlfriend had an open relationship and we could make it happen and it did. Well I started to fall for him hard. 
 This whole time I've been battling feeling lost and confused with what I want to do with my life and just generally feeling very depressed and not motivated. I attempted suicide a month ago, Bob finds out and tells me he doesn't care if I live or die, I get hurt and ask for an apology and he decided to entirely ignore me and has not responded to a single text or call from me since and I actually admitted to him I loved him. 
 Now I am completely alone, I have no friends because I burned all those bridges in my four year relationship. My mother is constantly on my case for not pulling myself together and just moving on already. I don't have my license, I just started my first job but the hours are very sporadic. So I have a lot of time at home and no motivation. I am still very depressed but I want to pull myself out of this and exercise, eat healthy, be happy, and just generally feel good about myself for the first time ever. It would be nice to be able to throw away my trust and body issues.

"I [f 17] and my so [m 22] have been in a LDR since 4 months. A little less than a year ago we've met on omegle and we've purely talked and shared music links for like 2 hours. Long story short, we accidentally got disconnected and in the end we found each other again. Anyways so we talked on kik everyday etc. After awhile we told each other that we liked each other but we didn't really do anything about it, maybe because of the age difference. 
 So one day in July he completely just cut me off. I was angry and eventually forgot about him. Then in late Nov, he randomly messages me and wants to rekindle our friendship or whatever. I'm still slightly pissed but I'm like okay, sure. He eventually apologizes for what he did, and we continue to kik. 
 Fast forward to jan, and we establish that we're together. Everything is fine and i like him and vice versa but there's this thought that always crosses my mind. I cant help it, to think of breaking up with him because I don't want to get hurt like last time. Ever since nov, I've never fully opened up to him and has been on guard to not fall hard for him.

"Wow guys, I really tried to make it concise.  Sorry for the wall of text. 
 Some Background:I knew John (not real name) in high school, and we started dating senior year. We now go to different universities and do long distance while school is in session. We’re both incoming juniors, so we’ve been dating for more than 2 years. He’s the sweetest guy, and very serious about our relationship. 
 I always knew that John played video games, specifically LOL and other online stuff (more recently it’s been Magic, which is the same principle). I wasn’t the most enamored, and he knew that. At the beginning of the relationship, he would sometimes complain that I didn’t take an interest, or seem bored when he talked about it. He asked me to play with him, and I did a couple times, although admittedly I didn’t try super hard. When it became apparent that there was no way I would ever shake my distaste and become enthusiastic about gaming, he kinda gave up. We just don’t try to talk about it anymore. 
 Gaming’s just not my thing. I don’t like it; I get antsy and bored, and feel like it’s a waste of time. I know that people have different opinions, and that’s cool- we all have our hobbies.  I don’t really care that it’s something he does. What does bother me is the fact that gaming is how he connects to people. All his friends are gamers, and whenever we hang out with them (we have mutual friends) they just sit around playing LOL or Magic the Gathering. And it’s all they talk about.  EVER.  It’s like gaming is a social crutch, or his only identity.  That’s the issue I have with it, and why I don’t like gaming in general. This isn’t about me feeling like the game is stealing his time or replacing me- he does an great job of focusing on me and our relationship and giving me love etc. etc. etc… I wouldn’t mind if he were well rounded and did some gaming on the side, but as it is now gaming just seems like an immature way to connect to people. 
 Which is another issue for us: connection. He loves talking about his games. I don’t deeply understand them, nor do I really want to.  I know that sounds cold, but can’t force myself to like something. The most I can muster is indifference, which is better than the distaste I feel every time gaming is brought up. I think deep down I resent the games for “making” him immature/preventing him from having different interests. The things I love are exercise, nutrition, nature, drawing, and anything active and adventurous like canyoneering.  I’m a D1 athlete, and have a passion for sports and human performance/health and wellness. In fact, I’m aspiring to go to med school and become a doctor to help people achieve those things. I used to be able to talk to John about athletics. When we started dating, he was playing water polo. Then he quit at the beginning of sophomore year of college, and I felt like I lost a big connection with him. Looking back, I think that John playing sports mitigated the effects of him gaming; at least I was still dating an athlete. Now, it’s like we don’t have any common passions anymore. 
 That’s not to say the relationship is all bad! John is the most patient and understanding person I know, and he really balances out my tendency to get stressed and stubborn/impatient. We still do a lot of things together, like cook and go to the beach and explore new places and work out. We can still talk about other subjects. And, he treats me like an absolute princess (I’m talking an insane amount of affection and spoiling). I truly believe that he loves me unconditionally, which makes me feel even guiltier for not being able to support his passion. We are also very good at communication, are super sexually compatible, and have similar life goals- we want to live in the same place, have a family, etc. 
 I really love this boy, but there’s always been that nagging issue of video games. We did a good job of ignoring it for the most part, and I was somewhat relieved because for a time I thought he was going into another field based on his internship. But recently, he changed his major to multimedia with a focus on game design. When I asked, he said he wants to work in the gaming industry. SOS! What do I do now?! I’m so torn. On one hand, I know he should follow his passion and do what he wants to.  On the other hand, I’m not wrong for my personal viewpoints. One striking thing he texted me was “I didn’t really think it would be so much of an issue, I assumed when it came down to it you would just ignore my work.” 
 I don’t think one person ignoring or disliking their SO’s field of work is very healthy for a relationship. And frankly, the thought of it makes me sad. I don’t want to have tension every time I John ask about his day, or not be able to connect with his coworkers and friends. I guess I always hoped he would “grow out” of gaming, but apparently not.  I know when it comes down to it my decision is simple- stay with John or break up. I love John, and could always envision a life with him.  Also, if I’m being completely honest John comes from a much wealthier family than me and has given me a lot of opportunities I wouldn’t have on my own. I’m afraid of throwing away security, companionship, and someone who loves me like he does. And over what, video games!? We’re going to be talking about it soon to trying to come up with compromises, but I can’t think of any. 
 I guess after this whole monstrous post, I’m just looking for any opinions on my situation or suggestions on what to bring up in my conversation with John. Thank you for any and all advice! I’ll try to respond to questions.","I don’t like video games. My boyfriend does.  It’s now his major and aspiring line of work.

 My girlfriend hasn't had the easiest childhood. Her parents divorced when she was at a young age. Because of this she didn't really get to know her father.  Recently however, her father came back into her life.  She wants to get to know him better and his family (remarried with kids).

 The news that she wants to move down there has been incredibly hard for me to accept.  I want to marry this woman and never once pictured us apart. I want to try and make a LDR work because I want us to be together but I dont know how to adjust. 
 Me moving out there with her is impossible at this time. I have a daughter from a previous relationship that I would never think about leaving and my career is out here.

"My SO and I started dating August 2013. I lost my virginity to him when I was 16 and we've had casual sex a handful of times up until i was 17. The summer before we started dating was great and I had a good feeling about this. 
 In September I house sit for my friend and invite a few friends over. He asks if he can bring some girl named ""Fran"". I figure she is just a friend and say why not. Three months later while one day sleeping over his house I find emails of them exchanging nudes while he is asleep. I make one of them his wallpaper and immediately walk home at 3am(CHICAGO IN DECEMBER YALL) He comes over the next day and admits that a week after I met her when I house sat they got together and had sex. That week I went away to spend Xmas with my family, realized how much we missed each other and I forgave him. 
 A few months later, I'd say May 14, I find messages to Fran asking when he's gonna see her and what not. We work through it and work really hard to restore our trust. 
 Last week we spent Thanksgiving with each of our own families. I was at my Grandma's who lives on the other side of the city so I stayed the night. He calls me after work, 7pm, the next day and agrees to pick me up but says he has to call his sister and will call me back. He never calls me back. I start calling around 8 and he doesn't answer which is really sus. He calls me back an hour later and says he was sleeping and is really tired and will continue to sleep. He asks me if i'm going to spend the night and i tell him yes bc i have no other way home. He asks again before hanging up. 
 My brother ended up picking me up and taking me home. On my way I call my SO many times to let him know I got a ride but no answer. I get there and try to go into the room but the door is locked. I immediately knew someone was in there. He opens the door after shuffling around and stands in the doorway. My stomach is in knots. He is in his boxers and probably just threw on the shirt he was wearing. I push through and as soon as i do Fran emerges from hiding in the closet. I cannot believe it. THE SAME BITCH FROM ALWAYS! 
 I flip out internally but approach them calmly. I lock him out and ask her what was going on bc at this point her word meant more than his. She says that he started messaging her again a month ago and told her we had been broken up. The same thing he said to her a year ago when he cheated. I find out they made out but didn't have sex. My brother pulls me away from the situation and i go home with him. 
 So, my SO drops her off as soon as I leave bc he CHOSE to pick her up instead of me. I guess bc she was closer?? i mean wtf else?? :( 
 He apologizes daily and does many of the things he's been putting off that he said he'd do for me. We hang out a few days later and i can't help but forget what just happened. We've have sex twice and now I feel like shit. I love him so much and know he loves me too but I don't want him to forget what he just did to me. I know he knew he fucked up and I feel sorry for him. but can the trust be built again? Should I just walk away. Does he actually have an interest in this girl? Idk i'd really like to hear from you guys. 
 I never meant for this to be this long but it felt really good getting it out. Thanks friends.",BF cheated on me once at the start of our relationship. Forgave him.

"I had to move overseas to Asia when I was younger due to my parent's job and when i came back to the U.S., one of my cousins was introducing me to some girls and they asked where I lived and I said the country name and not a second later I said 'Yeah it's great living in Asia' and she literally asked me how I could live in two countries at the same time.

"I'm really just looking for confirmation that other folks have these days too.  I'm 26/F, he's 27/M.  And this weekend, every single thing he did aggravated the piss out of me.  Didn't do anything out of the ordinary, I didn't really have any reason to be annoyed, I just  was . 
 For example.  Yesterday morning, I wake up and he's pulling his work clothes out of his ""clean clothes pile"" on the floor and looking like he's slept in them for a week.  Instead of just shaking my head and ignoring it as pre usual, it really aggravated me.  I mean come on.  Is it that much trouble to take your clothes out of the dryer when they're done and hang them the fuck up?  You're a grown-ass person. 
 If I stand back objectively, I totally recognize that this (and other similar issues) are probably the source of my frustration.  Aggravation at a lack of perceived maturity/ability to take care of yourself/lack of care in regards to maintaining a professional work appearance.  Feeling embarassed  for  him, because I know he'll probably be judged by his coworkers and clients for the unprofessional appearance, and I know he's better than that.  Sort of a ""don't you judge him, you don't know him!"" feeling regarding others and a, ""don't you do that, don't you know that affects your professionalism?"" feeling towards him. 
 //End of armchair psych assessment. 
 Yeah, I know.  Communication is key and all that jazz.  And he and I have fantastic communication in general.  And he is a wonderful,  wonderful  man.  I recognize that.  He is good to me, and we're great together, and love the hell out of each other.  Things like today's aggravation I tend not to bring up because I feel it's way more my issue than it is anything on his end.  But there's still the problem of actually feeling annoyed towards him, and aggravated with his actions - even though they're pretty much the same as they always are.  They just happen to be pissing me off today. 
 What the heck do y'all do when you're having one of those days?  Say, ""Honey, I love you, but you're pissing me right the hell off today.""?  Just roll with it?  I ended up just giving him a heads up that I was in a shitty mood, and apologized if I was taking it out on him in any way, shape, or form.  But there's still this weird, transient aggravation bouncing around in the back of my brain, and I'm just not sure what to do with it.","My man is a wonderful person, and I love the hell out of him.

"Last week, I (female) hooked up with a friend of mine (male) (both of us are 23) that i've know for several years and have been hanging out with in a group with several times a week for at least a year or so. I've always been in a serious relationship but I recently became single so the idea of us being anything was never an option, plus our group is so close, the whole idea of it never really occured to us (or me at least). 
 All through out the night of our first hook up, we'd hook up and stop and say ""AAhh this is awkward!"" and basically just jump back on each other, the chemistry is there and obvious. We didn't end up having sex, just thinking it wasn't a good idea and I was very freshly out of a relationship. We are aquaintances with each others exes so that definitely was a factor to me. 
 After a group outing of going to a club and trying to keep our cool last night, I end up back at his place. (NONE of our friends know, and CANNOT know.) This time was a little more natural and we kind of accepted, THIS IS HAPPENING! 
 I drove him crazy enough to think sex was a good idea, we started and stopped again. It was too weird for him but he said he just needs to accept it's ME. But it's not too weird for him to have his face between my legs? For me.. sex is sex..if i'm attracted to you, thats all it is.

"Hey reddit, I've got a problem. I haven't actually 'hung out' with someone in over a year, and don't really have anyone to qualify as a 'friend'. Let me explain first. I've went out of state for high school, and did great there, met tons of people, had a fuckton of fun. Because it was out of state, a lot of people moved back, and went to other colleges. Now being in my first year (Fourth grouping of classes) of Community College (Fuck yeah discounted learning), I'm really starting to miss having people to actually talk to (I talk to some of them once in awhile, but have very little time to drive cross-state to see people). To explain, I used to have pretty bad social anxiety, and was pretty hefty. A little while after high school, I decided enough was enough, lost ~100lbs (Down to ~165), overcame my anxiety, did great in classes, got a job, etc.. So here I am, not exactly a pure eye-orgasm-machine, but I'd like to think I'm somewhat decent looking. I have no problem conversing with people on a various set of topics. I'd like to think I'm a pretty friendly person, and have no problem shooting the shit with customers/classmates/coworkers, and damn me if I can't make someone laugh. It's just that everyone seems to either know each other, or have a large group of friends anyway. How the fuck do I initiate the 'hanging out'? Usually I just assume people aren't interested, as I usually initiate the conversations 80% of the time. Am I missing a fuckton of social cue's? Considering my co-workers (And anyone else that sees me on a day to day basis), I present myself as happy, and don't really talk much about myself personally, so I can only imagine what they think.

"I need some perspective. I'm 29/f and my husband is 39/m. We have been married for almost 2 years, and we've been together for 5+ years. 
 Lately I keep noticing things about my husband that I wish he would change. These are things that didn't bother me very much before we got married but now seem impossible to ignore, and they bother me daily. For instance: 
 
 He's about 30 pounds overweight. I'm an avid runner and fitness enthusiast, and I'm becoming even more fit as I age (exercise has just become a hobby for me) — but my husband seems to be letting himself go. He's always been about 20 pounds overweight, but it seems to be getting worse. He will start exercising for several weeks, and then get busy with a project and stop exercising completely. 
 
 He interrupts people during conversations. Whenever we have guests over, he seems to talk over people in a friendly attempt to make conversation.  He doesn't interrupt me very often, and he's not an asshole or anything — he just doesn't have an awareness of what he's doing. 
 
 He's messy. This man is almost 40 years old and he has to be told to clean up after himself. We have a clear division of labor around the house — I am responsible for certain chores, he is responsible for others — but he rarely holds up his end of the bargain unless I pester him about it. If I didn't point out to him that the floors hadn't been swept in two weeks, he would probably never remember to sweep. He throws his dirty laundry on the floor instead of in the basket, and it will stay there for a long time. Occasionally, I feel like I'm his mother. 
 
 
 I have definitely talked to my husband about all these things (although, I haven't addressed his weight problem directly — I've only encouraged him to exercise and helped him make good food choices). Every time we discuss the cleaning or the interrupting, he says he'll try to do better, and then kind of never follows through. 
 My problem is this: I don't want to be a nagging wife who is constantly trying to get her husband to change who he is.  Truthfully, he has been like this for a while, but it never used to bother me very much. But as we are getting older and talking about having kids, these habits of his are driving me up the wall. I have secretly been wondering if I actually can spend the rest of my life hiding how much his habits bother me, and if maybe I should leave.  I don't think I ever could leave my husband for these things, but I would be lying if I said the thought hadn't been crossing my mind a lot lately. 
 On one hand, I feel like I married him knowing that he had these habits, and it would be unfair of me to ask him to change all these things. On the other hand, I feel like his habits have gotten  worse  the past few years, and he needs to be more responsible. 
 There are many things I  do  like about my husband, and I try to keep those things in mind. I try to focus on the positives — he's wonderful with our dog, he is devoted to me, he has supported me in times of need, and he is gentle, funny, and kind. However, the things I want him to change keep crossing my mind, and they are driving me up the wall. 
 Can other married people please give me some perspective here? Is it fair to bring these things up to my husband on a larger level (""hey, there are some things that are really bothering me and I'd like to ask you to make some changes"")? Or should I learn to live with these things, for the sake of honoring who he is as a person and not trying to change him?","Many of my husband's bad habits/flaws didn't used to bother me so much, but the longer we are together, the more they are driving me absolutely nuts.

Or is the problem really with me — and I need to figure out how to not be so bothered by his bad habits?",29,F,Marriage
"We've been together three years, and I can't think of a time where he(23m) hasn't wanted other women. I (22f)have been working towards being OK with an open relationship.
  Well three weeks ago, he cheated on me in a room not 10 feet from where I was asleep. He says that it has nothing to do with me, he did it because he wanted to and he was curious. He says I'm the one loves and wants forever he was just being stupid and it'll never happen again.
   I've made a lot of progress. Our sex life is back, we are happy most days and I can talk about it calmly. I've even made the ability to partner swap a thing.
   The other night we went out drinking and he hit on me. I don't really believe he wants me sometimes, more that I'm his only option for sex that doesn't lose me. I believe this because he's been so willing to hurt me over and over to get other women. When he saw that, he said that he feels like its useless to try and fix things, that there's no improvement and that he feels like giving up, I told him that there had been progress and that he can't expect everything to be OK right of the bat. That my trust for him is broken and my self esteem is pretty low. He just told me that they shouldn't be.

"Hey guys, I'm 20 and home for christmas break. Since none of my college friends are here I've kinda been hanging out with these trashy friends who live in my hometown. 
 Monday they decided to do molly, they had a huge bag of it. It looked like little crystal rocks. Apparently we would swallow .2 every hour to 3. We started at 8 that night and ended at 6 in the afternoon the next day. All we did was do molly. The night i drank a good bit water, but the next day we were rolling...not so much. 
 Well after those 2 days i had some side effects. I couldn't have erections and I couldn't pee right. it took me 14 hours to pee the first time those 2 nights. 
 Those side effects are gone, however i kept biting my bottom lip while i was rolling. after the molly nights it was really swolen and red. I had iced it and washed my mouth with salt water and then mouth wash to clean it out. the next day part my lip was yellow. it seems like it turns yellow in the morning. I'll upload a pic of it later 
 Another issue i'm having is that my fucked up lips are incredibly dry and chapped. i keep drinking water since wednesday but still no hydration in my lips. i can't eat correctly since i can't open my mouth enough to not cut myself due to the chapped. 
 My mentality is also different. I feel like I'm not all the way back. If i zone out and think of me in some sort of scenario I completely put myself in it. Like i'll actually talk aloud as if i'm really in that scenario (not loud enough where another person can hear, more like whispering) 
 Another issue is the depression. I've been feeling depressed ever since I rolled hard on monday. I went through a breakup this summer before i moved out for college. But now that I'm back in my hometown where we dated and this surprise depression is coming out i can't think of anything but her. i'm pretty sure its the molly aftereffect since we been broken up for like 6-7 months and i've come back home before. I hope i'm not putting too many unnecessary details in this post, i just want to give all the info to help you guys understand. 
 Finally, what should I do? I'm honestly not going to try molly anymore. This was kind of a bad experience for me, but it was stupid to do that much for my first time. I honestly had thought molly was like weed where you can just keep going. 
 Also another question, is it fine to drink/smoke trees/ciggs or not? Just in case i get into a situation like that","Depression over an ex, super dry and chappy lips, mentality has dropped a good bit. Can anyone help and explain what i should do?

"Almost a year ago, I went to visit my good friend who was away at school. There was a big party and I met this girl, and we hit it off. The only thing is, one of my best friends also hit it off with her. He had just gotten out of a really shitty relationship, and as much as I liked this girl, I let him have this one. 
 Fast-forward to about a month ago. I'm jobless and my dad is a dick, so he waited until I got laid off to kick me out. So now, I'm homeless and jobless at 22. Guess who takes me in? My friend and his girlfriend. 
 Now, I knew they were having issues, but I had no idea how fucked up and abusive my friend was being. He constantly treats her like she's second class, puts her down, completely disregards anything she has to say and when she sticks up for herself or argues back he has no problem getting physical. I would've never expected this type of bullshit from him, and he's never even come close to treating another human being like this, let alone a girlfriend 
 The worst part is, this girl is absolutely amazing. She has the sweetest smile and is probably the most kind, caring person in the fucking world.

"I'll try to keep the history brief, but I think it's relevant to where I am now. So here it goes: 
 Got married at 24 to a woman 8 years my senior. About a year later, had a child. Separated several months after that, Divorce. Drama. Misery. 
 Dated a few girls after that. One was for a year and a half, I think. Didn't work out. A few one night stands. Then dated, and ended up moving in with another girl. Stayed together for about 3 years, then had to cut it off because things weren't working out, for many reasons.

"Hi Fittit. So I am a mostly sedentary guy, 5'8"" 145, always been skinny and it's hard for me to gain or lose weight.

We are both in our mid twenties and have been sharing an apatment in a new city for almost a year now.

In this time I grew up a fair bit, graduated from University, and met a great new group of friends. In other words I improved my day to day lfe drastically. I decided to move to live with him because I hoped that when I saw him again the love would come back and everything would be fine.

"First things first: I'm a 19 year old caucasian female.  Northern European descent so quite pale- I burn easily.  I live in the midwestern US but received the burn while in Trinidad.  I have no other medical conditions, and don't take any medications besides birth control pills. 
 Now on to the story.  So I've always burned easily, as I'm quite pale, and have always lived somewhere pretty cold and overcast so I don't have a lot of exposure to sun 9 months out of the year.  Everyone in my family burns easily like me so we're always careful during the summer months to wear sufficient clothing and to use sunscreen properly.  Despite this, I probably get a mild sunburn once or twice each year.  But this time, it was the worst it's ever been.  I was on a spring break trip to Trinidad with some friends and I was by far the palest one.  For the first few days I was careful to wear light but covering clothing, and to be careful about sunscreen- but soon jealousy kicked in, and I got a little cocky, so I decided to wear a bikini to ""fit in"" (I typically wear a rash guard over it).  I probably was only directly exposed to the sun for 15 minutes but wound up getting the worst burn of my life.  The skin on my back was peeling and blistered all over.  I felt nauseous and shaky, I couldn't sleep comfortably, or even shower or change my shirt for three days.  It basically ruined the last half of my trip. 
 I did everything right and I'm proud to say that, a week later, it's about 90% healed over without any infection but probably some scarring once all the dead skin flakes off.  But, everyone I've talked to says I should probably get a melanoma test in a while once this is healed over.  Mind you none of them are medical professionals, but, since my mother had to have something cancerous removed from her skin at 37 (though she never needed chemo/radiation) I am a little paranoid. What do I do?","Very pale girl got jealous of her less pale friends while in Trinidad, got cocky and didn't re-apply sunscreen or wear proper clothing.

 edit: for clarification, I wore sunscreen but I put it on too soon before getting into water and never-reapplied it until I noticed my skin getting a little red.  Because of the location of the burn it's a little hard to take a photo but if absolutely necessary I'll put one up.",19,F,AskDocs

 I read lots of threads about this topic and I've made a list of things that could be the cause of my dating difficulties. I'm a very honest girl so I won't sugar coat anything: 1.) I am overweight, not morbidly, but I am. I do have an hourglass figure but I could stand to lose 20-30 pounds and to tone, most definitely // 2.) I am extremely open and honest; I have trouble being coy and playing the cat and mouse game because I hate feeling like women have to mentally coax men into liking them without just being verbal and upfront about it; whenever I am interested in a man, I take my time to get to know him on a private level by observing him without making a big deal out of it, if after that time passes and he seems like a cool person then I have no problem initiating and asking him to hang out (I never force the word ""date"") // 3.) I prefer communication in the real world instead of through text. This hasn't ever really posed a problem to me because all the guys whom I've been interested in take ages to respond, and I do, as well. But I don't obsess over the texting stuff; I'm actually offended when more of the conversations happen virtually instead of face to face. // 4.) I'm seen mostly in work out clothes or jeans because I'm either at the gym or running late to school or on my way to work and I don't really look too deeply into my wardrobe when I'm asking a guy out. // 5.) I have silky curly textured hair (I'm black) and I usually wear my hair in a bun because I'm always on the go, I don't leave the house looking crazy but I don't make a fuss about my looks when I'm on my way to school or the gym (which is like...every day). 
 I think all of these reasons I mentioned could be good and bad contributors to my love life. I am working on my weight with dieting and exercise, but I know its going to be a long road until I reach my body goals. I do think I have good confidence, but only in my personality, not my looks. I don't down myself but at the same time I am very honest with where I would like to improve. 
 I tend to go after guys who have displayed their passions/dreams/life goals to me. I'm easily attracted to goofy guys with great senses of humor, or odd talents/hobbies, or eclectic tastes in poetry. 
 Part of me believes I should transform my body to my ideal, and then begin dating again. But another part of me feels like I shouldn't have to wait until I'm a size 8 in order to find a nice guy, and that whoever I meet should like me for who I am, even as I better myself. 
 I get tons of rejections before I can even go on a first date with most of these guys, which is why I'm here because I feel like I've only ever received clear, level-headed, non-cliched advice from reddit. All of these rejections do have an impact on my self-esteem because I automatically think that I'm physically unappealing and sometimes I DO think in my head ""if only I had this (insert ideal female body part)..."" 
 I'm very sure of my personality, I think I'm kind, funny, honest, and hard working. I feel like I'm very happy and I always keep myself busy. 
 I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, and why I get so many rejections. But I'd love some advice and insight as to what to do and how to talk to guys in a sexy and chill way.",I'm 22 and I get a lot of rejections from guys. I'd like some advice on how to be more appealing so that I can be noticed/get asked out more/ receive less rejections.,22,F,relationships
"Let me preface this by saying that I'm a Senior in High School and I have next to no knowledge on how seduction works. Please no ""It's just highschool"".  Anyway.  I run on the Track and XC teams and there is this girl on the team who catches my eye, let's call her Betty. She's smart, athletic, quite possibly the only girl who didn't evoke primarily a sexual attraction from me. I also noticed that she seemed to like me as well but I'm bad at subtle hints. Recently, the team created posters for the Seniors who did Cross Country, myself included. Fast forward a bit and I pick up my Senior poster to find that Betty has written  ""I'm going to miss you so much! Call me ;) ###-###-####"" . This scared and simultaneously excited the hell out of me. Fast forward 3 weeks (I didn't call because I didn't have a phone at the time. The number  is  hers though.) and a male teammate tells me that another male teammate wrote it as a joke. I'll update with a screenshot of what I texted her when I was under the impression  she  wrote it.

"Hi, I'm a 24yr old female who has been doing Stronglifts for about 4 months now. Things have been going really well, particularly my squats and accessory lower body lifts. 
 However, on and off over the past 1.5 months maybe, i seem to be experience a strange snapping/cracking sensation near my right shoulder blade (like a line of snapping muscle, probably about 5-8cm long from the feel of it). It only seems to happen sometimes when I'm either deadlifting or overhead pressing... I've worked hard on making sure my form is up to scratch, but it hasn't really gone away and still happens every few workouts. It'll just snap for a second (either when I'm coming down on a press, or going up/down on deadlifts)... there's  no  pain though, which is confusing me. 
 At the same time, it feels like the line of muscle that is snapping has gotten a bit longer (it happened again during tonight's workout, which is why I'm concerned). 
 I'm starting to think I should see a doctor, but it's just odd to have a muscle seeming like it's snapping without any pain accompanying it. 
 Has anyone ever experienced this, or have any advice on what I might be able to do? I don't really wan't to cut down the weight dramatically, or stop pressing/deadlifting for a month in the hope that it goes away... but I'm prepared to do whatever I need to in order to prevent injury. 
 Thanks very much :)","Muscle near shoulder blade keeps making a popping/snapping sensation when I OP or DL - no pain. What kind of injury/issue?

"My mother is a sweetheart, but there is one instance that I will never get over.  My appendix burst when I was about 11 or 12.  The doctor had to leave this big incision open, with one suture in the center.  The wound would then be stuffed with gauze to soak up this brown, infected fluid.  After a few weeks, I graduated from having a hole in my stomach stuffed with gauze, to just having a patch over it, and needing daily flushings with saline. 
 So, I'm scheduled to go to summer camp.  I loved summer camp, and insisted on going.  The doctor said it was cool, met with the camp nurse, and everything was set up.  So, I get to camp, and go for my first meeting with the nurse.  It was obvious from the beginning that she didn't know what she was doing.  She was supposed to shove a tube into the incision, and actually clean the hole.  One purpose of doing it this way was to keep the incision open.  The doctor made it very clear that it was not to close up.  Basically, the nurse shot some saline on the outside, and that was that.  I didn't care, because I was young and bombproof. 
 Sooooo, halfway through the week, I have to go meet with my doctor.  Guess what...the wound had started to close up, and I would have to go back to get it re-opened.  He must have called the nurse to give her shit, because somewhere in all this my next appointment was cancelled, and I was told that the nurse was going to handle it.  I don't know if she said she'd do it in order to redeem herself, or what.  But, even at a young age, I knew this was not a good idea. 
 Picture this:  the nurse's office is some old cabin in the woods.  She looks like a lunch lady on You Can't Do That On Television, and has little dogs running around.  I told her that I wanted to call my mom.  I beg and plead, and my mother still insists that I let the nurse cut me open.  So, the only thing I can think of saying is ""She doesn't even have sterile gloves.""  My mother said she'd talk to the doctor, and I thought it was settled. 
 So, now I'm back in the nurse's office later on.  She comes out, makes some snotty comment about how I complained about her not having sterile gloves, and presents to me a package of sterile gloves and some crazy torture device in a plastic bag.  This thing looked like the razor tip off of a hunting arrow.  She tells me that it's the probe that will be stuck into my now-closed incision, and then cut the shit back open.  I was to come back later to meet my doom. 
 There was only one day left to camp, so I did the only reasonable thing.  My buddy and I spent the day hiding in the woods.  I still bring it up, and she still thinks she did nothing wrong.",My mother thought it would be okay to let some trollish summer camp nurse slice open my abdomen with a medieval torture device.,12,M,AskReddit
"I don't know where to begin. I'm 35 and married, no kids. Wife is also 35. My wife's sister, whom we'll call Stephanie, is often over at our house with her husband. I didn't mean to, but I always found myself staring at Stephanie and being extremely attracted to her. I really couldn't help it. I'm devoted to my wife, but Stephanie looks just like my wife did a decade ago, so how was I not supposed to be attracted to her? Besides that, Stephanie and her husband like to come over and use our pool and all those times of seeing her in her bikini didn't help. 
 Well today I royally fucked up and now our whole extended family is probably going to implode. 
 Stephanie and her husband are putting in some fancy new shower and tub. They only have one bathroom and they could be without theirs for a week or two. Well, Stephanie called today and asked if she could pop over and take a shower. 
 I don't know what came over me. Something about the thought of her being naked, right here, almost close enough to see, just sent me into overdrive. I'm not trying to make excuses, but I honestly don't think I've ever been that horny. It really clouded my judgement and if I had just went off and jerked off or something I know I never would've done what I did next. 
 I have this motion-activated pen camera. Records on a mini memory card. Looks just like a normal pen except for one little dot where the lens is that you'd never really notice. I don't have it for any nefarious reasons. I bought it several months back when I was dealing with a situation at my work where I needed to protect myself legally. 
 Well, my dumb ass ran and got that pen and planted it in the bathroom before Stephanie came over. She arrived, and I puttered around in the garage while she showered. Honestly, I wasn't even nervous, just excited. I really didn't even consider the idea that I'd get caught. She finished showering, I assume told my wife bye, and I saw her leave from inside the garage. 
 Well, when I went and retrieved the pen and downloaded the video a little later, I was in for a horrible surprise. 
 The video showed Stephanie come in, undress, shower, the normal stuff. After a few minutes, she got out and started doing the weird naked lotion rituals that women all seem to do. 
 That's when she stopped mid-lotioning and stared intently at the camera for several seconds. You can imagine my reaction when watching it. I went from being more horny than I've ever been in my life and excited at finally seeing the object of my lust naked to feeling like I was going to throw up. I knew what I was seeing, but I didn't believe it. But then Stephanie reached out and picked up the pen and brought it in close to her face and I knew I was completely fucked. She stared at it for several seconds and it was obvious from her shocked expression that she knew what it was and then she quickly put it back down with the camera pointing down and the rest of the video was just blackness. 
 I don't know how she noticed it. The only thing I can figure is that my wife must have told her about the pen at some point and told her about my work situation. Maybe she even showed it to her. You'd never suspect in a million years that this pen had a camera in it, though, even if you picked it up. So somehow she knew about it. 
 And now, hours later, I'm sitting here in hell waiting for the other shoe to drop and feeling sick. This will destroy my extended family. My wife, I have no idea what she'll do. I don't  think  she'd leave me over simply peeking at someone naked, but if the fallout with her family is bad enough she might. 
 The waiting is killing me. I know it's coming. I assume Stephanie hasn't seen her husband yet tonight (he works late) or he'd be over here trying to kick my ass right now. He's a big jealous guy and not the type to let this sort of thing slide AT ALL. 
 Should I just preemptively tell my wife and beg for mercy? Should I try to talk to Stephanie and beg her not to say anything? I have no idea what to do. I just want to crawl in a hole and die. I wish I had a time machine.",Got super horny and planted a spy cam to check out my sister-in-law naked. She found it. I'm fucked and waiting and don't know what to do next.,35,M,relationships
"A PSA ABOUT INTERNET SAFETY 
 Ok, let me just make a disclaimer from the start that I'm a really pissed right not so sorry if this sounds super angry, I think it needs to be said. 
 Sometimes on mua we forget about the dangers of posting on the Internet, or at least I do. Mua is definitely one of the kindest and most friendly subreddits, but there are consequences to posting your face on here. 
 Tonight I was informed that my picture had been used in a rateme thread, where some fucking scumbag took it upon themselves to create a fucking album of pictures of me, pretending to be an 18 year old girl looking for a rate. 
 So first of all fuck them. 
 Second of all this is partially my fault. And I'm honestly most angry with myself right now because I fully knew the dangers of posting my face, and the fact that some of my posts have over 20,000 views should have a been a sign to me to take them down. 
 But now just because I wanted to show off my fucking makeup I'm sitting here crying while having to read the 20 or so comments telling me that I'm fat. And to be honest I could care less about what they say, because a baby face was one of the perks I get as a fifteen year old girl. And while I'm on that note I'M 15 YEARS OLD WHO THE FUCK TRIES TO GET RATE MES ON SOME 15 YEAR OLD'S PICTURES LIKE GET A FUCKING LIFE. That sounded really angry sorry this whole thing just ruined my night. 
 To be completely honest this isn't the worst thing in the world and will get over it, but it's still a really shitty thing to do and it took a big toll on my self-esteem. 
 At this point there isn't really much I can do because the damage has been done and I don't think I can get it taken down. 
 Ok end rant. 
 The point is please be aware of posting your face, and do not ever post anything that you would be worried about resurfacing. I've heard a few people talk about this happening to them but for some reason I thought I was some how immune from this I guess, but it really can happen to everyone. 
 The worst part about this is that I'm considering not making any more posts on here because this scared the crap out of me and it just really sucks. 
 I'm not trying to scare anyone out of posting just a warning to make sure whatever you post is something that you wouldn't necessarily care if it resurfaced. 
 Ok have a good night guys love you all; be safe. 
 P.S. Sorry this isn't directly makeup related I wasn't sure where to post this.","someone posted my photos on a rateme thread pretending to be me please be careful with what you post on the Internet. 
 EDIT:
Hi guys its about 2:30 AM right now and I have school tomorrow, but I can't sleep. I really want to thank everyone for being so kind about this whole situation and helping me get both the imgur album and the rate me thread taken down; I don't know if you guys really know how much it means to me, but I'm SOOO thankful to have it down. 
 Also I just wanted to clarify things: 
 By making this post I had no intention of scaring anyone, but I wanted to make sure everyone who posts here knows the risks. That being said this is a lovely community and I really want as many people as possible to participate in it. 
 Also I made this post to make a warning about being safe, not to look for pity. You guys don't have to worry about me, ok? 
 Also for the time being I have put most of my old posts, on private in the imgur album (and deleted some posts entirely), because I'm honesty very uncomfortable with the situation right now, and I'm still very unsure if I will ever post my face again. This has been a rather traumatizing experience. But the tutorials will for now remain on my blog. 
 I would also like to mention the people who PM'ed me from the rate me threads, although not all of them were very kind I do want to praise those who had apologized for the rate thread.
I'm going to try to sleep now, but I'll try to reply to comments and PMs tomorrow

"So we've been friends since December. We're really tight, we hung out a couple times, we talk every day,  and we have a bunch a stuff in common. I was gonna ask her to be my girlfriend in mid January but i felt it was too soon. I was then gonna tell her about 3 weeks ago when she randomly told me about her crush. It's some dude in her speech class. She's liked him for a while now and just started talking to him. I feel crushed.

1-just tell her how i feel and see what happens

"So long story short, I went to private school on student loans and then didn't get a proper job for a few years.  Ended up with $199,566 in debt, settled half of it through lump sum, and am currently sitting on less than $17,000 in the hole. I think I accrue about $12 a month in interest, nothing too crazy. 
 I went through the Dave Ramsey FPU and have managed to get super into budgeting and cutting expenses out of my life to get into this position.  I was sort of in a traumatic financial place and had to make some serious shifts in my processes to actually pay off this debt, and now I'm becoming a bit of a slave to the new process. 
 I'm looking at buying a house in early 2016 once I have 20% saved up with my wife. We're looking at houses that are affordable for our income, and saving the 20% to sort of help affirm and limit our options so that we don't go off the deep end when making this financial decision. However, I'm kind of obsessive about not going into debt at this point and would feel less anxious buying a cheaper home. I would feel in more control if I knew we could live in something that lacks character and pride that we could pay off in 10 years, then we could start the process over, save up another 20% etc or look at selling the house to invest in a bigger space or something closer to ""the dream home"". 
 Most homeowners I know love their house, but have an endless list of ""I wish we would have done X differently"" and I'm just pretty anxious about making those mistakes.  I'm terrified of a 30 year mortgage. I have very little need for security and structure and so investing in a house is not natural to me as a high value commodity, so having a boring house would be ok. (I grew up in a trailer lol). 
 So anyway, I know a percentage of this conversation belongs in /r/relationships as most financial matters do, but mostly I'm just looking for some advice and affirmation about what buying a house looks like.  If I can afford 20% down payment and if we can meet the monthly expenses with plenty of room for savings, is it financially sound to own a nice house?  Or is it a luxury that people feel they owe themselves?  I'm thinking in this day and age your dream house at 30 years of age is not as realistic as we think it is. So I'm just looking for some insight from financial folks to see your thoughts on the matter.","As a first time home buyer recovering from significant debt, I am considering buying a ""boring"" budget house, opposed to the ""dream"" house that my wife and I can afford.

"Yup, happened to me (33, f) twice out of the five times I drank Ayahuasca during cermonies. One time I actually fell to one knee, and blacked out for a moment while walking to the toilet. The other time I half fainted while on the toilet :) 
 I think for me it was a combination of low blood sugar and the lowering of my blood pressure. Also I learned that because of the deep mental process I go into I kindof lose touch with my physical energyfield and that's when I stop breathing properly. Couldn't really walk on my own either due to this. Well..I could walk with the help of a shaman that was there to assist the participants but I felt a little retarded because I couldn't place my feet in the correct way (one foot in front of the other..nope, couldn't manage it) hehe ;) I felt like a foal that was just born..it made me laugh :p 
 Both times deep breathing and thus finding my centre again helped. I focussed on my belly and my feet while breathing. Also rubbing my calves and feet helped. After that I was feeling cold and shakey but was ok. After about 20 minutes I was fine again. Both times felt like a tipping point in the ceremony so I think my body then levels out the bloodsugar and the bloodpressure and I continue my process. At least, that's how things worked for me those times. Now I know I can expect this to happen so I have my breathing techniques at the ready and it doesn't scare me that much anymore.","Yup, I (33, f) almost fainted twice, deep breathing helped me, was fine and could continue my processingwork after about 20 minutes both times.",33,f,Ayahuasca
"I attempted suicide about 9 months ago. (July 12, 2011). I reached the lowest of low in life(or so I thought). Things obviously didn't work out because I'm still here.

 One of my best friends (19F) and I (19M) have known each other for about four years now. We are and have been very close for the majority of this time, and, over the past couple years, have had some romantic flings that ultimately sizzled out.

"Excuse the wall of text, this is going to be a long, drawn-out tale.  I'm a 23 year old female who has a problem staying interested in guys who are genuinely nice and compatible with me on paper.  I always find myself attracted to men who are either uninterested, unavailable, or unattainable.  I can't just will myself to place this attraction on guys I could actually have a feasible relationship with. 
 I think it comes from having moved around so much in the past year and having awful experiences in relationships.  Here's a quick rundown: For the past year, I've had a few flings with guys- one had a girlfriend, one wasn't over his ex (we had been close friends for over four years, we started to fall in love, and then he wasn't there for me when I was sexually assaulted), one was in another country (I briefly lived abroad and met someone, we don't talk anymore- he was someone I wasn't supposed to date because of his position in the college), and now I think there is potential for something to happen with my boss.  I'm extremely attracted to him but I don't know if I am ready for the consequences. 
 I have tried meeting other people and to see the best in them, but I just have these blinders on that make me only interested in him at the moment.

"Ok Reddit, I never thought I would tell my story, but I am at this place and need to get out of it ASAP. 
Why r/Entrepreneur? because I am afraid if I ever go back to corporate this will end very very badly for me. 
 After a life in Academy, in which I had the fun of my life but also got so frustrated i started to spit blood, I moved to another life in corporate Enterprise. This had its perks, but mostly very stressful and depressing. 
 Now reaching 40, and I engineered myself to be fired - it was either that or I would blow a fuse. At the same time I got a family to feed, live in a foreign country (to me and family - moved here for the job), and have about zero savings. 
 So the immediate move was to create some websites for immediate income to allow me to concentrate on more interesting projects that would allow a decent living. 
 Created first website as a blog/niche Tshirt thing, which was quite successful - a few thousands visits within the first week. But I killed it immediately upon seeing that I would never be able to monetize it. 
 Created a second website publishing stupid pictures. Got banned from r/pics after one day and 10K visitors and that was the end of it. Actually that was more an experience than anything else. I hate stupid pictures. 
 So with my newfound knowledge of internet and wordpress, I set up to do my third site. I am not a coder, have no understanding whatsoever about internet technologies (yea, a dinosaur, but not yet extinct!). Tried fiverr, tried microlancer, tried Odesk. Most of it are a bunch of scammers. So after a few 100$ less I sat to do it myself. 
 Internet is your friend they say, well it is also your enemy. A time burner as I have ever seen one. too much info, too little time. and for a non-coder like me, ever trial and error is another battle. But I think I won: 
 I made this site, live now for 10 days: **[Peekmaster.com]( 
 reception is ok, not great. monetization is Amazon, conversion is negligible. This idea was just: let's make enough money to go by the next month until I can make something that brings real money. 
 However, it turns out the most difficult is to get some following. I don't understand facebook, get no income, and my funds are dwindling fast.

"Hi /r/fitness. (If this is in the wrong subreddit please tell me) 
 I've searched high and low for a good answer to this but I can't find one, so I'll explain my situation. 
 I (24/m) currently weigh 350lbs (trying to drop weight, it's working slowly) and I've started the couch to 5k workout mixed with swimming, so far that's going great...on days I don't work. I work a 7day in a row (12h/day) job where I don't have time to exercise when I get up at 5am and only have about 30 minutes of free time after doing all of my regular post work (with travel I get home between 9-930pm) duties (shower, prepare lunch/dinner for work the next day). I haven't been able to find a light workout to fit in that time span. I've tried going for a jog as soon as I get home but I find after showering I'm still a bit too worked up to sleep properly.

"I'm 25 and I have recently come out as gay. I began dating and sleeping with guys about a year ago. I'm glad that I finally accepted my sexuality and that I'm putting myself out there, but I find myself dealing with strange feelings and emotions that most people first experience 10 years earlier 
 It was all fun and games at first- grindr hookups with forgettable guys and I was content with that. Then I met the first guy that I really felt attracted to on a deeper level. After texting back and forth we finally agreed to meet up for dinner at a chinese place and it was great. We had a lot in common and I felt like we kinda clicked. The only problem was we were both leaving town for a month a few days later. I left to visit relatives and I honestly sort of forgot about him for a while. Then he texted me about a week later and we kept in contact almost every day after that. 
 We both came back into town and decided to meet up. We spent the whole day together (park, concert and dinner) and it was great. That night we hooked up at my place (also fun) but as soon as we were done something changed. He instantly became more distant and I got the feeling he  quickly lost interest. After that things just weren't the same. He kept in contact much less often and when he did, I could tell the enthusiasm was gone. 
 This really got to me and I fell into a deep depression, not only about the feelings he didn't have for me, but about my own insecurities. I began to feel inferior to him, and I became convinced that his life was better than mine in every way and always will be. Some days I could barely get out of bed. 
 Thankfully, I'm doing better now. The depression has lifted and I'm moving on with my life. I'm dating other guys (no one special yet) and focusing on other career goals . I still think about him a lot though. I continue to compare my life to his and often wonder what he's up to. Occasionally I fantasize about him coming into my life again. I realized this was unhealthy so I unfollowed him on fb. 
 How can I once and for all accept the fact that he's out of my life, and more importantly, be ok with it?? I feel so ill equipped to deal with this. I'm mature and experienced and competent in almost every other aspect of my life, except when it comes to dating and relationships, and it's because it's all so new to me. I want to learn from this experience, but I also don't want it to make me jaded. Just looking for some advice.","I'm recently out and for the first time I fell for a guy who seemed to lose interest in me.

"You can't even make this shit up. This is probably my first SERIOUS relationship and my (ex, now I guess) girlfriends relationship too. 
 A little background. I'm 17 (like the flair says!) and she's 16.
On Saturday I was out with a close friend (who's a girl) for a birthday dinner. It wasn't just me and her, it was with other mutual friends too. 
 My girlfriend came later. Anyway not to reveal too much personal information, I got upset at something she did and I just left. Left before the dinner started. 
 This is Saturday (4/20) . When I got home (after walking around by myself) I told her I wanted a break. I was just upset by her behavior. We've broken up 3-4 times before (mainly initiated by me). I know that's a red flag on me. 
 This part of Saturday I didn't know until Tuesday (4/23) because she told me (yea I'll explain that later on) but apparently while this was happening (I'm guessing AFTER I told her I wanted a break and shit) she kissed (or was kissed by - who cares it's the same thing) by a good friend of hers. We'll call him Randy (not his real name). 
 Now a little back story (I know this is getting confusing) - Randy and my ex-girlfriend actually dated last summer. But my ex-girlfriend broke it off - they didn't even last a month together. However they were still good friends after that. 
 I always had a problem with Randy because my exgirlfriend and Randy lived really close, and she would often run to him if we had any problems together - and go over to his house often. 
 On Saturday / Sunday I really didn't realize WTF I did, but I really wanted her back. But she seemed to have  moved on  (not really though, and that'll be explained below). She actually said before the LAST time we ""broke up"" that if I do something like this she'll leave me. No more chances, etc. I wasn't really THINKING as you can see from the stupid shit above but yea. 
 On Monday and Tuesday I begged (for the lack of a better word.. plus yea I practically did) for her back. However now she said that she had feelings for Randy. That basically at that moment she had to decide between someone she ""liked"" and someone she loved. I talked to her one last time, and honestly I was expecting the worst - I just talked to pour my heart out and tell her how I was feeling. 
 It's Tuesday now. 
 She chose me over Randy. 
 She came over to my house. It was like any other day when we were together. We did intimate things and acted like nothing ever really happened. In other words it was a great day. 
 She told me how she told other people she had no more feelings for me. But Joey (Randy's best friend) knew she was bullshiting. She told me she was lying to them to make herself look strong. 
 Around 9-10ish I walked her to the bus stop (she lives too far to be walked home) because she had to go home. On our way walking to the bus stop she told me how she couldn't even look at Randy in the face and that kissing him wasn't the same and all that crap - basically trying to make me feel better about her actions on Saturday. 
 -Sorry this is so long, but it's coming to an end- 
 I came back home and went on Facebook. blah blah blah. We're talking on Facebook and she suddenly sends me a Facebook message:  (red is her. black is me) 
 We were LITERALLY together from 3 PM ~ 10 PM. 
 So here I am. It's Wednesday (4/24) now. I didn't go to school today because I honestly didn't feel like doing anything. 
 I tried to reason with her, because we promised while we were walking to make this work and not make me do stupid shit (and vice versa). I talked with her best friend and Joey (Joey is basically Randy's best friend). I asked Joey why is she doing this/what's wrong with her. 
 I found out that Randy was drinking on Tuesday (4/23) - when she broke up with me. I don't really know what happened but since they live so close, it wouldn't be a surprise if she went over his house (he wasn't alone in his house, he has friends over a lot of times) to take care of him. 
 WTF am I suppose to do? Like.. this has to be the biggest mind fuck ever. Oh I realize I didn't mention it. We've been in a relationship for 7 months. 
 I talked to her last around 12 AM and she told me how she doesn't love either of us (me or Randy). That she's ""made her decision to be by herself. To be happy alone. To learn to do these things myself"". 
 She said she wasn't loving herself. She said she wasn't happy, and that her happiness depended all on me. She said she was dependent on me. 
 What am I suppose to do? Well honestly I don't have a choice but to leave her alone. I'm just really upset over this. I really did love her. I'm sorry for sounding gross but.. yea. 
 I don't really have much friends to talk to so I wanted to get this off my chest.. get some opinions.. etc.. Thanks for reading.","I don't blame you):

"24/M here, diagnosed a few months back but definitely showed signs since I was 6. You want to see a psychologist, they do not have the ability to prescribe medications (that's the difference between a psychologist and psychiatrist). I've been on medication and been off it. I was pretty closed minded about medication and reluctant to try, but I found it works. I just recently finished my bachelor's of computer engineering, and the medication certainly helped in my last semester. 
 That being said, I've gone many years without medication and still see it as a crutch. Most of the comments here are pretty good. Exercise is definitely something that provided a substantial boost in staying focused. Currently, I'm rather out of shape and have noticed that my ability to focus has dwindled. Without medication, your best bet to stay on track is to get a concrete schedule and routine going. For me, I noticed that I work best in the late morning and early afternoon and I  had to  take advantage of it.

"Edit: Wow, my first day of reddit and I got on the front page! Thanks guys! 
 Edit Dos: Thanks so much for gold! 
 So I'm a 26 year old male, married, and I have a wonderful 2 year old. Now because of the current living conditions, I generally don't have time to masturbate very much. 
 So I'm sitting in our bedroom, when I get a text from my wife, saying that she'll be a little late coming from the store (keep in mind the baby is with her)  This is your chance! Do it now!  my horny brain thought.
So I then drop my pants and commence the act. 
 Now if you're a male reading this, you'll know that when you're horny you don't really think too clearly, as while doing this I was right in front of our window. 
 As I keep going, I keep seeing a flashing light around my chest area. I then look up, only to see our Catholic neighbor staring in horror in her car. I assumed she'd drive off and pretend nothing happened, but  noooo . She started getting out of her car. 
 I then rushed to the bathroom, as she kept ringing the doorbell. I was scared. I've never felt a more petrifying feeling in my life. The blood was pounding in my ears, I knew I had to do something. 
 I then sat on the bathroom floor, and wondered what the fuck I'm doing with my life. Eventually, she decided to leave. 
 The poor lady was just bringing me apples, and I think I scarred her for life. 
 My wife has no clue what happened, and I hope it stays that way. I'm planning on apologizing tomorrow, and will update when I do.","Masturbated in front of catholic neighbor, rewarded with apples",26,M,tifu
"I'm sure this is supposed to be more along the lines of ghost stuff, but I'm going to tell you about the most scared I've ever been in my life.
Last year a friend of mine passed away, we'll call him Charlie. I'm in the Army and he had taken some frag to the leg in Iraq, but he pulled through so it came out of nowhere.. His death was a bit of a personal matter, but all you guys need to know is that my other friend, who I'll call Bill, took it very hard.
This guy Bill has been my best friend in the military. He's that guy who everyone wants to hang around, a perfect blend of friendliness and confidence. He knows what is important, what isn't, and most of all he truly cares for people. Everyone who reads this will know the type of person I'm talking about. Anyhow he's my best friend I've ever had, bar none.
So a week or so later, Charlie's family fly out to the nearby town, and we all decide to have a bit of a memorial. I'm not yet 21 at this point so I get to play the DD. My buddy Bill is hitting the bottle hard, doing shots with everyone, downing pitchers left and right. As the night goes on he seems to get more and more serious until about 1 am.
Bill walks up to me and says ""Hey, come outside with me while I smoke."" We both go out, he sits on a concrete block out in the parking lot and stares at the ground for a while. Then he say's the scariest thing I've ever heard someone say. 
 ""dgatos, after I go home tonight, I'm going to kill myself."" 
 Naturally I start to freak out and start to try and talk him down. I end up in tears, he's telling me how he hates himself, I hit him in the face, he starts to break down a bit. Stuff started to go a little crazy. My squad leader ended up walking up to us and that is the only time I have ever told him to fuck off and leave me alone.
I won't leave you guys with some cliffhanger, long story short a few other friends come over and talk to him. After he's had a good talk and gotten some feelings out, I throw him in my car. Mind you I'm still terrified at this point. We get back to the barracks, I walk him back up to his room and push him in the closet. I close the door and sleep against it the entire night. The next morning he ends up asking me why he was sleeping in the closet, I told him the story, and that He was not drinking for a very long fucking (emphasis on the fucking) time.

"Oh God, just went through this. 
 I'm a recently 30 dude (recently 30. Dude my whole life lol). 
 I have a female coworker. Divorced, my senior above me (title-wise at work), almost 40, immature and acts like a spoiled 14 yr old princess. Turns out she doesn't have any friends outside of direct team members at work and has been ""depressed"" almost since her divorce about 4-5 years ago. 
 When I started working with her last year, I felt bad for her. I thought she was given a lot of crap from coworkers and our boss when she was trying her best. Also found out that when she went out with my other lady coworkers (a 27 year old woman who, by the way, is all kinds of  fucking awesome  and is my roll model, and another woman about her age) she apparently had a massive emotional breakdown and almost got them to call my companys HR helpline in fear she was going to off herself. 
 But that wasn't the case. She just likes the attention. I also found out that while I was doing both my job AND hers (again, she's my senior mind you), not to mention staying late some days to make sure both of our work is done, missing some lunches and trying my best to show I was a team player to my boss in hopes of a raise/promotion (which I never got) all thinking this let her work on OTHER projects...nope. Turns out the bitch was just surfing facebook, ebay, and calling her mom and/or her sister to cry about how life and work sucks. 
 My boss and my friend both tried to warn me of this for a couple of months (and I listened to them so as to not cause trouble at work), but I didn't really understand the  why  until late last year when I discovered the slacking off aspect while I was busting my ass. 
 Well, I noped the fuck outta that. I now don't help that bitch with anything, I  demand  her to do her job when it impacts my own. For a while my team sat separately from her after we moved offices, but she recently just moved herself next to us. Saying ""it's  so  much more quieter over here. Well...it  was ...until your bitch ass came to our spot and now we hear you call your mom/sister every day to cry and bitch at them about how work and life sucks. 
 She even blew up on coworkers and I for eating lunch without her a few times. In the middle of our office, cafeteria, you name it. Straight up yelling and cursing in the middle of a professional environment. She got so emotionally unstable at points that I almost called our HR helpline as I was worried she might actually off herself and I didn't want to feel responsible. But, once again, she was just manipulating me and my teammates for attention and never had any intention (or so it seems anyway). My boss talked me out of calling the helpline as he said he would call himself. 
 Our team recently changed management, and we keep hoping the new manager will finally do something about her. But holy shit, every day she works at my office is an absolute fucking wonder. She should have been fired at least a dozen times I can think of, but she's still there because my last manager hated confrontation and didn't ever want to deal with her.","Yea, current senior coworker whose a massive attention whore, manipulated me into doing both our jobs and just wont leave.

 It was just another typical day at work, the strange people of Walmart coming in and browsing our merchandise. I was sitting at my desk browsing reddit like usual because it has it's down times. A customer walks an and heads toward the counter, so I go and ask him if I can help him with anything. 
 Customer: Yes I wanna return this phone I bought a couple days ago. 
 I took a look at the phone and it was one of our prepaid cell phones and we have a strict 14 day return policy on them. So I ask if he has te recipes and said he didn't, but he bought it last week.

Just from the look on his face of smugness it made me not want to return it. 
 I decided that instea of doing the task of calling in the cell provider and see when it was first activated, I chose to browse the phone a little bit. I took a look at the setting and could ind any information on when it was activated, so I took a look at te recent calls and went all the way down to the earliest call on the log. The call was made 6 months ago. I chuckled to myself knowing now I can tell him that I know the phone is past it's return date.

"I feel like I'm perhaps 3 months further down the line than you, because I've been through exactly the same thought processes as you are now! 
 I started out last November as a slightly overweight 33 year old who was thankfully quite fit (Cycling, swimming, general fitness all my life) but well out of shape. I have the luxury of time to do my research. 
 I swam and dieted for a couple of months and lost 15lbs, whilst researching my next phase and doing a very basic dumbell routine (the stopgap form the FAQ with added chin ups as it happens). With 3 months before a big holiday, P90x slotted right in there, included some lifting (haha) needed minimal kit and took the planning out of it from my perspective: So I did that. I joined Tony Horton, and pressed play six times a week. I also took time to find a barbell second hand and some plates, and work on form but not really progression in squats, presses, rows and deadlifts. Turns out I like barbell work. 
 So, 25lbs down now and looking a heap better, I've been researching my next step which will start in a month when my holiday is over. I got all the programmes, and looked through them. Actually, my path was pretty obvious to me. Why?  Because I'd gotten off my ass and done something . 
 I've learned SO much about my capacity for working out, my recovery time from specific lifts, which lifts I enjoy and which I find a challenge and need to improve on, that the 'right' programme for me jumped off of the page. Mentality is important too. You need to look at the mindset of the person who has built this programme. What are they trying to promote? what are THEIR goals, and do they marry up to yours? Through P90x (Which gets laughed at in here sometimes, and I can see why, but hey, it worked well for me) and working on lifts in my own time, I've been able to work out what makes me tick enough that choosing my next step became a simple process of elimination. 
 When you get down to the source for things like ICF - that one is actually kind of scary because if you find the video where Blaha sets the programme out, he appears to have given it pretty minimal thought and is just penning out a response to a Forum question as a quick VBlog. ""You will fucking squat if you do my programme""... whatever Blaha. You look a little fat, dude.... 
 Whereas other programmes have the rigour of real science, years of use, plus sensible programming that takes into account the limitations of an untrained beginner. 
 Where am I going with this:","Just do SOMETHING, and stick with it for a couple of months. You will learn so much, you will see your body change. Some of it you will love, some of it you may not like, and you will be able to equate that to your diet and the programme and decide if it's time for a change or a modification to the programme. Making those changes will be obvious to you, because of the self-awareness you now have.

"This is from my freshman year in college. I had just gotten out a long relationship in High School because apparently I made my ex want to have sex but she wasn't ready for it. So she broke it off during the summer before I went to college. When I moved into my dorm, I had just gotten over her and I decided to fuck the first thing possible. 
 This is where I meet the girl across the hall. We had about 3 weeks of late night fun, but she was way too clingy to me.

"This FU happened when I was in high school. I was heavily involved in multiple afterschool activities and had a lot going on at the time. Specifically, this was my sophomore year and I had been accepted into an early-entrance-to-college program (meaning I was leaving high school to go to college full time) the next year. I was in all honors classes, actively involved in choir (about 3 days away from our yearly choir trip, which I had already paid for), and active in the theatre troupe as a technician (building props, gathering costumes, running lights and setup during shows, etc). 
 That day, we had a field trip (either through geography class or history or some BS class like that) to the local Federal Reserve Bank. Our teacher set expectations with us over and over, don't have a phone, don't have a camera, they're going to walk you through a metal detector, blah blah blah... I was feeling pretty confident, but decided to check my purse one last time just to be sure. As I'm digging through it, I realize, Fuck, I have a swiss army knife in there. I later insisted to all my teachers that I had it for use of the screwdriver in drama tech, which was partially true, but I also had it just because I like pocket knives. ( Always have, always will. ) 
 So, instead of doing the logical thing and tossing it in a trash can, in the grass, pretty much ANYWHERE, I walk back out to the school bus and let the teacher know I found it in my purse, then hand it to him. He makes a pissed off face at me, takes it, then tells me to go back inside and that's that. 
 So I thought. 
 We get back near the end of the day, have lunch, and go to class. I was literally so not thinking about the knife that when they called me into the principal's office with another random student (who was on the field trip), I'm thinking that they want to congratulate me on my acceptance into the college program. That is, until I walk past my Spanish teacher's classroom and she's standing in the hallway staring at me and mumbles; ""See you in two weeks."" At this point, it all clicks and I go into a total panic. I start bawling and sob all the way down to and into the office. I go in and the vice principal tells me that I'm going to be given 3 days OSS (out of school suspension), won't be allowed to go on the school choir trip, cannot make up my work during this time, AND that I need to call my mom and tell her to come pick me up. The fact that my mom was an on-duty police officer at the time didn't help. The punishment at the time was particularly strict due to a number of high school violence incidents happening around the country the past few years. I was considered to have had a ""weapon."" 
 So I make the phone call and spend the next hour (until my mother can get in) sobbing helplessly in the office, embarassing the shit out of all the secretaries and any misc parents or students that wander in. In my head, I'm also thinking that my new school is going to refuse me for being a criminal or some shit. I'm also thinking about how my mom is going to kill me and how much I literally hate every teacher in that stupid school. 
 By the time my mom gets there, I've apparently caused enough of a scene that the principal decides to take pity on me and gives me 3 days ISS (in school suspension), starting after the choir trip, and no further punishment. By the time I left the office, I had no less than three of my teachers tell me they would have happily given me all of my classwork regardless and my choir teacher offered to smuggle me onto the bus before I even told her I had had my punishment downgraded to ISS. 
 Bonus: While in ISS the supervising teacher let me do whatever I want, including listening to music, going to the library, and standing in the hallway for long periods of time to catch up with my friends who were ""delivering me classwork.""","Fucked up by bringing a swiss army knife to the federal reserve bank on a field trip, then giving it to my teacher.

"Surgery Time…
I have lots of questions & would appreciate any input that you guys can give me.
My son is 19years old.  He was diagnosed with crohns in 2010 after hellatious flair.  He was on pentasa & steroids.  This helped for a while but he had another flair at the end of 2010/beginning 2011.  He was placed on remicade & imuran-This was fabulous.  He had a pretty good year.  They took him off the imuran after a year 06/2013 because of health risks with the drug & because he was doing really well.  After they took him off the immurine the remicade stopped working.  His body would not respond to the medication.  They put him back on imuran & doubled his remicade dose-Still no response-We are in full flair.  I almost took him to the ER for dehydration.  His doc was out for a month for a hospital rotation –So we couldn’t see anyone or get any help.  My son was in a great deal of pain-couldn’t eat-was throwing up & of course multiple bathroom visits.  His regular GI had seen some scar tissue on his last CT .  I got desperate-called Emery University in Atlanta GA-We met with a GI Dr. Dhere who reviewed all of his past tests & scans.  She stated that he did have scar tissue & that they would probably need to remove a small section of his ileum-A resection.   He had an MRI & we sat down with surgeon.  She did not show us the MRI but stated that there was a diseased portion of his ileum. Her plan is to remove a small portion of the ileum-the valve that connects the ileum with the colon-remove a small portion of his colon & remove his appendix.
This was a lot more surgery than what we had planned.  She said it could give him decades of relief-Of course the flip side is the crohns could come back.  It could come back to the surgery site-He of course could get an infection-& all of the other dangers involved with surgery.
Has anyone else had this surgery done? Has anyone else had any experience with Emery?
Is all of this necessary?  Is this being to aggressive? 
I am terrified-My son is hopeful.
I just know that you can’t undo surgery & you can’t grow back your intestines-There is only so much to cut.  Any help that is given will be greatly appreciated.

"I'm not a woman but as a fellow short guy (we're the same height) I would like to offer my insight. 
 Women will always, always, ALWAYS prefer a taller guy if that's the only factor we're looking at here. Just like you, as a guy, will always prefer a woman with whatever characteristic you find more attractive. 
 When I was younger I had a really tough time coping with this. As a foolish male who assumed that women were just as visually-oriented as men, I thought looks and height were the most important factors when it came to being attractive to women. On top of being short, though, I was also in the racial minority. Asian men are generally seen as pretty undesirable in the US. Sad but true. 
 Naturally I attributed the tough time I was having with women with being short and Asian, and since those are factors I cannot change I would have lost all hope if it weren't for my damn persistence and unshakeable belief that ""where there is a will there is a way."" Well, I didn't always believe that but after what I've experienced I sure as hell believe that now. 
 I eventually found myself amidst a large internet community of fedora-wearing men who called themselves pickup artists, and the majority of the ones I've met in person were weirdos. There were always a few really cool guys here and there, though, that I learned very valuable things from. The majority of my learning has been independent, though, whether it be through my own research of the seduction community's material or my personal trials through trying to pick up women myself. While there were a bunch of awkward and manipulative tactics out there, the pickup artists taught a lot of more normal things that normal people do that naturally help foster genuine chemistry between a man and a woman. 
 Here's the kicker, though: None of that shit I learned had anything to do with height. It turns out that there's A LOT a man can do to make himself more attractive no matter how short he is. Social/seductive skill is more important than height/looks. 
 I eventually got really good at connecting with women and having wonderful intimate experiences with women who would have initially turned me down due to my height. Good enough to have become recognized as a respected blogger and teacher within the pickup artist community, at least! And I'm only 5'7"" on a good day. 
 As /u/sonofaresiii commented, being short always takes away a few points but you can make up for those points in other ways. He/she is absolutely right. Some women might weigh more importance on height but in the end you can usually overwhelm a woman with enough passion for her to forget all about her preconceived preferences if you know what you're doing. 
 So there's really no need for anyone to feel bad about those ridiculously insulting comments from that ""Heightism"" Twitter feed someone posted here, and there's no need to get discouraged from the very real bias that women certainly have for taller men. Where there is a will there is a way.",How attractive you are to women will be determined more by what you do rather than what you're born with.,20,M,AskReddit
"In 8th grade I dated a girl (referred to as W) who had recently moved from New Jersey. This lasted a year and three months before I broke up with her because she was batshit crazy. During the last few months I had met two girls (C and M) that I was interested in. One already had a boyfriend (C) and one was single (M). I chased after both after breaking up with W. 
 Soon after breaking up with W however, another girl entered the picture, A. She already had a boyfriend but was particularly loose and I was particularly lonely, getting used to single life again. C and M weren't having either of my advances (in my eyes, I would find out later both liked me, more on that later) so I went with A because she broke up with her boyfriend for me. A week later the same thing happened to me (I would find out two days later that she had been dating another guy during that week as well). Two relationships down, 1 cheating, 1 crazy. 
 Next I continued with C and M. C had recently switched boyfriends (I believe 2 actually, one of which is one of my best friends). M stayed single. I flirted hard with C and tried to get her but she wouldn't budge (A few months ago I found out from a friend that she really liked me, but didn't do anything about it). I gave up and moved on to M. We started dating and everything was going well. A week before she broke up with me one of her best friends was getting hit on by a guy (R) and said he was a creep and all. Then she broke up with me and I found out from a few sources that an hour later she was dating that same ""creep"" and that she had been flirting with him and kissed him during that last week. 
 R and M dated for a while. I remained M's best friend and continued to like her. I tried to win her back but to no avail so I waited. R had a long history of cheating on girls and eventually he asked M's best friend for a blowy. With some of my own advice and pushing, M broke up with him. 
 The next year M and I got back together. She had recently been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and the effects were showing through. Throughout our entire 2nd relationship she cheated on me with some really butch girl (I forgot to mention that she's bi in two areas). Apparently nobody decided to tell me because everyone who knew either thought I knew and was cool with it or they were told to keep their mouths shut. 
 Anyway, M broke up with me and soon after moved across the state to live with her father. We remained good friends. This was about halfway through the year. In December I got with another girl (T). She was really cool. She was cute and liked all the stuff I did and was into sci-fi and shit. We dated for 5 months. During the last month weird things kept happening. We'd have these moments where she showed absolutely no interest in our relationship. Avoiding conversations and physical contact completely, barely conversing when we did talk, all that stuff. Then she would be interested again. Moving on, she broke up with me on the last day of school (funny thing, she told me that she broke up with me on the last day of school so she wouldn't ruin my exam week, instead it was a better idea to ruin one of the best days for a high schooler. 
 Today, I don't talk to any of those girls. W is a major whore now (she chased after three separate people with my same name, my sister and I think I gave her some mental disorder) and she's dating somebody who graduated a year ago. C is still dating that same guy. We haven't talked since I got back with M. I slowly stopped talking to M because I finally realized how much of a bitch she is and how stupid I was. I tried contacting her recently in an attempt to rekindle our friendship but she didn't answer. She holds grudges. T and I don't talk and I don't plan on talking to her or trying to get back with her. I've learned my lesson on that.

"Back before college, I worked at Safeway as a courtesy clerk. Courtesy clerk is basically shorthand for ""everyone in the management and every customer gets to shit on you and you can't do anything about it because you're essentially replaceable at any moment."" 
 At the time I was pretty timid and very meek if you didn't know me personally. But I still think this day was the day my balls dropped and I became a man. 
 It had been a busy day and on top of me picking up the slack for my lazy co-workers, I had to clean up some absurd mess in the bathroom. 
 As an aside, when people are buying groceries, they forget to pay for a LOT of things. Between leaving it on the bottom of their cart, or just holding it in their hands while they check out, people just don't end up paying for things sometimes. Most people don't mean to, some people do. But most times, the checker will casually mention it and people are very apologetic and they pay for their stuff without incident. 
 So on this shitty day where I had to clean up this mess, an old couple comes through my line and the old man has a newspaper in his cart that didn't make it through grocery scanner. So I said to the checker, ""hey, did you get that paper?"" to which she replies ""nope,"" and adds it to the couple's total. The paper was wrapped and had our scan tag on it, so I know he picked it up at our store. 
 Out of the corner of my eye, I see the old man staring holes in the side of my head. So I turned to him and just smiled and gave him the head nod. But he continues to stare. Then he takes a step in my direction, like a foot or two from my face (ALL UP IN MY FUCKING KOOL AID) and YELLS, ""I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE ACCUSING ME OF STEALING."" 
 I play it cool, as I'm still a timid teen that cares about his shitty Safeway job in High School. 
 ""Oh, sir, I wasn't accusing you of anything, but people forget things in their cart all the time. It's no problem, we got it."" And then I went back to bagging his stuff. 
 At this point, the whole store is quiet and staring at me and this dude who just yelled at me. 
 Apparently my answer wasn't satisfactory. 
 ""Listen you little shit,"" he yelled again. ""I don't like people who bag my groceries accusing me of stealing."" 
 At this point I'm slowly beginning to rage. But I REALLY TRIED to play it cool. 
 ""Well I'm sorry sir, I was just making sure our checker got the paper. I wasn't accusing you of anything."" 
 Well he was still pissed, and yells AGAIN. 
 ""Well how about I grab your manager and get you fired, I shop here all the time and I won't accept this from a bag boy."" 
 At that point, I had had enough. 
 It was the first time in my life I ever stuck up for myself. I'll never forget it. A light switch in my soul flipped from little bitch mode to alpha in an instant. 
 I turned to him, straight to his face and said ""Grab my fucking manager then, I don't give a shit. If you think you're better than me because I bag your groceries, then you're a bigger asshole than I thought. And it's okay to admit that you forgot the paper, it happens all the time. Just say you forgot. Jesus!"" 
 At that point, I knew I was fired, as a small crowd had gathered, including my manager. I gave that old bastard the death glare straight in his geriatric fucking pre-cataract eyes. 
 But at that moment, the old guy caved. I literally watched his face sink and his shoulders cower. 
 It was completely bizarre. He just started apologizing profusely. He left ALL his groceries in their bags, unpaid, and just left the store with his wife. 
 Oh, and I didn't get fired. Good times.",stand up to old people (or people in general) if they're being assholes. Just because I serve you doesn't mean shit. Treat everyone with respect.,18,M,AdviceAnimals
"Hello reddit, 
 First, I'd like to say that I'm not writing this post to attract attention or garner encouragement. Both would be nice, but my only goal is to have a place to hold myself accountable. I've decided that this subreddit will be that place. 
 I'm no different than thousands of other souls who have posted here, so I'll spare you the long bio. The short: 20 years old, rising Sophomore at a decent college, decent grades, an extracurricular activity that I've pursued for most of my life and that I'm pretty good at, and yet...I'm the laziest, most spineless, least confident, most undisciplined person you'll ever meet. 
 I started this summer with grand plans to change my life, bit by bit, but everything has failed. I sit in my room, binge on Netflix, fap all the time, mindlessly surf Youtube/the Internet for hours, don't go to the gym, etc. During college, I would do my homework at the last minute, hang out with my few friends, but I wouldn't do anything truly meaningful. Same wasting-time shit, no girls, no nothing. Just emptiness. I love this subreddit, but I've tried every method in the book and nothing has worked. I'll start some good habits, make a tiny bit of progress, and then relapse in some area and think ""ah, fuck it"" and go right back to where I was. This summer I was gonna get better at programming (I'm thinking of majoring in CS), read all of those books I never got around to reading, do meditation, go to the gym, start flossing, and nothing happened. 
 I'm desperate -- my life is not in any immediate danger or anything, but I'm sick and tired of going through every day hating myself, unable to change. I feel like my willpower and discipline is dropping by the day. So for the next 30 days, until August 28, I will experiment with a new method: I will become my perfect, robotic self, torture myself by doing everything the perfect me would do, and write daily updates documenting my progress. Here is the breakdown: 
 Every day, I will do the following things: 1. Get up immediately with my first alarm, regardless of the time. 2. Take a cold shower. 3. Brush three times a day, and floss twice. 4. Wash my face two times a day (I have some residual acne from my teenage days). 5. Read at least 25 pages a day. 6. Refrain from fapping, or even touching my penis for anything other than peeing/washing it. 7. No youtube, Netflix, or Facebook, and a maximum of 45 minutes of Internet usage (discounting urgent things like answering an important e-mail). 8. A minimum of 7 hours of sleep per day. 9. Going to the gym or equivalent (push-ups at home -- I have a friend who's given me a home workout to do, or a long bike ride) every day. 10. Keeping absolute, perfect order in my house, putting everything where it needs to be. 11. No TV. 12.No drinks other than coffee, tea, or water. 13. At least 30 minutes of coding training every day. 
 That's what I've come up with so far. I'll definitely take other ideas. I know what you're thinking: I'm not the first or the last person to try this shit, and it's never worked in the history of humankind. You can't become someone you aren't overnight. It doesn't work like that. You'll relapse on the very first day. And that's why I'm posting here. Because you're wrong. And I'm going to prove it by writing an update every single day. I dare you to tell me I can't do it. The challenge starts the second I click submit. I will most of my allotted 45 minutes each day to answer any comments and write updates (if, of course, anyone expresses interest).",Trying to change my life overnight.

"My friends told me to meet them at the wrong place for brunch on accident, and figuring I got there first. For the next 45 minutes we were on the phone trying to figure out who fucked up, and how I was supposed to get to them, even though I had spent 40 minutes getting to the place on buses (which I was terrible at figuring out), then the extra time waiting there. They ordered brunch without me and told me to still try to make it. I was 19 and kind of poor looking (art school chic) in this upscale neighborhood, and I was the only party of one, and I felt awful, and started to feel a panic attack coming on. Then a homeless lady asked me for change and I gave her some and she, trying to say something nice back in exchange for change, asks me if I'm pregnant. I was not pregnant. I left right then and got kinda lost and I was crying all over the place and sat down in front of a whole foods and this other homeless lady comes by. I have no more change and tell her so, but she says ""that's all right"" and sits down, and asks me what's wrong. Well, I felt really stupid telling her why I was crying when she's fucking homeless and I'm just this teenager with social anxiety, but she just talks to me for 20 minutes or so, until I calm down.

"Hello everyone, 
 I have never posted in this sub before but I often come through here when I am feeling extra down. It has been a pretty long time since I have been truly happy, and that is part of the problem. Because my mom claims that drugs and tobacco made me so sad and upset but I can not remember if I felt like this before. 
 So let me tell the whole story. I am 16 years old, and I first smoked weed when I was 12/13 (Not exactly sure) and I was smoking hookah and disposable ehookahs at that time too. I stopped smoking weed a few months after I started because my parents found out (It will become apparent that I am terrible at hiding things from them) and forced me to. I continued smoking disposable hookah on a semi regular basis, and I smoked hookah very rarely. Fast forward about three more months, I got into some trouble at school cheating on a mid-term and my parents decided to transfer me to a different school that I absolutely can not stand. From then until now (about 2 years) I have not smoked weed but I started really vaping, which my parents found out about, and I smoke hookah much more regularly. It must be said that in my culture smoking hookah is pretty well accepted, and my dad does not care (but if my mom found out she would kill both of us). Also, I got into trouble at my new school for being caught vaping there (dumb decision, paid/paying severely for it, please don't ridicule me about this) and my parents took my vape away, but I told them either they give it back or I would just find a way to get another. 
 This brings me more up to this exact moment. I have told my parents that I am very depressed and I want to die, and basically I have suicide ideation. For me, smoking and vaping and hanging out with my friends are the only things that make me feel happy (temporarily). My mom disagrees with this entirely, and both my mom and dad have some misconception that I am a drug addict. My dad says every time I come home from being with my friends my eyes look like I have been doing something, although they have and do drug test me whenever they think I am acting weird and I have never taken a test that came back positive. Also, my mom does not like me going out and she always thinks that I will get in trouble because she doesn't like my friends, even though they are some of the greatest people I have ever met in terms of looking out for the best interests of others. 
 Also, I must add that my life has been pretty easy. I get really anything I need or want. My parents are very loving and I know they really just want what is best for me. My problem is that I feel so horrible inside, and my parents do not understand. Going to the high school I attend kills me inside, and my parents do not trust me in the slightest. Aside from that, I make myself happy however I can (smoking, vaping, chilling with friends). I try to go to the gym but I have absolutely zero drive to because it does not make me more happy at all. 
 Back to the main question though, did my smoking and drug use make me depressed, or is it something else? My mom focuses on the fact that using marijuana had to do with my depression, and so do my current actions. I really do not want to stop smoking and vaping because these are the only things that make me happy, but if you guys say that they really would be making me sad that is a different situation. If other people who can understand how I feel think that my parents are really right, then maybe I should stop.

"Me 23M her 22F, known each other for ~8 years, close friends for the past several. 
 Some background on the issue: I am fairly introverted, and have trouble opening up to people. Thus, I while I have many acquaintances, I have few friends that I actually trust and can confide in. The friend (lets call her Jane) and I went to high school together, and hung out quite a bit before we graduated. Jane and I fell out of contact after I moved a few hours away for college, and only reconnected last summer after I moved back home to take a year off. 
 In the time since we've reconnected, Jane and I had taken to hanging out quite frequently, generally every other weekend, sometimes multiple nights a weekend. Jane is currently in a relationship, but has frequently complained about the lack of attention from her SO, and it seems Jane and her SO get in verbal disagreements quite frequently. I kinda felt like in the rough spots, I was being kinda shoohorned into being a stand-in BF for her as we hung out, as we frequently went out with friends and sometimes 1 on 1, and in these situations I would pay for her as she is currently doing an unpaid apprenticeship. 
 Of course, this all didn't help things with me emotionally. I had a mild crush on her in high school, and this attention made those feelings stronger. So on a whim, I asked her if she would consider me ""dateable"" if she wasn't involved with her SO...and she said yes. She has since stated that there is no awkwardness between us, it's just she can't reciprocate my feelings at this time. 
 The crux of the matter is this: I have just moved ~2000 miles away for graduate school, and and scheduled to be here for the next 5 years. She's currently doing her apprenticeship for the next ~10 months, plus a possible 2 years commitment to her mentor. The day before I left, I set up a No Contact period extending 2 weeks to evaluate how I feel about her, and where to go. I'm coming to the conclusion that I value my friendship with Jane enough that I need to put my feelings for Jane behind me for the sake of the friendship. However I feel that if I did so I would just be untruthful to both of us, as those feelings might taint future interactions.

"I have been dating my girlfriend for 4 years now and for the longest time we have been talking about going away together. A combination of school, work and other real life circumstances has always prevented this. 
 Recently, I found a fantastic deal, one that would save thousands of dollars on this vacation. I have regularly checked for deals to this destination for the past 7 years of my life, this is the best I've ever seen. The dates were perfect too. I eagerly told her and she stone-cold said no. She did not want to leave the city and go on vacation given the circumstances. 
 Right now, due to an economic downturn in the area, she has recently become unemployed and won't be employed in the forseeable future as she finishes her degree. 
 However, I don't think that money is an issue. I am a graduate student currently making about $60K per year from a combination of funding and working (a lot) on the side. I currently have about $230K in savings, $17k in a chequing and an additional $7.5K in a separate, special, savings account ear-marked for nothing else except this vacation. I started saving for this since about a month after we started dating. Neither of us have any other significant assets. Neither of us have any debt. 
 The vacation dates correspond to just after I finish my thesis defense, after she finishes her last courses, we arrive home before convocation, before I start a full time job and the exchange rate is getting close to the best it has been in about 5 years. 
 Am I crazy? Isn't the timing about as perfect as it gets? I can't get a reason out of her why she won't come with me other than money. 
 This vacation means a lot to me. I come from a fairly broken home, I have no siblings and noone I consider family other than her. I have never went on a family vacation (or any vacation). I was jobless, with a grade 8 education and no money when I was 20. I feel like I largely wasted my teens and early 20s and being 29 now. I feel like I will never be able to get an opportunity like this to go on vacation while I am still somewhat young. She is very well aware of all of this. 
 After I start my job, my ability to go on an extended vacation will be limited. I have worked very hard and deprived myself of many hours of sleep to get to this point and I can't help but be extremely disappointed. 
 Going on my own is not an option. She would be okay with it but I would only be able to think of what could have been. It could not do anything except possibly put an unnecessary strain on our relationship. 
 I have sat for a very long time trying to rationalize her point of view. The only thing I can come up with is that due to her unemployment, she is unwilling to go on vacation if she didn't earn at least some portion of the funds. 
 The only other case I can dream of is that she would rather prepare saving for a wedding, home, or perhaps children (I have stated repeatedly over the years that I have no interest in children). 
 Am I being unreasonable? I had recently read on TIFU about a guy who overspent on his prom date who wouldn't spend time with him at the prom and the comments at the time were seemingly in resounding favor of his prom date. Because he couldn't seem to understand his dates feelings.

I fully acknowledge that the tone of this post is very much centered around me. I can't help it. They offer free psychiatric help at my university and this has rattled me enough to consider booking an appointment so I can work through this. 
 I also fully acknowledge how stupid and creepy it must be to get the idea to secretly save so soon after we started dating. It sounded like a romantic and good idea until it backfires.

"Here's one thing people haven't told you about living in Duluth; it's better than it's ever been. I was born here, grew up in the cities, live in WI for 1 year, and came back when I was about 12 (I'm 32 now).  I look back on what my options were 20 years ago versus now, and I'm so proud of what Donny Ness has accomplished. For nearly a decade prior to Ness, we had Doty as a mayor--an old, rude, codger who had little tolerance for anything that wasn't white-bred, wholesome goodness. Toward the end of his city service, it was quite enjoyable to watch his reputation collapse under the weight of his own hubris. 
 Downtown--the space that used to consist of a few dives and  maybe  one or two cool taverns has entered a renaissance. There are not only more nightlife options, but more renovated and interesting places to go. Tycoon's, Red Star, 7 West Taphouse, Dubhlin's, Carmody's, Ace's, Spurs, Teatro Zuccone...10 years ago, not one of these establishments existed. 
 The Last Place has become a nuisance, but do what I do--ignore it! So there are druggies hanging around downtown, big deal--every downtown has this problem, and contrary to what others say, this was a problem  before  recent salvia woes. 
 People keep saying you have to ""Make your own fun""....I'd like to know in what city ""fun"" rubs its butt against your front door? Hike to the end of the Park Point trails with a bottle of local microbrew and watch the sunset over the WI pier. Take a canoe to Island Lake into all the tiny Island inlets where no other types of watercraft can go and check out the hundreds of species of bird that hide in there with a Great Harvest bread co turkey sandwich and a fishing pole. Go to movies, bars, and the theatre--you know, the same things you can do in any town. The only difference is there may not be as many people jammed in the same space with you when you do it.","Duluth isn't for everyone, and it's not perfect.

"Watching anything on youtube is my entertainment after work. it's funny because I'm a mid twenties male who watches the vlog but not too many people know about it.

 All this being said, it's crazy to find out just how many people I know that watch the same stuff as I do.

"A little bit of background story here (sorry for the text wall)
So I was born in U.S., and you can tell by my username, I'm Asian, Chinese in particular.
I was sent to China in 1st-3rd grade to study Chinese and so most of my English was under a kindergarten grade level and by the time I had finish 3rd grade, I know little to no English since we don't speak English in China, but I did went to an International School which had English class all the way from 1st-12th grade. But the English classes were pretty crappy.
Fast forward to 4th grade, since people in China were very self-conscious, they don't want to be embarrassed or humiliated in anyway. So I was pretty shy, don't want to be embarrassed about my poor English skills and stuff, so from 4th-8th grade, I literally spoke to nobody. And I mean NOBODY, not a single word (I did went better when I was going through 7-8th grade though). And because I was still considered ""foreign"", I had to take special classes where they tutor me and gave me extra English classes. 
The tutor was pretty bad, it was a preschool teacher in the building trying to teach us foreign kids while managing to control the preschoolers. And because of that I was shy, and didn't speak a single word, I pretty much have no way of saying ""I don't know what these words are saying."" And so, she thought I was just lazy, didn't do any work, when I hand her in blank papers she just sighs and rolls her eyes at me, to the point where she just doesn't speak to me at all and leaves me alone at my desk doing nothing.
This went on until the end of the year, where the teacher decided to have a party and brought in a xbox, food, drinks and stuff. But she didn't tell me there was a party. When I went to her class, she wasn't there, so I just went to my homeroom teacher and stare at her (she's one of my favorite and greatest teacher and understands me a lot) and said ""oh, she's in room xxx having a party, you didn't know?"" So I went to the room, there they were, having a fantastic time, opened the door, she looked at me with the same look she looked at me for the whole semester, and said, ""What are you doing here?? Go to your homeroom, you don't deserve this, you can only be here for doing your work and not slack off all day.""
I went back, in tears. It might seem like it wasn't anything major, but for me, it was. At the end, it pretty much made me hating school for over 3 years and making barely passed grades. It still affected me later on because I pretty much was a kindergartner English level kid going through middle school, and it did affected me by being more shy around people and not being social and alone for years until high school came, and it wasn't a very good feeling, being alone, no friends to talk to, being rejected. And I think it certainly affected me in high school too since I was in all the shitty classes with all these red necks and druggies and foreign kids like me in 4th grade who just moved to U.S. recently (well except for Math haha).",Bad teacher who made no effort in teacher a foreign kid and ending up affecting him (me) for years and made him shy and not sociable and awkward.,27,M,AskReddit
"Last Sunday was my first time dead lifting (just beginning starting strength).  I had been doing barbell lifting before that, but had always been scared of DL because it looked like an easy way to get hurt.  I read every dead lift article I could find on fittit and watched all the youtube videos of Ripptoe coaching the deadlift.  I did 3x5 135 lbs (as well as warm up), which felt pretty light (6'7"", 195lbs).  I'm sure my form wasn't perfect, according to my gf I rounded my lower back a bit.  I felt fine immediately afterwards. 
 The next day I woke up, my lower back was stiff as a brick.  Being tall, lanky, and having mild scoliosis, I'm constantly worried about back and freaked out, thinking something must have exploded.  I looked up some stretches and iced, but it was just as bad by Tuesday.  I decided to call a orthopedic doctor to have a look at it, and avoided lower back (squat / deadlift) exercises, as well as skipping the gym entirely on one day. 
 Saw the doctor today, and by this time over a week has gone by and the pain is almost gone.  Told the doctor exactly what I wrote above, including that I had begun dead lifting.  He frowns, tells me I shouldn't ever lift free weights without a personal trainer, tells me to stick to machines (""they're just as good""), and do core exercises on a bosu ball, tells me to schedule a few appointments with the physical therapist across the street (who just happened to have a rep working in his office) to strengthen my core, and see him again in a month for a followup.  Commented that it was most likely muscle soreness, no physical issues. 
 Obviously not what I wanted to hear, and I feel very frustrated.  I'm not a doctor and I'm unsure if it's arrogance or skepticism but I completely disagree everything he said, having subscribed to /r/fitness for the last few months.

 Hi, so I barely met this girl about a month ago, we started kind of dating and hit it off pretty well. 2 weeks into she tells me she hates it here, we are in a progressive city that just keeps changing. The culture that was here has been transformed into another mecca of classy life style where the rich and vain have left to come make this place like what they left. 
 Regardless of that I don't know where I quite stand with her. I just know I care about her well being. She told me she was leaving to Portland. Really really far from Texas. I was kind of depressed afterwards and discontinued talking to her for the rest of the day. 
 She got in touch later that night and told me all about her plans, later she asked if I  wanted to come along. I felt a sense of joy that she would want me to go with her. But a sense of fear knowing that I would be leaving my home. I own 2 dogs a home I have a great job in the software business and I am young in my Mid 20's. I have everything going for me in this city. But I am willing to sell it all and rent my home out to see where this girl and adventure take me. 
 I have decided to leave my job, leave my home, a good portion of my family resides in this city. I have decided to leave it all behind to chase the unknown. I cant tell anyone that a girl helped me influence the decision of always wanting to leave.","Met a girl, barely know her, leaving home town to start a new life in a place where making it back home can be challenging.",25,M,confession
"So I am 20 years old virgin and have never been in a relationship. 
 I always used to crush pretty fast on girls I found attractive in school. I didn't even know those girls.. 
 Nowadays its still the same: I dont crush that quickly on a girl I find attractive anymore, but I still feel like I only can fall in love with women I find attractive. 
 I started studying at a new University last year and hang out alot with 2 particular girls: 
 Girl A I find attractive and get along with her well, but I dont see the chemistry, it doesnt feel like we would fit well. We are too diffrent in some aspects. 
 Girl B is really cool, we have a lot in common, she understands my humor and I can be myself around her. I think we would fit very well together in a relationship. I even think she likes me a little more than friends. However I dont find her that attractive. She is by no means ugly or fat, but neither a stunner. 
 The thing is, I started to develop feelings for Girl A. Not those crushy feelings from my early years, it was stronger. 
 I dont know why my feelings are based so much on appealings? I could imagine such a great relationship with Girl B.

"I M[24] have been dating my girlfriend [23] for 3 months now. She is very funny and attractive. We always have a lot of fun together and balance each other out. I am more mature and further along in my career then her which she finds very sexy. Everything has been a real blast and now I hope I am not over analyzing events that happened this past week. 
 I knew she was going to be working late on V day so I took her out the day before. We had a great time, drank some wine ate dinner and went back to my place later. On actual Valentines day she got off work late and decided to go drinking until 6AM with friends. I'm kind of turned off because I am not looking for another party girl, and more so she has much more important things to be focusing on. 
 I called her Friday night so we could hang out this weekend. To my surprise rather then her locking down Saturday/Sunday she gave me the ""I will call you after work tomorrow"". I was pissed that she actually thought I was going to just sit around and not make any plans until she calls me to then let me know if she would hang out. This is unacceptable and I won't put up with it. She calls last night and tells me she wants to go to a movie with a friend and asked if we can hangout tomorrow (being Sunday). I told her I couldn't hang out tomorrow and I would call her later (just wanted to get off phone) 
 Now ironically, I already had a bad week and just wanted to see her. So now I am in the mindset of asking myself should I start emotionally detaching myself from this girl.

"I'm a twenty-four year old female and my boyfriend and I are becoming more and more serious as time goes on. We have been together for one year now. Here is the problem: his brother, who he lives with, is an absolute asshole. Before going on to describe why this is such a problem for me, I want to talk a little more about his brother, who I will call Josh. 
 Josh regularly describes the shitty ways he treats women and the shitty ways he tries to sleep with as many women as possible. Now, while I don't necessarily think it's bad to sleep with a lot of people (if it's consensual and done respectfully on both parts), he intentionally manipulates women to get what he wants and then is really mean to them after things are over. He admitted to having left a girl in the middle of the woods when she was high on ecstasy and he was drunk (he was driving) because she annoyed him and he no longer felt like getting in her pants. 
 Another example: this summer he knew this one girl who he had met online wanted a relationship from her online profile, yet he went out on a date with her solely for the intention of having sex with her and never sleeping with her again. He hadn't slept with anyone in four months, so he really just wanted to get laid. Now I know a lot of people do this, and I can understand his sexual frustration, but the way he did it was really shitty. He slept with her, then the next day talked to my boyfriend and I about how fat she was and how disgusting she was and what bad lay it was. These things are possible, but the way he discusses them is rude and uncalled for. It's simply indicative of his general disrespect for women. He has a technique he has called the ""machine gun makeout"" which is basically to keep leaning in to kiss a woman, and each time she turns away, he tries again, and keeps trying until she gives in. He combines this technique with his ""drink technique"" of buying girls a drink, letting them drink half, then slamming the rest himself and buying them another one. This one is based on the theory that girls drink the first half of their drink really fast and the last half slow. He is honestly this manipulative. 
 One time Josh made a pass at me about two months after his brother and I were official and I (obviously) turned him down. I told him ""I couldn't be less attracted to you given your shallow personality"", yet when I told his brother about it Josh claimed I had been wanting him all along and was asking for it. 
 Josh spends all his days off work smoking weed, drinking, and trying to use more women for sex. I don't have any problem with weed and drinking, but both of those things are pretty much all he ever does. He has no ambition. No wish to find someone he cares about and settle down. No wish to ever have kids. He just wants to go to work and then party on his days off. 
 Lastly, Josh is terrible with money. He makes almost $100k a year but lives paycheck to paycheck, spending it all on buiyng more ""toys"" (e.g. dirtbike, jetboat, truck). Again, I'm not against buying nice things for yourself as long as you budget and save for the future. He once asked me (I'm in medical school), ""What kind of STUFF are you going to buy once you are a doctor?"" I told him that I was going to buy a house first of all, and he laughed and said, ""NO. COOL stuff! Mercedes? Mustang?"" He really doesn't understand that there are things to life other than money. He asked my boyfriend to go half and half on a mortgage so they could buy a house together. I did not give my opinion because I felt it was none of my business, but was secretly SO relieved when my boyfriend told him no. I think it's a terrible idea to enter into such a long-term financial commitment with someone who is hugely in debt and can't hold onto money even with a great paying job. 
 Anyways... back to the beginning. I hate this person more than I've ever hated anyone. I haven't described the half of it because I want to keep this short enough for people to read, but I hope you can understand the situation. My question is... would this be a dealbreaker for anyone? Up until this point in the post I haven't talked about my relationship with my boyfriend, but let me just say it is INCREDIBLE. Amazing communication. Amazing sex. We are seriously perfect partners. He makes me laugh so much that I cry sometimes. But sometimes I imagine the future and I feel sick. His brother's financial habits seem to influence him somewhat. He isn't as terrible as Josh is, but he definitely doesn't save money. I am a huge saver (seeing as how I had to put myself through medical school) and I could see those mentalities conflicting. Also if we have kids one day... his brother will be their uncle. And I couldn't keep the kids away from his brother, that would be unfair to my boyfriend. So my hypothetical children would be influenced by this man (who trust me, will never change - he never wants to get married or have children, so he will always be that creepy uncle josh). I think it would be even worse if I had boys because he would want to do things with them and teach them his ""techniques"" with women. It makes me want to punch something imagining these children who don't even exist yet having to be around this man who I despise with a passion. 
 So anyways. Despite this perfect relationship with my boyfriend, do you think this sort of thing (hating one of his family members so much) could ruin it? I know that typical answers on this thread are ""end it, move on"", but I would appreciate some input other than that because it's not realistic. It seems silly to end a great relationship because of someone who isn't even one of the members of the relationshp. It should just be about me and my boyfriend, right? At this point it's easy to ignore his brother as we're doing distance while I finish my last year of medical school. But at some point in the next year we will be hopefully living close by again and I will once more have to deal with his brother on a regular basis since they live together. And potentially deal with his brother for the rest of my life. This pains me. 
 Any thoughts would be appreciated, especially if anyone has ever been in a similar circumstance!","I hate my boyfriend's brother and I'm scared this is a dealbreaker, despite the fact that the relationship that is important (the one between me and my boyfriend) is the one that should matter the most.",24,F,relationships
"Me [19 M/] with my have been with my [18/F] for around 3 months at university and it has been going great.  Except I believe that I am emotionally frayed in this relationship and truly want to be with someone else but can't leave due to my own pride and that the relationship is going splendidly outside of this.  First off I want to say that my current relationship with my girlfriend is the first girl that I have ever dated.  She is very fantastic even though we have some differing life views, she is very religious, will not drink (which is hard since we are university students), and will not have sex until marriage.  I can get over these things but the reason is someone else, someone who can not make me feel the way she does.  Lets call this girl Katie.  Katie is a Senior at a different college, and we worked together over the summer last year and became extremely close.  I felt free with her, my life was total bliss around her, and I wanted to be with her every second.  At the time she had feelings for another guy so I figured I can't do much about that and just became real close friends with her.  We still talked a little bit through out my freshman year of University, and over Christmas break I realized that her and that boy were a thing of the past.  We would occasionally text each other however nothing special.  Then during the spring I invited her to a doubles soccer tournament at the beach, it even involved spending the night alone in my families house which never happened but she agreed.  We both were so excited.  That day might have been one of the best days of my life.  We hardly played any volleyball because we both aren't very good, but we just laied on the beach for all hours of the day, talking, creating stories, breathing life, and enthralled by each others company.  I didn't take this as a date just because I was going back to college over the summer and was kinda starting to talk to my current girlfriend.  Now fast-forward the summer, which was just me taking a bunch of summer classes.  I am dating my current so, Katie comes up a-lot in the conversation it seems like I am always bringing her up and notice a pattern of the me telling countless stories of us just being goofs and loving it together.  My girlfriend clearly notices this and is upset at Katie and deep down under I feel that she knows that I have feelings for her.  It clearly seems to put some animosity in are relationship that we awkwardly suppress. I just don't get the same feelings I do with my girlfriend as Katie.   When Katie found out that I was dating someone she appeared to be angry we stopped communication for a few days, but slowly picked back up.  We have made plans to get together over thanksgiving. I have no clue if she has feelings for me I suspect she does, but I am awful with women as you can see. 
 I need help desperately, I want to date Katie, she is absolutely perfect for me and likewise.  However, I am not a cheater and will not cheat on my GF.  Can I ask Katie over thanksgiving candidly, if she has feelings for me.  Explain the whole situation of why I am dating my GF and that I can't morally cheat but when we break up That I only want to be with you.  Do I not say anything about this until I do not have a significant other?  Additionally, since this is the first girl I dated I feel like people will laugh at me if I break up with her within a month...  If you watch the office I feel like my GF is Karen and Pam is Katie I am just kinda dating someone to relieve the pain temporarily.  If I could just have any kind of advice that would be great, and I am sorry I know I am the selfish one in this story.","Dating my girlfriend, In love with someone else, not sure if they like me, and they go to different school.

"Similar story, not told to me, but to my husband by an employee. This is an adult, too, not a child, so that rather ups the hilarity, in my opinion. 
 So this lady had a history of calling out sick all the time, leaving work early over supposed emergencies and in general being a shitty employee(my husband did not have the right to fire her or she would have been gone within a week; upper management refused to do anything about it). So they finally vaguely threaten to fire her and she shapes up for about a month. Then, three weeks ago, she tells my husband she needs to leave work early because she isn't feeling well and thinks she needs to go to the hospital. Husband think this is kind of odd since most people are pretty ill before a trip to the hospital is needed and she seems fine but whatever, he lets her go early.

She shows up the next day with forged doctor's notes.

 As long as I‘d known him he‘s been the type to go through short, intense bouts of depression where he will be very worked up feeling that he is worthless, and doesn‘t deserve to be happy and should just do everyone a favour and kill himself. He has laid in bed, holding me, crying and saying that there is so much wrong with him. Through this I have been patient, and supportive of him, trying my best to encourage him to get help- however, he is very reluctant to get any help or even admit that there is a problem. His reasoning varies from ‘I don‘t deserve help, I‘m useless anyways‘ to flat out denying his behaviour, later laughing it off and saying things like ‘what are you talking

"I’ll try to keep this brief. 
 So my SO (M30) and I (F23) are in a major rut.  I'm HL and he's LL.  We’ve been dating for about 2 years, and we're definitely each other's best friends, and I love him SO much.  When we first started dating we were really physical, and then after 5 months he moved for a job, and we did a long distance relationship for 9 months.  During that time our sexual relationship was (understandably) strained.  After I graduated last May I moved in with him.  I thought our sex life would get really exciting after going so long without each other. 
 On average I'd say we have sex 2-3 times a month, usually less.  I would like to be having sex 1-2 times a week, which I don't think is a lot. 
 We've talked about our sex life in excruciating detail many times. I know that one of his biggest issues is that his emotionally abusive ex-girlfriend tried to use sex to save their relationship, and he would kind of just go through the motions.  She would use it as proof that they loved each other.  So now sometimes when we're about to get intimate he gets really stressed out.  On top of that he had a few relatives pass away two years ago and he hasn’t had the time to deal with it. 
 So he naturally has a lower libido than me, and on top of that he's got like 3 years of really stressful circumstances that are wearing him down. 
 We've talked about him going to therapy, and he agrees that it would probably be helpful, just for him to get all of this stuff off of his chest.  But he agreed it was a good idea in November, and again when we talked in December and again when we talked last week.  I know that going the first time is scary, but he keeps putting it off.  He has insurance and we can afford it. 
 This stress of his is stopping him from approaching me.  I have to initiate sex every time.  And more often than not he just turns me down, and if we make it to the bedroom half the time he just freezes up.   We haven't had sex in 4 weeks.   It’s wearing me down, I want to feel sexy and desired and I just need to see that he’s doing something tangible to work toward feeling better.  I want him to do this so that we’re better together.  I want to see him less stressed out so that we’re a better couple.  I don’t want to resent him or the relationship.","My SO (M30) and I (F23) aren't having regular sex because he's stressed out.

"I'm 25, female, bisexual. 
 I used to dislike women. I was one of those nerdy tomboy girls. Buried in books, science experiments, and later in a computer. Growing up, I always preferred guys for friends. They were drama-free, objective, not easily distracted in arguments/discussions and knowledgable. They also didn't snigger behind your back for your stupid sleeves and didn't spend all their time talking about crushes. They didn't mind aggressive logic. I liked all of this and secretly disliked girls because they were often shallow, not very persistent when it came to acquiring skills, etc. 
 Except, I also had strong girl crushes. Go figure. 
 Anyway, at some point after I started working fulltime, all this started changing. Increasingly, I find that most guys are incurably shallow. They bitch about losing. They degrade women. They cling to a strange notion of toxic masculinity -- they are terrified of anything that might ""emasculate"" them (many straight guys I know have difficulty imagining themselves as gay in a hypothetical next birth). They boast about their sexual conquests. They are woefully ignorant and prejudiced about several things related to sex and women. Their band of curiosity is narrow. 
 At the same time, I'm starting to come across more and more cool women. Extremely intelligent, curious, insightful, fair (as in objective and interested in fairness), empathetic, fiercely logical, and so on. Even some of the stupid girls I knew -- not all, but some -- suddenly grew into women with whom I'd gladly be stuck in an abandoned island. 
 What's even worse is this: 
 I've started to believe, more and more, that a man and a woman could never replicate the intensity of the intimacy that can happen between two women. I feel like I can never cut past the fog in a man's mind, and he can never cut past the fog in mine. Men seem so incredibly uninterested in psychological intimacy. Or is it just the ones I've known? 
 (And by psychological intimacy, I do not mean sharing secrets or repeating your life history -- not that anything's wrong with that -- and what I do mean is unfortunately hard to describe...) 
 I've come to believe that women's minds and bodies are much more  complex  and interesting than men's. 
 There is one more thing. 
 I've always been able to easily brush off the constant male-oriented view of things. Not sexist things, you understand, just things where the writer/speaker assumes you are a straight white male. I'd brush it off and focus on the point of discussion. This is becoming harder and harder. I'm more and more  resentful  of that way of looking at the world. It's often said/done with no fault at all on the part of the writer/speaker but it still irritates me. 
 Take this short story for example --  Cathedral by Raymond Carver  and even that is  such  a trigger to me. I obsessed over every tiny objectifying/annoying thing he said about his wife. It's not the central point of the story but it's what took over my mind. 
 This is so stupid. I will be handicapped by this because it takes away my objectivity. Now with these diseased eyes, I view every  great author with suspicion. All of them seem to assume a male-oriented slightly-female-objectifying view of the world. This wouldn't matter, but I hate that I'm missing out on their great storytelling and writing because of my stupid hangup. 
 Anyway. Wall of text. 
 I'm somewhat ashamed of this. It feels great to finally write it out. 
 Also, I really  really  hope that I am utterly wrong, and I've just met a strange sequence of people in my life that has led me to this conclusion. Because I like the idea of the world having more interesting people rather than less.","boys were nice, girls were foolish, men became jackasses, women became awesome. fuck me.",25,F,confession
"Details:  I am 23, he is 25, been together 2 years.  We both had the hots for each other for a while before getting together and when we started dating things moved very fast and all was sunshine and puppies.  We both graduated last May (him master's, me undergrad) and moved to a new city together because I found a great job, and he has since been in and out of employment, returning to school for a semester, etc.  He is now employed but his job is not in his field and he is not very satisfied with it.  Since graduating our dynamic changed due to his employment situations (I have been supportive but careful not to be coddling), and also I tried BC for a while and it messed up with my hormones and I acted totally different than myself (crying a lot).  But recently our relationship has changed a lot. 
 I am going to preface this by saying I do NOT fish for compliments.  I do ask my boyfriend if he likes the way something looks on me so I will remember to wear it more often/less around him.  For such questions I don't expect more than a yes or no. 
 But, my boyfriend isn't great at giving compliments in general.  I will be dressed to the nines, hair done, smelling delicious, wearing something sexy, and he will glance at me and say without much enthusiasm ""You look cute/pretty/nice.""  I happen to think cute/pretty/nice is my default when I am not hungover or ill.  For instance, I was in the grocery store picking up his favorite beer before a date, and was dressed pretty sexy (for the date) and two guys whispered to each other ""Wow she is a 10!"" and when I got home my boyfriend glanced at me and said his typical ""You look nice.""  I have told him that I wished he used more superlatives, that they are indicative to me that he thinks I am something special.  His response is an eyeroll and ""I think you're gawwgeous"" in a voice not unlike the Linda Richman from the Coffee Talk skit on SNL.  I am effusive with compliments for him (I tell him he is so effing sexy/so fine I can't help but wait until I can fuck him/etc. because he IS the most attractive man I have met.)  I also equally compliment how funny and smart he is. 
 We have lived together for over a year and a half, so is that spark just gone? 
 Our sex life has also changed.  3 months ago I had a herpes outbreak I got from him (I have not cheated on him ever), so we didn't have sex for a month.  In the two months since we also haven't had sex but once a week (I have tried to initiate it but he has to wake up some mornings at 2:00 or 3:00 and by the time we make it to bed it is 10-11).  We used to have teh sex at least once a day.  Now typically the only time we have sex is when he initiates it (I would approximate at least 7/10 instances), and he does that by lying in bed and asking me to lay next to him and then he just starts taking my clothes off (not much sexiness, I just feel like I am a means to an end).  Also, when sexytime arises, he has been asking for BJs instead of sex, which I would willingly oblige (variety is the spice of life) but he does not go down on me (never has since we've been together), and I want to get off too. 
 Ok reddit, typing this out I have realized this is a bigger relationship issue than just wanting some compliments.

 24 male hwhite. Work at a call center $13.50 hr. Love helping people. Content with my situation. Well mannered. I'm common sense smart and ""worldly"" but not the guy who will cure the common cold or super aids.
Now to begin this journey. I have never bought from a dealership before in my life. Only 1 Craigslist deal back when I was 18 for a 2004 Chevy Cavalier. I spent $6,000 for it with only 35,000 miles on it. Great reliable car for cheap and low mileage. 
 Let us fast forward to present time. My girlfriend and I are about to be need 2 vehicles. My trusty cavalier now at 110,000 miles will be hopefully running another 5+ years with minimum repairs. And now I am attempting to purchase this 2011 ford ranger from a dealership. 40,000 miles only. Basic package. Sticker price 10,950. Runs great. 1 only, fleet on the car fax. Perfectly clean sold at auction. 
 I contact via email and offer if we can talk about getting it to the $8000-9500 range. Of course he wants to sit down. Doesn't dip below 10,600 and trys very aggressive sales tactic that I never would have for seen coming!
Multiply times I fucked up during our talks such as my budget and how much I could afford a month. My credit completely fine at 780. I had all the cards and lost them. But I never once was disrespectful in our convos.
But once I kept refusing the salesman left and this old man named dale came in. I belive he ws the owner or manager. He told me a Vietnam story and asked what was holding me up. I told him it was a 5 year loan I was taking upon myself and wanted to think about it and ask my dad. He than told me ""are you going to let your dad make all your decisions"" and than went on about a farm he bought and sold and lost money on just like this truck he was about to sellto me. 
 Shook his hand told him thanks but needed to think, sales man came back and tried a last attempt but no shake in price. Thanked him again told him for his time, I'd contact him in a few days regardless.
Now today I asked if again we could get closer to his price range and we'll I'll link the texts he sent me but felt so surprised. Maybe I was asking too much of a discount?!.

"Hey guys, 
 Just want some opinions if this would seem creepy/weird. (I'm a 26 male btw) 
 So I was at a bar last weekend with some friends and I was going to grab myself a drink so I asked the group if they wanted any. One of the girls in the group asked for another glass of Muscat, so I went to get the drinks but was told they ran out of Muscat and had to go to the resturant bar to order more. 
 I went to the resturant bar and there was this really cute girl behind the bar, I asked for the Muscat and she didn't look like she knew if they had and looked a bit confused, so she looked around and saw it on the top shelf, she's fairly short so she pulled a box over to stand on and I laughed, she turned and said ""If I fall over and have to get stitches I'm blaming you and you'll have to take me to hospital"". After she poured the glass she said it's $7 and asked if that's how much it was last time, I jokingly said it was only $5 last time while smiling and she laughed. 
 Later on that night she was at the main bar and came over to serve and then she saw it was me and says ""Oh it's you, I'm not serving you!"" and starts walking off as a joke but then comes back and serves me. I was planning on asking for her number a bit later in the night and after a bit more ""liquid courage"" but about half an hour later I saw her with her bag on her shoulder walking out the doors. 
 So my main question is would it be weird if I went back there next weekend, hopefully she'll be working again and as a joke asking for some Muscat (So she will remember who I am), and try and talk to her and get her number (but not make it look like I'm there just for that reason, friend and his wife said they'd come along to make it look like we are there for a few more drinks). I know I should have asked for it straight away instead of waiting and missing my opportunity, and I suck at picking up on girls flirting with me but looking back it sounds like she was flirting quite a bit! :-\",Bar girl flirting with me but finished before I could ask for her number.

"So I've never been in a relationship. Straight 26 year old European male, living in one of the largest cities in North America. 
 I'm halfway through a Ph.D in a theoretical science. I'm in great shape, I'm 6 foot 1, dress well, have been told by women that I'm very attractive. I play two instruments. I speak four languages. I practice a martial art. I love to cook and am quite good at it. I can hold a conversation easily, and smile often. I even garden (have a small place of my own with a tiny garden in front of it). I occasionally travel. I'm well-read, have watched a lot of popular shows (for conversational material) and know about a fair bit about current events. I volunteer every weekend. 
 Almost all of these things are things that I've done in the past several years in order to improve myself so that I could finally stop being alone. ""Become someone who people want to be around."" Well it hasn't worked. My loneliness is getting to the point of causing physical pain and other symptoms (consistent with clinical depression). If I can't find someone while mentally healthy, I can't imagine ever doing so while clinically depressed. But I just don't know what I can do. 
 The social trend in this city seems to be insular cliques. People don't really talk socially with strangers. Even at bars and parties people go in groups or pairs, and I feel extremely out of place being by myself with no other individuals there. When joining activity groups I have no issue forming superficial connections with people and getting along well for the purposes of that activity, but no one really takes much of an interest in me. I've asked some women out in case I was simply bad at reading romantic interest, but have been rejected every time. I've never been on a date. 
 I've tried online dating, but that was a soul-crushing experience in which I got tons of profile views, but no messages and no responses to any of my messages.

"My girlfriend (27F) and I (24M) had been dating for 18 months. When we met, she had a boyfriend that she told me she was planning on breaking up with. I fell for her hard and fast and when she broke up with him we were dating a week later. She is what I would consider my second real relationship and the true love of my life. 
 I won't claim that things were always perfect. We had our share of fights, but always made up. It always ended up with us reconciling and talking about our future together. When times were good, they were the best of my young life. She was my best friend. We had so much fun! I had never met a woman that I could go out drinking with, or just hang out, or make love and enjoy it all equally. I was and am very attracted to her. We both expressed desires to one day get married and have a family together. Which was a big deal for me. I never bought into the whole white picket fence and 2.5 kid nuclear family thing. She changed all that. 
 We were both honest to each other about our past histories. She told me that she had cheated on her previous boyfriend by getting fingerbanged by a guy. I told her the one thing I couldn't stand was infidelity. I've never understood my generation’s cavalier attitude towards sex. I've been with other women before her, and had trouble separating sex from emotion. I told her if she ever cheated on me, we would be done. It came up enough that she knew how I felt. 
About 2 or 3 months ago we got into a big fight. Talked about what our issues were with each other and decided to really work on them. After that, the last few months were the strongest of our time together. The best things had ever been. Our sex life was great, and we didn't argue nearly as much in the past. She seemed so happy, and I knew I was. 
 This last Friday we went to a social function with both of our parents and lots of friends. It's an annual thing in our community where everyone gets dressed up and listens to X-Mas music. Think prom with a lot more booze and middle aged people. The whole night she is weird and distant. Doesn't want to dance with me, sit with me etc. My friends and family noticed asking me if everything was okay. We went home separately. 
 The next day she wants to meet with me on my lunch break. When I show up she is sobbing in her car, she tells me she cares about me, but doesn't love me anymore. At least she doesn't love me like I love her. She tells me she isn't breaking up with me, she just needs a break. I asked several times if there was anyone else she was interested in. She swears up and down that there isn't anyone else, she just needs time to look at what she needs. 
 I call into work because I don't feel like crying in front of my coworkers and go home crushed. I gave it a couple hours and called her. I broke down, sobbed and begged for another chance. I received a definitive no. I asked if she was going out with her co-workers and friends and she said yes, but she won't see me. I decide to go crawl inside a bottle and try to give her space, believing we will make it work. 
 Cut to yesterday she calls me saying we need to meet. I meet her at a park and it's all over her face. She breaks down admitting she fooled around with the gym teacher at her school. When pressed, I came to find they went back to his place, made out for awhile and he fingerbanged her. This was especially painful for me on a few levels. One, she has always said she doesn't enjoy the feeling of getting fingered. Very rarely would she let me perform that particular sexual act, and it always ended with her asking me to stop. Two, this was the exact same scenario that played out in her previous relationship! She cried and begged me to forgive her. She told me it was different this time because she has never felt this way about anyone. I told her calmly to get the eff out of my car and left her sobbing in the park. 
 Since then she has continued to contact me asking for my forgiveness and another shot at our relationship. She said many times she would do anything to get back with me, will never betray my trust again. She offered to let me go through her phone and emails until I feel comfortable that she will remain faithful to me. Additionally, she promised I could dictate when and where she could go with her co-workers, because she works with the guy she messed around with. She even went so far as to offer to move away with me if I so chose. That was surprising because it was a point of contention earlier in our time together. She says she can't live without me. She told me that she will do anything to make us work. 
 At this point, I don't know what to do. I don't see me checking her phone and telling her not to go out with her friends resulting in a successful relationship. I want her to hurt like I do. I want to simultaneously never see her again and envelop her in my arms. I want to die, and I want to live, live up to my potential to show us both what she is missing. I can't help but still love her. Sorry for making this so long. Any advice would be appreciated.

"So, as stated, I'm a female. I'm twenty two years old. This is a throw-away account, of course. My boyfriend and I had been talking about trying anal (I told him I didn't really have any reservations. I have lots of friends who love it, and you can't knock it until you've tried it, right?) He enjoys being penetrated, himself, and I hope to get more than a finger in there in the future, so I thought it would be the perfect bargaining chip if I let him in the backdoor.

But when I tried to lube myself up with the stuff it burned like hell. ....Like...not in a pleasant melty way. Just...fucking....burning. But I continue, because I want to do this, and he's obviously hyped for it. We try for a good long time to get him in (because the lube burned, I didn't bother with much preparatory work...) but it just wasn't taking. Eventually, there's this sort of....silent pop. Like...all of the sudden he's through that first ring of muscle and I'm just like ""NOPE NOPE NOPE."" and I push him back and out. Then I tell him not to touch me for a bit because I need to have a little cry. It was bad. ...Still can't quite sit comfortably today.

"Okay, so I'm having trouble and I don't even know what to think, so I'm just going to start ranting and if you all can help in some way, that's be great. 
 I'm having a hard time enjoying sex right now. My girlfriend (19) and I (20) have been together for several months now and we've been having sex the past 2 months, give or take. Well lately, I've not been enjoying sex that much. I'm still attracted to her, I still get urges, but the sex seems tedious. 
 First off, I've been very stressed recently. I'm an actor at our university and just got done putting up 3 seperate shows. I'm soon to start another 2 as well, then a final show soon as those two are over. It's been extremely stressful and tiring and I just don't have the energy for sex. 
 Second, I feel she's not pulling her weight as much anymore. She's constantly horny (she has the sex drive I should have) and always wants me. However, she usually wants me to do the work. I'm happy to be in charge sometimes, but I'm tired and stressed and can barely focus anyway. 
 Third, and probably the biggest thing. I can't seem to please her any more. Not long ago, I used to be able to rock her consistently. We had a particularly fun day once when I gave her 16 orgasms. But now, I've not given her 1 in weeks. And any time I try, she either stops me from pain or because she wants to ""focus on me"". Don't get me wrong, I'd be happy with that normally, but I want to give her at least one each time or I feel like a failure. It's no fun if it's just me getting off, I might as well just masturbate. 
 It's getting frustrating and starting to effect our relationship. So please, just some advice would be nice. I getting fed up!","Stressed, can't please girlfriend, not pleasing to me either, starting to effect relationship. Help!",20,M,sex
"I'm a male, raised from dope house to dope house by an addict mother and a series of violent addict step-fathers.  That wasn't traumatic enough I guess, so being a combat medic (I was told I would be a non-combatant, wouldn't have to carry a gun: perhaps there is some moral injury to my trauma as well) in the US Army sounded like a good idea (enlisted pre-Iraq war).  Then Operation Iraqi Freedom kicked off and they sent me there.  That wasn't traumatic enough (and all of my leadership told me the army was the only place for me and that I would fail in civilian life), so I re-enlisted to go back to Iraq a couple more times.  That was finally traumatic enough for the Army at least, so they kicked me out on a pension and I went to college to study photojournalism.  I studied photojournalism so that I could take pictures of just how traumatic war is, because I thought that it was important that everyone know just how traumatic war is.  Thinking that I couldn't become more traumatized, I returned to Iraq, bouncing between there and Syria as a journalist and humanitarian aid worker.  I was finally traumatized enough and decided to take a vacation in lovely Germany...  However a working vacation, documenting traumatized refugees of the ongoing civil wars in Iraq and Syria. 
 In Germany I met the woman of my dreams, literally.  I'd had an image of what that girl was since I was 12 years old: dark skin, dark hair, and bright, sparkling personality.  We fell in love quickly, and I gave up my obsession with constantly re-traumatizing myself, giving up my idea of being a war photographer.  I decided to take a sabbatical and re-determine a course of life that could work with hers.  During this sabbatical I began taking lots of psychedelic drugs along with her.  I felt it was a cool new way of us bonding at first, but it just eventually became my escape from trauma.  I would take drugs at every possible interval and would become emotionally volatile, especially to her.  We live in a 36 square meter, one room flat on a loud party street.  Tensions rose, especially when we couldn't afford drugs and partying.  When we could, everything was great.  Eventually we decided to marry, and did though we had only known one another and been together for a year and change. 
 Fast forward a few months and a few massive panic attacks later, she convinced me to get off of drugs and seek therapy.  I did and just recently received this diagnosis of Post Traumatic Personality Disorder, which from what I have read is supposed to be somewhere between Complex Traumatic Stress Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder, coming from a lifetime of unchecked trauma. 
 This diagnosis scares the shit out of me, and I'm hoping that I can overcome the supposed BPD portion of it.  Every article I've read on BPD in males is so absolutely damning.  I'm not looking for a mother.  Though I've had a significant number of partners, romances and micro-romances, it is likely because I have been super busy in my life with little time for long-lasting relationships, I am happy with just this one amazing woman who is now my wife.  I am guilty of thrill-seeking behavior and drug-abuse.  I am impulsive.  I am in so many ways way more ""all or nothing"" than what is within normal boundaries.  My wife is driven mad and calls me a drama queen, to which I often sling back insults.  I have cheated, as has she in a period where we had a very complicated open relationship. 
 I have a plan for the road ahead at least: stay clear-headed, remain as stress-free yet engaged as possible, psychotherapy, couples therapy, medication as a stop measure for panic attacks and flashbacks, volunteer work until and perhaps even after I get my work permit for here in Germany, actual work, saving for a larger flat with more at least three rooms, structure, schedule, exercise, diet.

But that probably doesn't help, I suspect. You really need to talk to someone that can help you make sense of all this. 
You might have clinical depression, my wife did, and need some pill of restore your neurotransmitter levels (my wife suffered from SAD and needed a course for 12 weeks to get back to normal, now we just go away in the winter for a few weeks). Again, you need to talk to a medical doctor.

 We had an excellent relationship for most of the 3 years, and we were talking about maybe getting married and plans like that. We both had stable jobs, and things were looking pretty good. Then, driving to my apartment one day from work, I was smashed by a truck running a red light (or so I'm told). I don't actually remember it, it is just sort of a gap in my memory. I suddenly came to 2 days later in a hospital bed, where I learned I had broken 17 bones and would not be able to leave the hospital for months. 
 My girlfriend never came and visited me even once during the 5 months I was there, and I even had some family members call her phone, but she seemingly had just vanished. I was heartbroken. But after returning home, I found expensive equipment missing from my apartment: my TV, laptop, iPad, and other items. I was confused and I spent a while tracking her dad's cellphone number down in phone books. When I called him, she answered and cursed me out for ""leaving"" her after I got in the crash. Apparently she thinks I abandoned her by being confined to a hospital bed for months. She told me she smashed all my expensive shit in a rage.

"I apologize for the length. There's a lot to explain. 
 Susan (34f) and I (32f) met in college. We were both freshman but older than your average college student. We took to each other immediately and became very close very quickly. We had so much in common and we were both eager for friendship. For about four years everything was lovely. We even became roommates at year two. Our friendship had a very even give and take to it. We had endless inside jokes, we laughed until our sides hurt every day, and we could practically read each other's minds. 
 But around year five of our friendship things started to go badly. Susan's anxiety became serve, she became demanding, petty, and flat out mean. Now, Susan was always someone who would at least attempt to get someone else to do the things she didn't want to do but by year five I was making her coffee on a daily basis (even though I don't drink it), making any phone calls she needed to make (i.e. doctors appointments, calling out of work, etc), and paying most of our household bills myself because anytime I approached her about money it resulted in me being  screamed  at. When I talked to her about this she said she wasn't angry at me, she was just angry about having to pay bills. Nonetheless, the screaming was unpleasant. She would also say and do purposefully hurtful things all the while blaming me, saying that I had an indefinable ""attitude"" towards her that made her act that way. 
 Anyway...we finally (mercifully) went our separate ways when she moved in with her boyfriend and I moved in with mine. We both got engaged, Susan married Patrick about six months ago. 
 Susan seemed to think that our friendship could continue as normal the minute she moved out but I was hurt and so fucking angry at her behavior that I basically shut her out and didn't speak to her for about 18 months. 
 A few weeks ago she texted me, we hashed some things out, and began rebuilding a friendship. And then last week, Patrick died very suddenly. Susan watched him die in their bed as they waited for the EMTs. It was absolutely awful. 
 Since then I have been doing everything I can to help her. I picked her up from the hospital after he died and stayed with her until late that night. The next morning I drove her to the funeral home to ID his body. The day after that I organized a get together with two of our other old friends and spent hours at her house. Yesterday I went to the funeral (which was supposed to be family only) to support her. Then I went to the memorial service. I had to go back to work today but on my days off she is expecting me to spend all my free time with her so she doesn't have to be alone. 
 And hey...I get it. The worst thing in the world just happened to her and she's devastated. She doesn't have anyone else and I want to be there for her. But I'm also wary of repeating our past. Both my fiancé and my mother have cautioned me that she'll probably try to wiggle her way back into my life full time and manipulate me and make demands on me like she used to. My fiancé said he already sees it happening (for example, she didn't ask me to accompany her to the funeral. I learned I was going when I overheard her say to someone else ""PutUponBestie is going with me""). 
 I'm in the middle of very busy few weeks. My wedding is in less than a month and I'm in the process of applying for a new job with a very long, involved application process.

When the divorce first happened, I visited both parents fairly equally, however, over time I began visiting my mom less and less (didn't like her apartment/eventual house, and absolutely hated the douchebag she married). By the time this happened, I was only visiting her on holidays. 
 So at the time, I was just getting over a pretty bad case of pneumonia. Now I had noticed before how kinda crazy my mom was (once threatened to throw my sister's phone onto the road because she was texting her fiance during some holiday dinner. Keep in mind my sister was like 22 at the time.) While I was in the hospital, I overheard my mom complaining to some nurses or whatever about the fact that my step mom was the one who took me to the hospital. Like what the hell. I don't see what the problem with that is since she cared enough to take off work and get me to the hospital and everything. 
 As I was saying, getting over pneumonia, so on this Friday night my sisters were going over to my mom's for the weekend, as they do every other weekend. As they are walking out the door, my mom texts me saying that I need to come spend the weekend with her. So I kindly decline since I don't like being over there and don't even have a room at her house. So what does she do? 
 She texts me saying something along the lines of it's not up to me, basically trying to force me (15 at the time) into going with her. So she takes my sisters to her house, then she texts me again saying that she's coming back for me. Now at this point I've locked myself in the room, thinking what the hell is happening right now. Now apparently, I later found out from my dad that she had texted him saying that I was going with her that night. My dad, knowing I never spend the night there, assumed she was just taking me to a baseball game or something and ran out to pick up my prescription, to help me deal with the cough from pneumonia. 
 So now my dad and step mom are basically wondering what the hell is going on as well. So I continue to keep myself locked in my room and tell them that she's trying to force me to go with her. Now at this point, I'm not sure exactly what happened, but I expect my dad basically went outside with one of his guns and scared them off, cause that is definitely something he would do. 
 After maybe 15 minutes my dad came back into my room and basically told me that my mom and step dad were gone and literally said no one would be able to make me go if I didn't want to cause he's a badass. 
 After what happened, I just hated my mom so much. To this day, I have not spoken a word to her or replied to any of her texts. Luckily, she very rarely texts me anymore (the last time was to congratulate me on getting my license) and I just ignore it. She permanently ruined my relationship with her and I don't think it will ever be fixed.","mom / step dad try to force me to go over to their house, i refuse, dad scares them off with gun, haven't talked to mom since.",15,M,LetsNotMeet
"I don't think that it warrants joining the forever alone bandwagon. 
 For some background story: last year I dated a 27 year old guy (I was 20 at the time). I was finishing my sophomore year of college and he was finishing his masters degree after returning to school from industry. We were both MechE (a major without a lot of females) and in the same research group. It wasn't until after a month of dating did he tell me that he had never had a girlfriend and was a virgin. It didn't really matter to me; he was a great guy, cook, lover, and mentor. 
 Things went horribly wrong once school ended. Summer came and I decided to break it off since long distance wasn't working. This is when he proceeded to freak out. He was determined that I would be the only girl for him and that we were going to get married, etc. I'm still young and not ready for those things. His freak out evolved into some sort of sick obsession which ended in me barely talking to him since.","don't think that your first girlfriend will be your wife.

"If NSA lists exist, many of us who would even answer a question like this have probably done things in the past that warrant our placement on them. 
 So here I go.....any move by the federal government to take away civilian firearms, civil liberties, coupled with a poor economy and overt attacks upon ""subversive"" (read: freethinking) elements, especially those controlled by labor, during a war that involves mainland fighting would probably cause violent revolts. I would definitely join if I don't have a family at the time because, let's face it, young men don't care much for safety when excited. 
 Notice how many of these circumstances are similar to what happened during WWI, minus the poor economy and mainland fighting. Now take into account the Russian Empire during the same time. Guess what they had..... 
 What would happen? If the American government is still as strong then as it is now, all rebellion has a good chance of being wiped off the Earth while the government cries about patriotism and DemocraticChange™. If it is weakened by war (like Czarist Russia) or if the revolting masses get external help (like the Partisans in WWII), then there's a chance for success. Even though most historical changes have happened on the backs of revolutions, we are purposely not taught the true dynamics of past revolts....unless you study that topic in higher acedemia.

When I was 16 I had sex with my friends mom. At first I was terrified. Losing my virginity to a 32 year old woman and waking up to her daughter yelling. Sheesh. When I got home I counted 18 hickeys from my neck to my chest. Scratched up on my back and arms. My parents noticed a few hours after I had been home. I told them I had did it with my friends cousin.

"So basically if you told me last year that I would throw away my social life for video games I would punch you in the dick and get the whole 200 kids that went to my school to come laugh at you. I am 14 years old and live in a small town in Ontario of like 5000 people, and basically everyone plays hockey. Of course I was one of those kids and TBH I was one of the better hockey players out there which of course put me on the popularity charts. I was the star of my old school, but it only goes up to grade 6, so after that we move up to ""the big school on the hill."" It's not a big deal because everybody knows everybody no matter what school you went to so that means that everyone knew I was no force to be triffled with. The end of grade 7 was when I started playing lots of computer. There was this kid in my class who didn't go to my old school and I had no idea who he was so I started talking to him and he was actually really smart. We both found out we play computer games (I only really played minecraft with 
. who wanted to play with me before) but then he introduced me to Steam. It was wonderful! All these games!! Me and this kid I had never talked to in my life all of the sudden became bestest of friends through the computer. Everybody else thought he was a nerd and thought the only real video game out there was CoD. One day me and this boy were looking through steam to find any Co - op games that we could play for free because we were both broke and we stumbled upon Dota 2. I never played any sort of MMO or MOBA or anything with wizards and warlock and what not. I remember my first game like it was yesterday. I thought that the person I picked would be my permanent character and I had to chose wisely, so I clicked the random button. I was Bristleback. The hedgehog? I wasn't really satisfied with my pick but whatever I entered the game. We were radiant but that didn't matter because I didn't know either sides of the map. We had to buy items and I thought that what ever item we bought would like cosmetically change my character so I bought some boots. I'm not really sure how the game went and I actually didn't really like it that much so I unistalled it so I could play a different game on my computer (it's really shitty and has no memory). It sat in my steam library still and after watching many YouTube videos, I decided I'd give it another shot. (TY Purge) I was actually pretty decent at the game thanks the Purge but I still new nothing about the game or that there was a pro scene and people actually make money off of it. By that point I had spent way to much time inside and I had ditched to many sleepovers playing Dota so slowly but surely I sank far from the top of my school, which I now give 0 shits about. After learning that Arteezy is only 18 and from Canada (not meaning to make this an EG fan boy post) I knew that I could actually have a shot playing Dota.

"Background: We've been going out for a little longer than two years.  We are both 18 and I'm the guy.  I asked her out on her birthday since we were going to college together but  lived in separate sides of the state.  The first year was pretty magical but I guess it started to deteriorate.  Yes, we fought a lot over stupid things and have broken up a few times but only for a few days. 
 I don't have enough money to live on campus during the summers so I don't see her alot during the summer.  I finally book a ticket to see her since I wanted to take her to the Cedar Point because its been her dream since she was little.  A week later she breaks up with me since she's tired of all the fighting.  I finally get it out of her later on that someone kissed her on the lips for three seconds but she didn't pull away.  Obviously its just done right there and here I am ranting against it.  She said she couldn't do it afterwards and was kicked the guys apartment apparently... i don't know the details since I didn't want to ever talk to her again.  She still likes hanging out with him and plans to hang out with him still... I don't get how someone can just throw it all away. 
 My question is how can people just throw away 2 years of their life so quickly?  We were always together for each other, even if through the bad times... there were no signs of her ever liking anyone else...

"Background: I'm 22, college grad, and working as a scientist a few hundred miles from home. My little sister just finished high school, is 18, and will attend a local state university while living at home this coming semester. We're incredibly different people. She's quite popular, runs with the BMX/hardcore crowd, and is generally involved in rifraf activities - smoking ganj, drinking vodka, staying out too late. I can't say that wasn't me four years ago, but my priorities were a hell of a lot straighter. The main difference between us is she identifies with her friends: I was just an associate. 
 The problem: my sister threatened to hurt herself over her boyfriend being with his (crazy) ex. When my mom got the call from my sister saying this she immediately left work. Being 22, out of the house, and generally removed from my family life and affairs, I don't know if I'm being invovled or supportive enough for her. Not being there for her has been a struggle, but I need to live my own life and grow up too.

"I dated this girl i met in college for 2 years straight. 
The only reason we broke up was because she was older and graduated and had to move back to VA, I was in MA at the time. 
 We were literally the perfect couple and she was my absolute best friend. We dated on and off for about 2 years while we were away from each other, but I can honestly say i never stopped loving her, even though I had my hook ups here and there. 
 The morning after my hookups i would be sick to my stomach thinking about how it wasn't with the person i loved. 
 I tried to reconnect with her recently (about 3 months ago) and it worked. We were back to talking, and exchanging the ""i love you"" text back and forth, until about 4 weeks ago. 
 She stopped contact with me and wouldn't even text me back when i told her I missed her. 
 Welp.... i got a call from her yesterday. 
 Apparently, she got pregnant with some random dude down in VA where she lives. 
 She says it was a one night stand, but i don't know how much to believe that. either way, it was a random hook up and not genuine which kills me even more. He wanted her to get an abortion but for unknown reasons, she's keeping it. 
 Mind you i was just in the hospital about a month ago for a collapsed lung and i can honestly say i have NEVER felt this much pain before. 
 The girl I have truly loved for about 4 years now, is having a baby...... and the father isn't supporting her. 
 I cannot begin to even explain the emotions I'm currently having.
Greif; Anger; sadness; mental(crazy) and alone. 
 I have never been more crushed in my life.
I think i could handle it if she were just dating someone else, because in my mind we could be together when that fling was over, because to be honest, I ALWAYS saw myself getting back together with her if that meant i had to move to VA. 
 i actually have been currently looking for jobs in her surrounding towns without her knowing to try and be closer to her. But thats out the window. 
 It its absolutely heart breaking for me to think and realize i will NEVER be with the girl again. I just cannot look at her the same way after this. Its hard because all i want to do is look at her. 
 All i want to do is text her and ask her so many questions but i know that will just bring up past emotions and memories i really want to bury. 
 I deleted my Facebook, twitter and unfollowed her on instagram to try and delete any and all social media connections with her. Because i know, even viewing a picture of her will trigger all those emotions again. 
 I can truly say I thought this girl was my soulmate. 
 I havent cried in 2 years, and for the first time in my life, i cried myself to sleep last night. Im shaking and about every hour, i burst into tears. I can't control it. 
 She was more than my girlfriend, she was my BEST friend.
I guess you can say I'm just disgusted with her, as well as mad, upset and just plain out disappointed. 
 I really thought she thought the same about me, about hopefully getting back together one day. But i guess i was wrong. 
 Im Still madly in love with this girl and this is the hardest thing i've ever experienced in my life.
Its the hardest to try and understand that this is not the same girl i fell in love with. She's gone, which tears me apart. 
 I can't sleep, i try and stay active but when i hit the gym, all i think about is her with anger, then when i leave i cry in grief. 
 Everytime i close my eyes i see her. Whenever I'm alone all i think about is her. This pain seems everlasting 
 I could honestly type forever about this girl but I would loose your interest - thats if you even have any. 
 I just needed to vent and let SOMEONE know my feelings because i know keeping them in will literally kill me.

"I've been with my LDBF for almost a full 4 years now. We'll both be 23 by the end of September. He lives in England, and I live in the USA. 
 We met online and have visited each other at least twice a year every year since we met, staying together each time for a few weeks. Our longest was 2 months. Typical is 3 weeks. Total time spent physically together is about 31 weeks (almost 8 months). 
 I've graduated college now and will begin working tomorrow as an engineer. My BF graduated college with a math degree and works as an analyst. I think we both have a small chance of being able to seek employment in the other's country, but it will be difficult and unlikely. I am concerned that our limited schedule overlap starting tomorrow will cause us to drift apart. 
 I really believe we are excellent partners, and we love each other wholly. I therefore want to move in together ASAP. 
 Based on the sheer unlikelihood of getting a legal job in the other's country any time soon, our fastest and easiest route would be through a fiance visa, which would then require us to get married within 90 days. So we could move in together within a year-ish, but it requires getting married. 
 I've always cut that line of thinking there, because I want to be  positive  that I'm marrying someone I want to live with for the rest of my life. I don't think I can be positive without living with him for at least a few months, and we can't do that without pausing one of our careers for that entire time. 
 I'm now questioning what is really at risk if we were to get married and move in together. If we somehow grew to hate each other, we would be risking the cost of divorce. We may also be risking our relationship if we commit to something we're not emotionally ready for. But I think our relationship will be at risk if we maintain the distance with such little time to spend together. 
 What am I missing? Would this be reckless? We have discussed it, and we both intend to marry the other eventually.

"This happened when I was 12-13 and I am reluctant to post it because I'm still affected by the event. Sorry if I make any mistakes, I just want to get this over with and excuse the length. I will add a map to help visualize. 
 When I was in middle school, my older sister (5 years older) had a baby girl and she quit high school. One day my older sister and I had to go pick up my younger sister (1 year younger) who was in middle school at the time. We walked there; we lived in a not-so-nice part of the city. We picked her up and I was pushing my niece in stroller. We passed by a KFC and I went inside to order a couple of smoothies before we walked home. When i went back outside, my sisters were in a discussion with a man ( I am really wary of men because of another situation so I was immediately scared of him). 
 Once the man left, I asked my sister what was going on and she said that while they were waiting a man past by them while running and a thick gold chain fell from his pocket; my sisters picked it up and yelled after him that it fell but the man kept running. 
The man who they were talking to was a witness and told them that if my older sister gave him her necklace she could keep the one she found. My older sister agreed (my sisters are not the smartest cookies). 
 Anyways the man said he would bring them money and then return her necklace so we waited for 10 minutes. I told my sister she was an idiot and that the man wasn’t coming back. We saw that the man had turned a corner (we were along a busy intersection and the man had gone into a smaller street). We agreed that we would go see if the man was there and that he could keep the thick necklace if he returned my sister hers. 
So we walked and stood at a corner and I noticed that in front of the street there was a house full of gang bangers (3 of them stood out because they kept watching us). I’m starting to get really terrified (upset stomach, cold sweat, etc) and I tell my sisters that we should just leave.  They insist that we wait for 5 more minutes and I give in. 
 I keep furtively glancing at the house full of cholos and they are just full on glaring at us. All of a sudden they get in their car and do a move straight out of a movie. We freeze and see that their car is heading at us at about 60-70mph so we scream and run to a store (LADY of the map) and tell her than some men are harassing us. 
At this point my older sister is hysterical because she’s with the baby and they tried to run us over. So the three men come into the store and start telling the lady that nothing is going on and we’re screaming that they tried to kill us. The lady happened to know them and told them that they should leave. They left but not before glaring menacingly at us and grinning. The lady sees that my sisters are a crying so she offers to drive us home and we obviously accept. While in the car she told us that they’re usually not like that. She dropped us home and told us to take it easy. 
 Looking back I honestly believe that they were trying to kill us and that the man who took my sisters necklace was involved with them, but seriously what kind of fucked up person sees three girls with a baby as a threat? 
Nowadays I avoid that street at all costs and I can’t trust any man. I almost stabbed a guy with a chopstick because he got too close to me. Those BASTARDS made me paranoid.

"I'm sure you guys get this question a lot. I have been lurking for a long time, as well in /r/relationships and /r/deadbedrooms. I even dabbled in /r/askwomen. Lurking and reading links, tips etc has been somewhat helpful, but I am so at a loss! I need help. 
 I have an almost non-existent libido. I so  want  to want to have sex. Sex fascinates me, I read about it, try and find visual stuimulation etc. It sometimes turns me on, but not as much as everyone else. I know why, let me explain it to you. 
 I am a 20 something female, currently at a considerably low stress job with very little things in my life to worry about (I get paid decently, my rent is cheap, I have few bills, I take online classes in a field that I am very educated in (so while decently challenging, I enjoy the learning and feel very little pressure). Sorry if this seems like I'm bragging, I'm just saying I'm pretty much as non-stressed as a college student can be.) I eat healthy, I am at a normal weight, I am in a healthy relationship with a 20 something male (who I live with).  Here's the two major problems: 
 1) I was raped as a teenager. I've read it goes either way with rape vctims, either they get very hyper sexual or get a very low libido. I got lucky enough to be very sensitive to sex. If one thing is done wrong I am turned off not for the night, not for the day but something, and often  for the entire week.  It's fucking bananas. If a partner touches me in such a way (through no god damn fault of their own, how could they possibly know my ridiculously long list of triggers, right?) that I dislike or find triggering/bring up bad memories I just don't want them to touch me at all. It becomes a desert down there. 
 2) I was diagnosed with depression as a teenager,  I have been seeing a therapist for almost a year  and am in the process of being rediagnosed. Right now, it is some sort of depressive disorder, but the main theory my therapist has is an anxiety disorder. Basically, my brain gets anxious/scared and so it decides to squash those negative and scared thoughts by ""depressing"" me to calm me down. So, awesomely enough, if something scares me  I know, I know. I need professional help, and I promise you I am getting it!  The problem is, while I have made leaps and bounds with my weird depression disorder and trauma, my sex drive has not changed. 
 You may be thinking, could it be the boyfriend? It's not. It's always been like this with every partner I've had. I'm not prude by any stretch of the imagination (mostly me trying to figure out why the hell I just don't want sex), and no one I've been with I've particularly felt the amount of lust It seems all the other people I talk to/read about have. 
 Sex is pretty much always the last thing on my mind. Before this week, it had been two months since I last masturbated. My boyfriend and I have sex about once a week, mostly because I feel it's unfair to him to trap him in a relationship without sex. I am  very  attracted to him, why don't I want to have sex with him or anyone else?? What the hell body?? 
 Like I said, this week I have been trying to masturbate a lot more. Even though I don't really get the  urge  to masturbate, I still do because it seems to raise my libido a bit more than normal. 
 So my question to you is how can I raise my libido more in a way that I will actually crave sex/get horny? I can;t even tell you the last time I got horny without a very long time of foreplay, uhg. Yes, I know some are going to tell me to talk to my therapist and trust me, I have. We have been working with it. Her main theory is hopefully to just continue focusing on depression/trauma and the libido will follow suit. Not quite yet the case. Possibly I need to be more patient? Is there anything else I can do? 
 Sorry if this a confusing post, I'm nervous/a little tipsy because I needed to get up the courage to post this...","Super low libido. Sex seems like a chore with no matter who it is.

"Forgive me if this is long, but this needs a bit of a back story. I'm a 25 year old guy (about to be 26 in a month) and have been looking to move out of my parents' house for awhile, and I finally have the funds to be able to do it. 
 Here's where things get tricky: in the past I've talked with both of my parents about moving in with my girlfriend of 6 years, but both are extremely disapproving of it. We have a great relationship and when we were attending the same college, we pretty much lived together anyway, so I don't have any worries about anything going wrong in that aspect. In my area, I could get a small, single bedroom apartment and live by myself - but I would be really stretching myself financially. However, if I lived with her and we were to share the bills, we would both be able to live pretty comfortably. 
 Her parents have no problems with us living together. Her mom was actually surprised when my girlfriend told her that my parents were so disapproving. I guess I'm just afraid of hurting my mom - she's not really religious but has some really weird old-fashioned viewpoints. I've tried to have multiple discussions with her about it and tried to present my side calmly and in the best way possible, but it usually ends with her saying ""I don't want to talk about it"" after 10 seconds of me speaking. 
 I guess my question would be - at what point do you just say forget it and bite the bullet and move out, no matter what your parents say? My girlfriend and I have been fortunate enough to find good jobs out of college, so we're financially stable with a decent amount in savings. Both our cars are paid off and we're able to pay student loans with no problems. Has anyone been in a similar situation where their parents didn't approve of their plans to move out?

"Back in 1997 I tried to migrate my slackware box from using [libc5 to glibc]( So, anyway, after I hosed my box, I decided to see what else was out there. I'd been using Slackware since 1993 and hadn't really investigated other options at that point. 
 I loaded a bunch of different distros, but settled on Debian because it made adding software so easy. Just apt-get install whatever. This was especially helpful because of the amount of work required to get my 3dfx card working with Quake in 1998.

"After six months of unemployment, my girlfriend ""Angela"" took a new job at a very trendy hair salon in the city. Hot chicks and gay guys everywhere. I'd usually go there during my lunch break and bring her coffee while she worked, and soon enough I became a mainstay at the salon. All of the girls liked me and soon I became ""Coffee Brad"". 
 Then I got to know some of the other stylists there. One of them, a very flamboyant guy I'll call ""Mark"", started to become very friendly with my girl, and she started going to the bar with him and other coworkers. No big deal, I shrugged. More football and Breaking Bad in my boxers. 
 Then, the nights became later and started to turn into sleepovers. Now, mind you, Mark was  flamingly gay. His wrists were flimsier than a silk sheet, and even the other guys in the place were annoyed with him; one guy even joked that he was setting gay people back 50 years.

I didn't think Mark had it in him, as he was, well, gay. I texted her; nothing. I walked around all of the diners and coffee places; I don't see them. I got frustrated and headed back to the salon, where one of the girls is having a smoke in back. I asked her where Angela was, and she sort of just chuckled. 
 ""Probably screwing Mark,"" she said. We both laughed; none of us entertained the possibility. By then it was almost one and I had to go back to the office. I excused myself and walked into the bathroom for a quick leak, and then I saw them: my girlfriend and her gay coworker, stark naked and going at each other. I slammed the door and I panted heavily. I had a mini-panic attack. There was my woman, the love of my life, cheating on me with her coworker, her GAY coworker at that. He scampered out of the bathroom while hastily throwing on his henley onto his dainty body, and I confronted her. I loved you, you betrayed me, how could you do this, that sort of thing. She started crying and begged me to stay with her. I told her she was nuts and that I'd have her stuff on the front lawn when she got home. 
 I get home, grab all of her clothes, shoes, makeup, anything that was remotely feminine and threw it onto the front lawn. I wanted to burn the place down, but it was my place. She comes home, holding her heels in her hand like she was stumbling out of a bar at 2 AM, and the mascara is running down her cheeks. She starts crying and tells me to stay, but my heart is hardened and after everything I gave her, I wasn't giving an inch. She cried and said she had no money to go back home to Montana, and I asked her how much she needed. 
 ""About tree fiddy,"" she said. 
 It was about that time I realized that my new ex-girlfriend was a seven-story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era. I couldn't believe my luck, and I told her to go to hell, as I wasn't giving her no damn tree fiddy. I chased her away with a broom and never saw her again. 
 Eventually I met a new girl, Jane, and things are going remarkably well. I've never been happier, and it feels good not to be lied to by a woman, or anyone, really.","Girlfriend cheated on me with gay coworker, discovered an even darker secret.",20,M,AskReddit
"So my GF(F,18) and I (M,19) decided that on my trip back home from University that we were ready to lose our virginities to one another. Both of us had a good amount of experience with oral and everything before this relationship but neither of us have felt ready to have actual intercourse with someone until this point. So on Friday we have our first time and it's fun but due to time restrictions didn't last very long. During Saturday afternoon she comes over and we have sex for an hour..It was very surprising to me because even with the intensity she wasn't in pain(she said just a bit when I went all the way in), and we tried multiple positions (also something I was surprised worked so well the first time). Anyways I drop her off to hang out with a few of my friends before spending the night at her house and end up smoking quite a bit of weed. I show up to her place high as a kite and we get it on right away. Here's where the concerns begin, we go at it for 30 minutes and I noticed my dick wasn't getting hard as it usually gets but it's just hard enough to work and all goes well and i cum. Usually after I cum it takes me only about 10-15 to get hard again. But it took much longer and even after blowjob/handjob my dick wasn't getting hard enough to able to go in again. It was kinda hard but would bend. So I end up cumming two more times with my oddly not hard enough dick from her help. I figure we can sleep and wake up and I'll be all hard like I normally am. I wake up and same not being able to get hard enough situation. I thought maybe it was just the weed causing the ED but i had done sexual things before while high and had no problems.. before this I have never had any problems being able to get hard, I've had nights with her before where she would make me cum 4 times throughout the night and no problems with hardness. It's now Sunday and I'm back on campus and my dick hurts (which it has before the morning after a night of it being tugged) and it still feels off. I try to get hard in the shower and it's the same situation! I'm very concerned and something about it feels so off. She's planning on coming up this weekend and I'm nervous that this will still be a problem. I have jerked off more than normal leading up to this past weekend ( once day sometimes 2 times) but I've done more in the past and had no problems. Could this be a desensitized issue? I'm so confused and don't plan on touching my dick all week. Sorry for the wall of text, I've been a member of this subreddit for over a year now and have learned so much from you guys (communication is a key theme here and that helped me get her to have multiple clitoral orgasms) can you guys help tell me what could be going on?","My GF and I had sex for the first time this weekend, after having sex 2 times I smoke and return to her and have a problem getting fully erect, it gets worst after sucessful sex twice, ED is  something that has never happened before.

"By any chance, does anyone close to you suffer from alcoholism? 
 Let me just start off by saying that  may  a much bigger impact on you than you would think. 
 If not, than let me say that going to counseling is not a bad idea. You could listen to helpful suggestions, such as 'fake it till you make it' that many will comment about, but I find them to be conventional advice to the average Joe. What is best advice to you is probably from a professional specialized to folk like you who desire change, but who also do not know the best approach for the change. 
 I, 23 and male, too am an introvert and never have had a serious relationship. As someone suggested,  the feeling of 'faking it' makes it as feel 'plastic' is all too familiar. Going to counseling has led me to confront issues with my family and reasoning for my social issues: why I don't connect with people socially, why I'm overtly anxious when I'm with a crowd of strangers, why I am alone and I don't have many close friends. The therapy itself has led me to a new perspective of life. I prefer not to get in the details of 'why' my life is the way it is (because I can go on and on) 
 The point I'm trying to make is that maybe, just maybe, your 'last piece of your puzzle' isn't what you stated, maybe something different.","Of all the advice here, though helpful, counseling may be the best step to get you on the path on where you want to go in life.

"Need advice 
 I’ve been going into an english class every Wednesday evening since two and a half years now. A month ago a girl joined our class and I immediately had a crush on her. For me she looks just like perfect and has a style which I really like. Even though she’s about the same age as me (I don’t know how old she exactly is) she has already moved out with some friends. I kind of admire her because she just did that move spontaneously. 
 I tried to talk as much as possible with her and we had some really nice conversations about random things and school. I somehow know that she kind of likes me because she also try’s to talk with me as much as possible and always smiles at me when we look at each other. 
 Now to the question: What should be my next step? Until now I just thought I would be best of just waiting and let it go and it would happen all by itself. But I’m afraid that it will not work since it didn’t the last time I had like the exact same situation. 
 Just for you to know, I’m a male, 18 years old and never had a real gf, just some experiences with girls (no sex). I think I look quite decent (dotn want to be meany) I don’t have her on facebook or her phone number. I just never heard her last name and I thought it would be a bit creepy just to ask for her last name to add her on facebook.

"I am 27M and have always been somewhat of a quick shooter. Seems like coitis would last 5 minutes and the whole idea of 20 minutes was something I wouldn't encounter. I have always made sure that my wife 28 was completely satisfied every single time. Even if I finish I always make sure she gets where she needs to go. We have been together for 10 years, married for 4. We have sex around 5 times a week. This was something I was just going to have to live with. I have been practicing breathing exercises and it seems to have been helping a bit. 
 Now this is where the story gets strange. I have very severe sleep apnea and snore very loudly. I saw a few doctors and had sleep studies done and recently got a CPAP machine. During my sleep study they found that I stopped breathing 205 times during the night. Within a couple of days our sex has dramatically improved. I am now lasting much longer without even doing breathing exercises. We are on a streak now of a week straight with 20-30 minute coitis. 
 My only thought is that my mild PE was in part caused by my sleep apnea and lack of sleep. I am feeling everything that I was feeling before, my erections are fuller and we are going at it much faster and much deeper. My wife has gone from completely satisfied to completely insane. She has even mentioned I feel at least an inch longer than I felt before. 
 I have done some searching and I find links between sleep apnea and ED but haven't found anything alluding to sleep apnea and PE. 
 I wanted to share my story with sexxit. I truly believe there is a link there at least for me and I wanted to help others. If you snore horribly, go see your doctor.","Sex was good at 5 minutes.

 A gf I had in high school was obsessed with GWAR. I was eh about them (not really my type - my Sansa was chock full of Guns 'n' Roses, Aerosmith, Metallica, and Weezer) but I saw a show was coming to town so I got her tickets. 
 We got there early, to get a spot right up front (""more blood!""). Cut to halfway through the concert, and a mosh pit develops about three people behind us.

"I live at home with my family. About a month ago or so I dove into a poor decision. I attempted to kill myself. I took roughly 700 mg of Baclofen (Lioresal or many other brand names) and started a whole huge ordeal. I am young, only 21 haven't really done much with my life but for the sake of the whole story I'll let it all out. 
 My childhood was kinda shitty, Beat by my dad and insulted by him for being kinda chunky. Kids aren't much better but hey all that was short term and wrapped up eventually at the end of middle school. 
 I was popular in high school and very active in sports, theater, and academics and had a fair portion of ""friends"" and a few really good buddies, as well as a girlfriend. my Senior year I blew out my arm in a really bad way and ruined my sports life and caused me to get a case of the ""fuck its"" ruining my academics and making my circle of social life shrink to nothing but basically my girlfriend and my best friend. Around this time another girl who was attractive began to show interest in me and i made the mistake of taking that too far and I kissed her. I reconciled with my SO it was done with and we moved on. Soon after we discovered that she was pregnant. we decide it would be best to take care of our baby ourselves. 
 She and I lived together and raised our son and we scraped by fairly well for a while, but I became more and more complacent and shut in. eventually I reached out and sent a text to the previous gal who almost ended us prior. (I know classy right?) she was devastated to say the least and we fought and I honestly for all the love I had for her I didn't fight to keep her even I truly did (and still do) love her. so we went our separate ways and it wasn't as bad as it could have been and we ended up with 50-50 custody. 
 But now here I am only me and my son who wasn't there half the week. I leeched into and dove into a relationship with that damn girl. I forced myself to believe that the remaining feelings I had for my ex were all for her and became cynical, irate, and vented all my sadness into one person who did the same to me. Both of us undeserving of this unhealthy abusive situation. eventually after over a year of that she breaks up with me which who the fuck blames her, I would have broke up with her but I was so fucked and unstable I needed someone. 
 Then almost too conveniently I came across these pills. I never truly planned to but I looked at them and a culmination of 3 years of failure to cope as a now jobless human fucking being sank in 2 year old son napping in the fucking house i began to take EVERY FUCKING ONE OF THEM before telling his mother what I did. Then I sent a text the ex and told her. She thought i was bluffing nothing more. 
 My son now picked up I get kitchen knife and sit in my closet and my family now beginning to check to see what was up as I'm calling my son's mother/my ex in a Psychotic break of apologies while telling my family to stay the fuck back that and that while telling them i was going to die. 
 That's when it got hazy. I ended up in the Icu for 3 days and had a few seizures and lucky for only that from what they told me. As well as about 5 days in a psych ward setting up out patient treatment. 
 so here i am. No friends, hospital bills, Guilt, and just all around fucked what the fuck do Now?","1st world problems lead me to taking a (near)lethal dose of Muscle relaxers. wtf now?

"Reddit, 
 Please, please, please give me some insight on this. It's driving me crazy: 
 I've been spending a lot of time recently with a ""straight,” pro-gay fraternity friend watching TV. He’s a 2nd year, but we’ve never really talked or hung out until now. I’m a 5th year, and he, as well as the entire fraternity, knows I'm gay. We've been meeting up in my dorm room (inside the fraternity) about every other day for about 3 weeks now to watch Game of Thrones, and now True Blood. It's almost always just him, but if there's a 3rd person, it doesn't happen. Let me explain- he's been putting his legs up against my feet while we're watching TV, and I'll gladly rest my feet there on his thigh or leg for the rest of the episode. Here's the setup: my room is tiny, and I sit in my desk chair with my feet propped up on my bed. He sits on my bed facing the TV, which is near me, so his legs are positioned towards me. 
 The first day of watching TV, it was extremely subtle- he would put his legs up against a single toe, then I'd slowly creep my whole foot closer and closer to the point where I was obviously resting them against his leg. On the 2nd day, this happened much faster- I put my feet near him and then he brought his legs in to meet the soles of my feet. This has been happening almost every single time since then, and when it does happen, it would be for about 80% of the time we're watching TV together (anywhere from 1-4 hours).  There's sometimes an obvious pushing force from his side, but not enough to push my feet away. Sometimes, I even snuggle my toes under his legs. If he repositions, it will usually happen in such a way that I'm touching another part of his legs, like his knees. 
 I've been pretty frustrated lately, because now I'm starting to think he might not be entirely straight, and I'm starting to like him. I finally mentioned something to him last week- I pointed to my feet resting against his thigh and asked him if I was violating his personal space (even though he's the one that usually instigates). He said no, and I said that none of my straight friends would be so comfortable with that. He shrugged and responded that I have clean feet and that it doesn’t matter. At this point, the True Blood intro sequence is over and we go back to watching TV. 
 This week, the behavior has escalated. A few days ago, he counted the toes on my right foot, touching each one individually with his finger, for just a single pass. Then yesterday, he quickly and briefly grabbed my knee during an intense moment in the show. Then today, he rested his feet on my chair in such a way that it made my whole chair and body swivel towards him. Our legs were touching, essentially snuggling side by side.  At this point, he puts his feet up against my right thigh, and I gently rest my hand on top of his foot. He didn't move, so I slowly began to sort of tickle/play with his toes. This happened for about 10-15 minutes, and he never pulled away. After that, I went to the bathroom and came back, and for a full 2 episodes, nothing happened. Nothing at all. He stayed outside of my reach. 
 Writing all this out makes it sound very obvious what's going on. But I've been talking with some [pro-gay] friends that know him better than me, and they assure me that he's straight. They say he's just a touchy-feely guy that's extremely comfortable around men (especially since he's been on a water polo team). Something else that makes me think I might be wrong: there have been a couple days where absolutely nothing happens when we’re watching TV. Also, every now and then, he’ll retract his body in such a way that I can no longer reach. 
 I really hope that my gut feeling of him being bi or gay is not wrong, but I don’t want to get my hopes up any more. This boy is one of the hottest, cutest, and most attractive people that I know, and I don’t want to fuck anything up either. Reddit, what do you think is happening, and how should I proceed?

"Here's my long rambling post. I'm sleepy but it should definitely make more sense than what some idiots are saying. 
 Seriously, why are these MIDDLE-AGED ADULTS commenting on the educational system? THEY NEVER WENT THROUGH the system as it currently is and it's been a HELL OF A LONG TIME since they even WERE in a public education system. /puts up flame shield : There are many high school students (and college), and I know I’m one of them, who are much more intelligent, knowledgeable, and cultured than these “analysts” with degrees in an UNCOMPETITIVE FIELD from THIRD-RATE PODUNK UNIVERSITIES…an education PH.D from the University of Western North Dakota doesn’t mean shit, much less make sense. LISTEN TO THE GODDAMN STUDENTS. In one year, I’ll be able to vote for the fucking president, have sex, do anything legal that normal adults can do and you won’t even let me effect changes on something I HAVE FIRST HAND, FUCKING FRESH, experience with? Allowing senile bingo-addicted senior citizens to fuck my country's future because they're selfish and won't live to see any improvements is retarded.  I know I’M smarter than a 5th grader unlike the mentally- atrophying cubicle-dwelling masses. 
 As a student at a top-200 public high school, I say F--K the stupid, lazy, in-the-box teachers who are ruining the educational system. I have had a lot of great, awesome, inspiring, intelligent, wonderful, warm teachers. If performance were considered a factor, THESE PEOPLE WOULD BE GETTING REWARDED FOR THEIR EFFORTS INSTEAD OF BEING LUMPED TOGETHER WITH insert example of terrible teacher here There are right-wing teachers denouncing Obama’s socialist policies. HOW ABOUT YOU TAKE A FUCKING LOOK AT YOUR JOB: If we applied “competition” (key factor of capitalism in case you were dumb) to your jobs, there would be two possible paths: HELP your students actually have a future and GET PAID WELL FOR IT, or get fired and become homeless for being incompetent and having your salary go to good teachers. It’s called competition, and it should apply to more things. 
 The only people who have more of an influence on children's education, no wait, A CHILD'S ENTIRE FREAKING LIFE = parents. However, nothing short of changing American culture and erasing the image of (""good at school"" = nerd/loser) can change the parents. The teachers... we can change them. 
 Also, don't spew bullshit about test-scores having nothing to do with teacher efficiency. Obviously, one should not compare the test scores of teachers at freaking Thomas Jefferson with those of teachers at an inner-city school. PUT YOUR GODDAMN COLLEGE DEGREES TO WORK AND CONSIDER SOMETHING CALLED RELATIVITY: Compare teachers AT A SINGLE SCHOOL. Pay them accordingly. Jesus Christ, is that so hard? 
 Finally: Yeah, test scores aren't everything. People can point to Albert Einstein (LOOK HE WAS BAD AT SCHOOL). I guess you forgot to read the part where his brain has AN ENTIRE FUCKING PARIETAL OPERCULUM MISSING. I don't know what that is, but he’s missing a PART OF HIS BRAIN. The general consensus is that generally, HIGH TEST SCORES MEANS THAT ONE IS GENERALLY INTELLIGENT.
""But ipiranga, you're making a lot of generalizations...DERPDERPDERP"" ...""Because I'm talking about the education of children in an ENTIRE FUCKING NATION."" 
 I'm 17, a Junior in high school. MY CAPS LOCK KEY ISN'T ON, I'M HOLDING DOWN SHIFT BECAUSE THAT'S HOW MUCH I FUCKING HATE TEACHER-SYMPATHIZERS. STOP BEING SO LAZY, education reformers. INSTEAD OF USING YOUR UNIONS TO SAVE THE ASSES OF INCOMPETENT TEACHERS, ASK FOR BETTER WAGES FOR THE BETTER TEACHERS. Michelle Rhee had it right. 
 FUCK TENURE, FUCK SITTING ON YOUR ASSES. 
 Solution: It’s not simple. Fuck tenure. Pay effective teachers more (based on relative standings at a school). If there are 4 American History Teachers, give the one with the best scores (over a period of time) more money. Fire the incompetent one if he continuously fails to improve test scores. It’s FUCKING RELATIVE. If there’s only one teacher, look at the district. IMPORTANT: TRY AND CHANGE AMERICAN CULTURE TO VALUE SMART, HARD-WORKING PEOPLE. MAKE TEACHING A VALUABLE PROFESSION. In other cultures, teachers are as highly regarded as doctors. If we clean up our educational system and fire the slackers, the same will happen here.","If you can't even fucking read a post, you're part of the cancer. Just keep using Sparknotes.

"I was in an extremely similar situation to yours in my mid twenties.

"Okay, here is the story: 
 A while back, I can't remember how long exactly maybe a week ago, I lost it. It had been at least two weeks since we had sex. I have been married for not quite thirteen years, and have 4 kids. I have a HL, and my wife has a LL. It didn't start out that way, but I digress. We had gone to bed, and I was drifting off when I heard her vibrator kick on. I am obviously aware of what is happening immediately. I ask her (rhetorically) what she was doing. She says she couldn't sleep and wanted to have an orgasm. 
 I know under normal circumstances that isn't a big deal, but let me explain the backstory for you. We have been up and down on trying to meet in the middle. We had a few months ago reached an understanding that if someone was really just not in the mood that it was perfectly fine to say no. Ok, right? Well, since Christmas we have had sex, maybe 5 times. I am a, bare minimum, once every three days person. The spoken agreement was that if I needed it, I could just tell her. Well shit hasn't been so good for a lot of different reasons. I have gotten shut down again and again, so I was getting pretty hurt about it. 
 So she waited until she thought I would be asleep to do her business. That got me. What really got me was that she knew that I was desperate, didn't invite me to join, just kept on going. So I am laying there dying inside. She gets closer and closer, and I finally have enough, and get out of bed and leave the room. She keeps going and finishes. She never speaks of it, I have been on the couch because I can't even speak or look at her most of the time. She has had seemingly no problems with this. She goes to bed, and I avoid her at all costs. The agreement was her idea, and I conceded because it was the best I felt I was going to get. 
 I wrote her a letter, but she hasn't seen it. I wish I could revise it, but it has been sent. I have severe PTSD, am a retired disabled veteran of 32 years of age. I was in the Army, and made a lot of money. Well 7 combat deployments, IED's, firefights, death, never brought me down this much because it was all so surreal really. Don't get me wrong I know I have some issues, but I try really fucking hard everyday to keep going. I don't have any friends anymore, I just can't stand to keep in contact with my old buddies, and where we moved, there isn't anything here, and we are broke. 
 I can't reconcile this. I can go anywhere and not have sex with someone. I have no support from her, she just bitches at me because now that I am disabled and can't work that if my VA rating goes from 90 up to 100 once I tell the VA about my walking problems that I won't be able to work. Then we won't have enough money, so I avoid going to the VA, because out of the fear of them having to treat me for my injuries and I will have to submit new medical data. Then we will only get my disability. She doesn't work, she used to do nursing, then work in a financial planning place. She is was doing online courses to get ... something. I know that my family only tolerates her because of me and the kids, she is typically an internet knowitall bitch. She knows this and even gets teased for it. 
 Regardless, I have gone through so many dry spells, and I get really depressed and shitty without sex. Deployments are different, she isn't there, I know it can't happen. But when she is there and it doesn't, well hell, what am I supposed to think. She will undoubtedly see this, because she snoops on everything. She is very insecure/nosy. She actually told my mother that she follows my reddit posts. Since I have nothing to hide, I never really cared. I just can't take feeling like this anymore. I fucking despise being lonely, but I can't remember what it was like to be single. I married young, and quickly. We went pretty strong, but like I said, I was in a stable(paying) job. We lived all over the world, and had good times and bad times. My family said that whatever I need, they are there, but what about my kids. I am tearing up even thinking about it. I can't be without my kids. 
 So, I am open to any non troll advice, anything at all. I know that if she won't talk to me, then I breach the subject, but I can't. I am going to the VA rep to set up counseling/therapy next week. I have pretty much given up. I don't want to talk to her, I just want to remain indignant, and not be around her. Yes I have read what I wrote, and yes I see it too. So spit your hard truths at me, if bombs and guns haven't killed me, your words won't either.

"I HIT MY GOAL! :)
This is my first post so be easy on me.
Progress Album (Before and After) - 
 A little background: 
My entire life I've been that really tall, lanky, skeleton looking dude. I have also been pretty athletic, preferring cardio and endurance sports. In high school my max weight was 125lbs. I never starved myself or had any eating disorders, my dad even took me to a doctor who gave me a clean bill of health. I have always been able to eat what I want, when I want and NEVER gain anything. In fact in high school I remember watching that movie ""Super Size Me"" and seeing that guy eat fast food for a month and gain some serious weight...I tried it. Gained nothing and only felt sick and sluggish.
Fast forward to after high school. I started working out(no workout plan, I'd lift basic dumbbells and do cardio) and put on my first 5 lbs, but between full-time work and college I stopped working out. After stopping I noticed I retained that 5 lbs, so I would workout once a year and gain another 5 lbs. That got me to 140lbs.
I am now 22 years old. 
 Recently I got fed up with being skinny and forced myself to do some research to fix it. I bought me some protein and started to ACTUALLY work out. I set a high goal of being 160 by June 13th. From my start date of March 13th that would give me 3 Months(13 weeks) to achieve my goal. 
 Workout Routine : 
Basic meaning the normal workouts I see everyone doing(Bench, Squat, Calf raises, Bicep curls, etc)
Monday - Basic Upper Body. Max weight.
Tuesday - Basic Lower Body. Max weight.
Wednesday - Core and Back. Heavy weight but high reps.
Thursday - I hit upper body HARD doing drop sets until I burned out.
Friday - Misc day. I would hit everything that felt rested.
Saturday - Rest/Sports
Sunday - Rest 
 Diet :
Admittedly this is my week point, something I have JUST started working on as hard as my workouts. Thank you /r fitness
For the first 2 months I only added 1-2 protein shakes a day(usually 1) and a lot of fast food(living situation prevented cooking) attempting to choose ""healthier"" fast food when I could(ie: Subway).
This seemed to work VERY well as I was gaining, on average, 2lbs a week. However at 155lbs I hit a plateau. I went a couple weeks without gaining anything! 
Then I moved out and got access to a kitchen! 
During the last month I added 2 protein shakes a day and started cooking basic protein meals with rice and vegetables. Essentially pan-grilled chicken or fish, rice(mostly flavored rice), and a mix of frozen veggies. I also forced myself to eat 3-4 meals a day.\
An average day looked like this : 
Breakfast - 2 Waffles with peanut butter.
Daily protein shake
Lunch - a medium portion of a protein meal listed above.
2nd Lunch - a medium portion of a protein meal.
Post workout protein shake
Dinner - a BIG portion of a protein meal. 
 Well on June 15th(2 days after the intended date, I know) I weighed in at 161 lbs!
This has been a huge moment in my life because weight gain has been SUCH A GOD DAMN STRUGGLE for me. I am very proud of my progress and I really wanted to share it with you guys! 
 Currently I still weigh 160 lbs, my strength is increasing but my weight has plateaued again. I am going to start cracking down on my diet to see if I cant get it increasing again. I WELCOME any advice you guys can give me for weight gain. 
 Please tell me what you think and feel free to ask any questions! :)","Progress Album (Before and After) - 
 EDIT : As requested here is some extra info - The protein powder I use is ""Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard"". I DO NOT recommend the cake batter flavor...I don't know what I was thinking but it is sickeningly sweet. Stick to chocolate or strawberry or something normal.
As for my main workouts and the strength increases associated with them: 
 Exercise - Starting Weight - Current Weight (I usually do 3-6 sets depending on how fatigued the muscle is) 
 Bench Press - 45 lbs(bar) 5 reps - 135 lbs max 3 reps 
 Chest Fly(Machine) - 40 lbs 10 reps - 90 lbs 10 reps 
 Bicep Curl(Cable) - 40 lbs 10 reps - 110 lbs 10 reps 
 Bicep Curl(Dumbbell) - 15 lbs 10 reps - 30 lbs 10 reps 
 Tricep Pull Down Palm Down(Cable) - 30 lbs 10 reps - 135 lbs 4 reps 
 Tricep Pull Down Palm Up(Cable) - 20 lbs 10 reps - 90 lbs 10 reps 
 Lateral Pull Down(Cable) - 55 lbs 10 reps - 135 lbs 10 reps 
 Rows (Smith Machine) - 20 lbs + Bar 10 reps - 90 lbs + bar 10 reps 
 Side Lateral Raises(Dumbbell) - 10 lbs 10 reps - 25 lbs 10 reps 
 Leaning Forward Rows(Dumbbell) - 10 lbs 10 reps - 35 lbs 10 reps 
 Squat - 115 lbs 5 reps - 225 lbs 6 reps, too scared to max without a spotter on this. 
 Leg Extension - 180 lbs 10 reps - 275 lbs 10 reps (I stopped increasing on this because the machine kills my shins) 
 Seated Calf Raises - 45 lbs 10 reps - 160 lbs 8 reps (I also do bowlegged calf raises at 45 lbs for 2 sets of 20 reps) 
 I also use the cable machine(forgot its name) for chest, doing push downs and raises for hitting all areas of my chest. Started at 1 plate(i think they are 4lbs each) and am currently at 6 plates.
I hope this helps you guys! :) My routine really is all over the place as I try to hit EVERYTHING that is NOT sore.

"Wow so I typed all this out and then reddit was like herp derp let's delete it instead. 
 So when I was 7, my family relocated from Florida to Texas.  I was young so obviously I was getting underfoot a lot when my parents were trying to unpack and get shit situated.  They sent me to my room to play with my barbies so I wouldn't get in the way.  So it's cool, I'm playing with my barbies minding my own business when all of a sudden I get this strange feeling like I'm being watched.  I'm sitting near the bed and the doors to my bedroom are on the opposite corner.  My room is situated kind of like [this (pro paint skills, I know).](  I look up and between me and the doors, I see this little girl, I'd estimate was probably around 7-9 years old, in full pioneer attire.  She looks pissed, sad, and confused at the same time.  I scream my head off bloody murder and my parents come running as she disappears.  As I recount my story to my parents, they tell me it's all nonsense and due to my ""overactive imagination."" 
 This goes on for four years.  My parents say it's nothing, it's not real, and hang a painting of Jesus over my bed like that's supposed to help or make me feel better.  Even as a kid I didn't believe in God so that also didn't help my perspective.  I only saw her a handful of times but more often than not when I was sleeping, or even worse, when I was showering (since the bathroom was just off my bedroom) I would feel this creepy sensation of someone watching me. 
 We moved back to Florida when I was about 11, and for years I KNEW what the truth was but my parents vehemently denied it.  Finally I was about 17 or 18 in the car with my mom and mentioned it, saying I knew the rest of the family thought I was full of shit but I know for a fact she was there.  My mom went real silent for a minute and then told me that she never came clean with me as a child since she knew that it wouldn't help me deal with it any better, and she didn't have any way of explaining it, but she had seen her too and knew she was real.  One particularly momentous occasion, she walked in my room to check on me at night and I was already asleep.  Between me and her was this little girl, and my mom gasped.  The ghost turned around and looked at my mom and my mom said ""Go away!""  The little girl pouted and said ""NO!  YOU go away!"" and then vanished. 
 My brother and I also were homeschooled for a few years and I did my work in the kitchen.  My brother, being older, did his work in his bedroom.  He told me years later that he would hear soft sobbing of a small child coming from my room, when he knew I wasn't in there.  If he opened the door to go in my room, the sound would stop. 
 The sad thing is I wish I was making this up or hallucinating this.  To this day about once or twice a year I have violent nightmares about returning to this house and having her exact her revenge on me or something.  One of my greatest fears in life is returning to that house.  Good thing it's half the country away.","Kids shit bricks sometimes when in contact with ghosts, too.",18,F,AskReddit
"About two months ago I drove from Flagstaff to Phoenix, with my friends D and N, to go to a rave (Rainbow Brite 2) We have plenty of money (for broke ass people), a new sack of dank buds, an old sack of perfectly cured  dank buds (PERFECT!!!) and the next forty-eight hours to party like we mean it. We cruse down the road blasting tunes and rocking out. We smoke bowls (should we pack #1 or #2 dude?) and eat snacks. We bought a bunch of string cheese, snack bars, juice and other awesome munchies. 
 We get to the party and during the securing of the car and stashing our valuables I can't find my wallet. I figure I won't stress it because I still have all my money and I can find my wallet latter. When we get to the security guy we won't let us in because I don't have I.D. to prove I am not 16 (I am 21 and most people think I am quite a it older) and my friend D does not have any I.D. either so we can't get in. We dejectedly walk back to the car feeling really let down. 
 We get back to the car and drive off into the city and start calling everyone we know in Phoenix because we still want to party and have allot of money and weeds. We are smoking and driving and I decide to pull off the road so I won't be driving all erratic while I look up numbers. As we are sitting of the side of the road I see a big white pedo-van pull out of the ally behind us and as it turns I see the rack of  sirens. They are obviously going to come investigate us so I decide if I drive away (in a reasonable manner) I have a slightly better chance of them not investigating us. 
 I have a warm pipe with a half smoked bowl sitting in my lap so I put it in my pocket because I know I can't hide it anywhere in my car this quick. After following us for a few blocks they flip on their sirens right before I pull out onto a major street (why do they always pull you over in really shitty spots) and two cops hop out. A female cop comes up to my window and asks for my papers. I tell her I don't have my license but I give her my registration and insurance though. A male cop walks up to the passenger window and says ""I smell weed in the car"" and pulls N out of the front seat and sits him on the curb and pulls D out of the back seat (my cars a two door) as I am giving the female cop my info he says ""Get her out of the car it smells like weed"" referring to me. I am a man but I have long hair and he only saw me from behind, it happens sometimes. Despite the fact that I was going to jail I thought that was kind of funny. The female cop then pulls me out of the car and handcuffs me, pats me down, she feels the pipe and ask if she can get stuff out of my pockets I tell her no (can't search me without a warrant bitches) so she sits me on the curb and goes and has a brief conversation with her partner than climbs into their van starts running all our info (remember two of us have no ID on us). The guy cop is grilling my friends and one of them ( I think D) tells the cop that yes we were smoking in the car. As he digs through the car he finds my sneak-a-toke and another one hitter in my friends bag. He now has two counts of paraphernalia against us. He keeps re asking us who we are and why we are there (trying to catch us lying)
I will answer some of his questions be I don't say anything self incriminating. I admit nothing but my friends are not so strong willed. 
 After looking through my car as thoroughly as he can with out breaking protocol. ""So why are you guys in Phoenix?"" ""To go to a rave, we couldn't get in."" ""So you guys have a bunch of ecstasy in the car. Thats what people do at raves right?"" ""Fuck that shit, some people go for the dancing and music."" ""Right..."" He comes up to me and asks pointblank what we were smoking out of, I know he knows I have a pipe in my pocket so i decide that I might as well give it to him, I really don't like the idea of giving a cop a pipe with weed in it but He knows it is there and already has plenty to arrest me for so I give it to him. A little while latter he comes back over (it felt like forever but it was probably like thirty seconds) and asks was that all the weed you guys have? I don't answer. He goes back to th car and pocks around a bit more then comes back over. ""Look I'm going to be strait with you, If you give us the rest of your marijuana we will destroy it and let you guys leave with nothing but a ticket for driving without a license. I am serously conflicted, he is either a decent person who realizes we are just dumb kids and he has better shit to deal with or he is an evil pig and wants me to self incriminate so they can better press charges latter. I figure that at this point I am already in trouble for pipes and the weed in the pipe so I go for it. I still don't know how I decided other than to say it felt like he was legit. I tell him where my nugs are stashed in the car and he goes and grabs them and drops them in his bag of pipes. The female cop then exits the van and walks me over to my car and tells me  she is going to remove my handcuffs. I sign the ticket for driving with out ID on you (A jail-able criminal offense in AZ just as a heads up) and lets us drive off into the night, after telling us it would be a good idea if we left phoenix. 
 We drive back up to flagstaff, arrive around 2 a.m. (when they stop selling alcohol round here), on a hunch I decide to call this random Japanese guy who gave me his number and we get invited to a party and a friend of a friend's house. We get there and tell them of our adventures. One kid drives back to his house to get his weed and brings i back just so we could smoke it because the cops took all ours, he didn't even smoke with us. So we ended up getting drunk and high with a bunch of Asians and had a great end to an otherwise not so great day. I really, really hope those cops hot-boxed their van with my weed because both sacks were really good, but the older on was perfect. I would hate for those choice trees to be waisted. Those Asian kids were all super nice, really awesome people. 
 I also got the charges for the license dropped since it was clear that I had lost my wallet hundreds of miles from home.","Almost got arrested, pipes and weed confiscated, got high and drunk with Asians.

"I'm taking a small break from College Chronicles to give you my most recent hamplanet excursion. Feel free to skip the background and head straight to the story if you'd like. 
 
 Background 
 Let me rest your jimmies by telling you that I am now 26, graduated from college in 2010, therefore I'm very much alive and was not, in fact, flayed like so many of you are worried about. 
 After college, I got a job in advertising, so a lot of my job is sitting all day. Some days it's 6 hours, some days it's 12 hours. But it's lots of microsoft office and indesign. I quickly gained weight and went from about 110 in college to 145 in 2012. Not planetary status, but 35 pounds was enough to make my 5'4"" frame cry. 
 Last year Mrwonderful and I decided to do something about it (yes we are married now)! He kicked it into gear and went from 210 - 185 with P90X. I unfortunately was off and on making excuses. I dropped about 11 pounds. 
 This year I kicked it into high gear. Since January 1 I've gone from 134 - 124. Booya. I also just received a promotion so we decided to celebrate last night. This is where our story begins. 
 
 Story 
 >Be Polar. Celebrating promotion and 10 pound droppage with buddies. 
 >Don't Be RiledRhino. Hammy of planetary proportions. 
 We arrive at a bar we frequent many weekends and thirsty thursdays. So much so the bouncer knows us and always just waves us in. It's a divey place, we did enough of the downtown-10-dollars-for-college-beer crap in high school and college. Tonight we were celebrating, I just got a promotion this week. Bonus celebration, I hit the 10 pounds lost mark. Drinks on me! 
 I learned a valuable lesson about the relationship between losing pounds and losing my tolerance level. One beer and two measly vodka tonics in and I was a goner. I'm very much a happy, hyper, love everything type of drunk and it's pretty obvious I'm blasted. That's when I notice RiledRhino laughing and pointing at me from the other side of the bar. 
 I scurry over. 
 >Polar: Hey! What are we laughing about? I'm Polar by the way. 
 >RiledRhino: Yeah no thanks. And you. I'm laughing at you. Didn't I make that obvious enough? 
 >Polar: Hey I'm just having a good time with some friends. Nothin' wrong with that. You guys should join us! 
 >RiledRhino: There is when your skanky ass is wack dancing all over the place. Ugh, thin girls piss me off something fierce. 
 >Polar: What exactly did I do to you? 
 >RiledRhino: Girl this is my bar, you walking in here is what you did. Take your lightweight ass home bitch. 
 I've never seen this girl here. I call her out. 
 >Polar: Hey Bouncer! Have you seen this chick here before? She says it's her bar. 
 >Bouncer: Nope. First time in my life. 
 >Polar: So what about this being your bar? 
 >RiledRhino: Please. Like he's going to side with me, he's a fatshaming douchebag anyway.  Now go away lightweight loser. 
 >Polar: Are.. you.. are you like jealous of me being a lightweight or something? 
 >RiledRhino: Actually I'm offended by it. It's so typical for thin girls. But no, I'm the unhealthy one. Right? 
 >Polar: I don't know. Are you? Why is it so damn offensive? 
 >RiledRhino: This is the perfect example of society's standards and how fucked they are. Look how sad and pathetic your organs are. They can't even keep up with your little tiny girly drinks. That's healthy? 
 >Polar: Umm... 
 >RiledRhino: No seriously. Nevermind that I can handle my booze. I've been throwing these back like water and I'm not half as retarded as you. My fat makes my organs stronger because they work harder. It gives me more muscle and alcohol tolerance. But let's all praise the skinny white trash for meeting the world's expectations. PATHETIC. 
 >Polar: Muscle? All I see is fat. 
 There's that whole drunk alpha-ing up thing that seems to get me in trouble. 
 >RiledRhino: It's under a protective layer of skin dumbass. 
 >Polar: I really think you're calling the wrong person dumbass. 
 >RiledRhino: EXCUSE ME BROKE BITCH?

"Okay /r/dating_advice, 
 I am 20, she is 24. There is this girl that I got to know better through a class we both took. She and I went to this small kick-back sort of thing and I brought my roommate who served as kind of a wingman. I talked to mostly her for the whole night, and my friend gave me some advice before and during (you could say I'm a newbie regarding female interaction) this event. I thought I was making good progress, being friendly and doing incidental physical contact. Then my friend took her aside and basically told her that I really like her and that she was the first girl I really had the courage to approach. 
 Her response to this was to say that the whole situation was really 'sweet of me', she said I looked cute but also said she was unsure of what she wanted and could not look upon me as more than a friend. She also mentioned she had just ended a long relationship (2+ years) and she would have to wait and see in regards to me.","this girl I really like just recently ended a long relationship, she is attracted to me (or am I perceiving this whole thing wrong?) but is unsure what to do in the moment.

"I bought a 2003 Tiburon GT 6 months ago, and I can tell my joy for it will fade soon. I bought it for its styling more than its performance. I did all I can do for performance without taking apart the engine (ColdAir/Exhaust/Headers) and it was recently repainted black again. I've done some interior mods too, as well as a new audio system. 
 Anywho, I am thinking about selling it for another car that would be better performance-wise. I'm almost 18 at the moment, so it would be a car that is a daily driver, and it needs to be front or AWD, as I live in Minnesota and winter is coming. Basically, I want ideas for a sporty car that is in the $5,000-$6,500 range. I expect to be able to sell my car for at least $5,500 in the condition it is in, and I'm not in a rush so I can wait for a decent offer. 
 It can be a car that takes some work to get a decent power output, but I prefer to steer away from older Hondas (Want to stay out of the ricer stereotype that is rampant where I live, so no CRXs, older Civics, etc.), as they're not really my cup of tea.

"Indian guy (from India) in a relationship with an Indian Girl (who grew up here, i.e.ABCD for the last 7 months. I met her on OKC and the odds of meeting an Indian for LT was pretty low there and I was reasonably happy with that in the beginning. Off late I am beginning to observe that she is getting too clingy for me and sort of like smothering me with attention (not that its bad, but the interest level has reached like 80(her)-20(me) from 50(her)-50(me). 
 We have discussed everything about each other and the families and it was smooth sailing till a couple of days back when she's started acting like OAG. We have also discussed about our past like who we have been with etc. after seeing **[this]( post I started rethinking on my existing relationship. She says that she's not been with any guy and its not that it would bother me if she had, its just that I don't want to end up like the above post once I take the plunge. 
 Couple of things I am not sure about, I have known her only for the last 7 months and I know nothing about her time before, she's had a gap of nearly 4 years in her career which she still does not clarify adequately. While I understand that it is agreeable to wait for the right person to have a family with, it is quite rare for Indian girls to stay unmarried till their late 30s. The way the relationship has progressed its more like she's completely head over heels for me while I am still cautious about things(thats how I have been since I was a kid). 
 The thing at this stage is that I wouldn't mind settling down with her provided everything is explained upfront. My concern right now is if she's genuinely interested in me, the person, or is it that she's latched onto the only Indian she came across (which would be easier for her parents to agree too over a comparable caucasian/asian guy) and factoring that she's hitting 30, her biological clock ticking could also be one of the reasons for her to be this involved. She's like if this does not work out ( which she insists everyday that she doesn't want to end ), let me know by the end of October so that I can look elsewhere. Also her OKC account is still active even though we have been going out for 7 months.",Indian guy(29M) in a relationship with Indian girl(29M) who he met online and GF is acting like OAG and guy not sure if girl is genuinely interested or rushing into settling,29,M,relationships

"Hate to burst the bubble but I ran a glass shop that's still going, been there since the 60's in NY and we regularly purchased Indian/China hand pipes. (yuk I know, forgive me ) Unfortunately I did not have the power to make the final call on all store purchases and we had pieces from 15k to under a dollar and this was back in 2000. The owners reasoning is, ""why not have people buy them from us vs the gas stations (when that is what they are going to buy anyway) and maybe we can convince em to buy better"". 
 But I digress, the gentlemen whom we bought them from were both Indian, and had been selling them to the shop for longer than I had been alive at the time (I'm now in my mid 30's). He had told us many times in his stoned rambling (we would smoke in the boss's office) about how they (both his family and the majority of those in his town) had been blowing glass since the 30's and they made cheap touristy trinkets but changed em over to pipes in the late 60's and early 70's (due to the massive influx of hippies and Beatles fans some one prob taught em then too) and he would bring them over by the case and travel around and sell them at concerts and to gas stations and head shops. Back then you had to ask for an ""under the counter deal"" or know the owners of the store vs now they are in their own cases at every single one...","more than one dealer told us almost the exact same story of them being made since the 60's-70's, does not explain the current influx though, maybe it's to scale with the current explosion?",35,M,glassheads
"I was tripping more than I thought could be possible with weed, I can only imagine that I was at least at an [8] whereas before I had only been able to hit a good [4] or [5]. So, in detail, this is the story of how I got there and what it felt like, enjoy my leap to adulthood! 
 Background:
Yesterday I asked my friend to stay the night at my place and we could hang out. This friend we can call ""Z"". Z is the friend I always smoke with, he is the one who provides the bud, in fact, he's the one who introduced me to it a couple months ago. To his best ability he had tried to explain the effects of marijuana to me but every time we smoked, I never felt what he was talking about. I would usually get to a, still completely functional human being, kind of high, just a little more than a buzz even after an entire bowl. For a while though we only smoke Sativa. But last night that streak ended. 
 Yesterday:
Z shows up at around 9:00 and sets his bag down on the bar. Instantly he begins pulling out his bong, grinder, pill bottles, and a few other things. I didn't even expect to get high that night but since he insisted, I started preparing the bong with some ice and water while he pulls out a sweet nug and tells me that it's straight Indica, (Which I knew I had never smoked before).I was pretty excited. Grinded, packed, and prepared we took the bong to the back porch and sat down on a couch. 
 ~9:45 Straight into it. I took the first hit, cornering the bowl (thanks to the 420 code), and coughed that shit out like a pussy. It had been a few weeks since I last smoked, plus I'm no veteran so yeah I have my excuses. I felt it though, I knew it was a good hit [2]. I passed it to Z and he took his, bigger than mine of course, but he didn't clear it. It sat for a few seconds when I noticed it wasn't cleared so I took the opportunity, coughed even worse after that. Z took another hit whilst I grabbed a couple waters and sat back down. After that I only took one more hit and cleared one of his and that's all we smoked. Later we would realize that it was merely the top of the bowl, but shit that's all it took to blast me. 
 Stage 1. Within seconds of my last hit everything went weird. [6] I remember feeling like everything was moving at about 5 fps (for all you struggling PC gamers who know the feel). Z started the deep conversation and as much as I wanted to listen and partake, I was freaking out. I had never felt this before. My heart was racing, everything felt slow, and paranoia hit and I began telling Z, ""Let's go inside, I'm having a bad trip."" Z being the bro he is, calmed me down and informed me that I'm okay, I'm only on drugs, which now seems a bit counter-intuitive but it helped then. I began to think of how long this was going to last and how stupid I was to get this high. We eventually moved inside and sat on the couch watching TV. 
 ~10:05 Stage 2. [8-9] I feel like I'm out of my body, floating somewhere, then I would come back and realize where I am. I kept forgetting where I was and what the hell was going on about every minute. But I would look at Z and be reminded of everything. I remember explaining to him what was going on somewhat like this, ""It's like all that I see and know is our conversation, like you and me here right now connected. Then I look around and it's like I remember life, and I keep doing this every 5 minutes. Like holy shit there's a whole life out there and I just learned about it...again!"" It was really cool to that this was happening. I was amazed at something that I literally live everyday. By this time I had remembered some advice I read on /r/trees saying not to worry, and just sit back relax, and enjoy it which is exactly what I began to do at this point. I was loving it. Although I realized my stupidity in how I was speaking and I apologized to Z saying sorry I'm not being deep right now and I'm talking really dumb. for example I kept thinking it had been DAYS when it had only been a few minutes. To which he replied, ""Bro don't worry, I know for a fact that you're actually really smart."" This got me more excited, I couldn't wait to get back to when I was going to be smart again. I was ripped. I got so excited that I was this high that I told Z we needed to watch some Lucas Bros. Moving Company since it's practically made to be watched while high. I ran upstairs to grab my laptop. 
 ~10:30 Music. Glorious fucking music. At the top of the stairs I noticed my keyboard(Digital Piano). Instantly distracted I began playing. At first the keys seemed to be moving and I wasn't able to keep up, but I just trusted my instincts and began playing Fur Elise. Oh my God I was lost in the notes. I could see and feel the music. That feeling was seriously the most awe inspiring feeling that I had ever felt. I played multiple songs for fifteen minutes straight, which to me then felt like forever, when I noticed Z behind me laughing his ass at how high I was and recording me with his phone. He loves messing around on my keyboard sober so I asked him if he's ever played high. He took over and began to play. It wasn't any real songs but to us it was the voices of angels singing in our ears. I lied down on the floor and enjoyed it thinking, this is the best time of my life. Contempt with everything I wished I could had stayed there forever. Although, our piano play came to an end sadly. But we moved into the upstairs game room where I have a large Bose sound system I just couldn't resist. I plugged up my phone, opened Spotify, and cranked it up. I believe the song we played was Holiest by Glass Animals. It felt like I was at the concert. I was completely lost in the music and enjoying it when suddenly my logic kicked in. It's 11:00 and the neighbors have kids. If they call on a noise complaint, It probably wouldn't end well. So I stopped the music and finally grabbed my laptop. 
 ~11:something We were back downstairs. I set up my laptop to the TV and afterward rewarded myself because I was amazed that I could do such a thing.(I'm pretty tech savvy and know more about computers and stuff than the average computer user so I don't know why I was so surprised by me plugging an HDMI cable into my laptop and being able to see it on the TV screen). By now I was still tripping but not nearly as bad as before. I'd say I had dropped to a [6-7]. We enjoyed the rest of the night watching some Lucas Bros and eating chips and snickers then crashed upstairs on the couches. 
 In the morning I got up at 6:30, shaved, showered, and even cooked some sausage that we both ate before we left for school. I gotta say I expected more of a hangover but I was surprisingly productive. Anyways, that's the story of how I experienced my first real trip. It was fantastic, and wouldn't have been that great if it weren't for Z to be there with me the whole time. Thank you for reading if you did, please tell me if you enjoyed it or if you have any similar or bizarre experiences when reaching a new high.","TH;DR: Me and a friend smoked half a bowl and it turned into the greatest night of my life. I had the memory of a goldfish and found that playing the piano at an [8] is the greatest thing ever.

"Warning: wall of text ahead, I'm so sorry. 
 I've been reading through these threads and linked websites for days, absolutely enthralled.  Suddenly an awful lot of things make sense---all these weird things that happen, happen to other people too!  I've had chronic pain since I can remember, and have always been super-flexible.  My go-to party trick used to be doing the middle splits, then leaning forward, holding my toes on each side and laying my torso flat on the floor. I'm 42 now and I can't do that anymore, but I can still do the splits and easily palm the floor with my knees straight. I dislocated my left sacroiliac joint when I was 22, and during PT they kept 'accidentally' dislocating my knees and ankles while trying to reduce the SI. 
 Things have only gotten worse since.  I can sublux almost every joint I have, including both hips and all of my fingers.  I can visibly dislocate my wrists and elbows, which is always a fun way of grossing people out. :)  My knees and ankles sound like rice krispies when I stand up, walk, etc; my shoulders and neck pop/crack whenever I move them.  I have costochondritis all the time, and have done since I was a teen. 
 With my second child I had a uterine prolapse, along with cystocele and rectocele; and have had chronic pelvic problems since then.  Also have mitral valve prolapse, reflux, I'm nearsighted, I'm tall and thin (well, not as thin as when I was younger!).  Add in chronic fatigue and pelvic neuropathy and things get really fun! 
 I've been diagnosed with fibro by a rheumy, and had psoriatic arthritis (mostly) ruled out by the same doc.  I've been evaluated for MS, PsA, lupus, RA, hypothyroid...you name it, they've checked for it.  But no one's ever taken my joint problems seriously.  And as time goes on, they seem to get looser and more painful. 
 I'm curious though, there's one thing that happens all the time that I haven't seen mentioned on here.  Often when I walk, somewhere between picking my foot up and placing it down again, my ankle sort of ""drops"".  So when I set my foot down, I'm actually 'crunching' the ankle back in place.  Does that make sense?  Same thing happens with my knees, and also with my hips.  I've actually subluxed my hips and/or SI joints just standing still.  Does this happen to you guys? Or with hands/elbows when you pick something up?  Or just feeling like nothing is 'lined up' correctly?  Like your hip's off-kilter, so your knee is off and also your ankle/foot? 
 One last question--does anyone have a checklist (or similar) to take to an appointment?  I've found the Pocinki paper and it's like reading my own bio.  But do you have a simpler checklist you've used successfully with a doc?","I'm still freaking weird, but I'm not the only one!  I seriously feel like I've found my people! :)",42,F,ehlersdanlos
"6 yo, or 1st grade. Hanging out with some friends at after school daycare including this one suave guy (for a 6 yo) and his ""girlfriend"". He was telling stories on how he has kissed 10 girls, and she gets a little jealous. She says to me, ""let's go outside to the playground."" Thinking, ""ok. I want to play tag (or something),"" I agree and as soon as we round the corner she stops me. She then kissed me which felt awesome. Right after, she goes back to the group: ""I kissed hdj.""

"Two years ago, I was hanging out with a friend at uni, waiting with him for his dad to pick him up. His dad and brother roll up to us, and ask us if we wanted to go to the casino with them (Mind you, I was 18, as was his brother, and he was 20). We decided to go, because fuck it, what else is there to do? 
 We drive about an hour or so, smoke a couple of joints on the way, and all is going well. We got the casino and started walking around. I figured we were just going to hang out and sight see since we were not of age to gamble. 
 Well, this was not the case. While I had no money on me, my friend did, and he got some chips to play with. He gave me a $25 chip, and we proceed to sit at a $10 blackjack table, high as shit. Now, mind you, I was pretty scared that someone was going to ask us for I.D. as soon as we entered the gambling area. However, we got through and sat down with no problem. 
 After a few hours, I had turned my $25 chip into a pocketful of chips, about $275. We left that table, and went to the higher stakes tables, with $50 betting minimums. I broke even, my friend and his brother were up to about $500 at this point. We go to another table, and boy was that a good choice. We ended up sitting with several other folks, one of whom apparently really knew what he was doing, as he was telling everyone when to hit and when to bust, since it would benefit us all. I'd say about 85% of the time he was correct. This dude helped me more than double my money. 
 At this point, it was about 5 a.m. We decided to collect our money and cash out. I was worried they would ask us for I.D. here, but again, nothing. We cashed out our chips, totaling a little over $2000, and left. 
 Needless to say, I was psyched, I had $650 in my pocket after going with absolutely nothing, and we had a blast. My friend had left with $1100, and his brother had $440. Feels good, man.","Went to the casino with my friend and his brother, all of us underage, and gambled all night. I left with $650, friend with $1100, friend's brother with $440.",18,M,AskReddit
"I would like some legal advice on what to do/tell the university judicial board in my situation. Two weeks ago my buddy's dorm room was searched after he and a number of other people (stupidly) smoked out the dorm and the RA's smelled the dank stank from all the way down the hall and called the cops. There was a large amount of alcohol in the room and some other sketchy things i wont go into. I was not present when the raid occurred but my backpack taken up in the search and there was a small amount of marijuana in it. Also on my backpack was a tag with my name, address, phone number, everything, and my car/room/house keys were in the side pocket. my friend claimed responsibility for everything in the room, including the bud in my backpack, so i thought i was ok despite losing my backpack and keys. However yesterday i received and email from the judicial board and now i have an appointment to discuss the charges tomorrow. Since it was not actually found on me, do i have a good chance of getting off scott free if i claim i forgot the backpack in the room earlier in the day before the drinking/smoking started and that someone must have slipped the bud in the backpack when the cops showed up?

"No Regrets] 
 I am a 21 year old woman, and my sister is 16. We both live at home with our parents, in a stable, devout Catholic household. We were never close, even in childhood, we each preferred the company of our brother (who is 19 and off at college) to each other. We're also completely different in every way- opposite personalities, opposite social abilities, opposite body types. For as long as I can remember we've never liked each other. I always resented her for needing so much attention, for being a brat despite never having been spoiled, for getting away with rudeness to our parents, and her constant destruction of the few things I owned. As far as I could tell, she resented me for being autistic, better behaved, and a poor example of an elder sister, who spent all my time reading alone instead of playing with her. 
 Then it all changed when I was 14, and she was 9. That is when I started displaying signs of chronic depression, and was uncharacteristically angry and violent (and possibly suicidal). I would hit both my younger siblings- I never saw this as a problem, because both of them have always been stronger, heavier, and tougher than I ever was, and so I couldn't really inflict any lasting damage on them. Luckily, I've been on anti-depressants that remove most emotions ever since, which has eradicated any anger, although done nothing about the actual depression. 
 Fast forward to about 2 years ago, when my sister also started to display signs of depression. Unlike me, who focused all my hatred towards myself, she focused all her hatred outward. Specifically at me. She rejected God, shaved half her head, insisted she was a lesbian and I was a hateful bigot for sticking with Catholic doctrine, adopted socialist political views, and dropped out of school for a year (she couldn't ""handle it""), all of which really upset our Mom. 
 And then 11 months ago, out of the blue, when we were home alone together (I was to ""keep an eye on her""), she walks into my room and starts discussing abortion and gay ""marriage"". I am calmly rebutting all of her arguments, getting frustrated at her lack of understanding despite years of classes on Catholic teachings, and she gets angrier at my ""bigotry"". This leads to shouting, swearing, and eventually, she punches me in the face repeatedly, grabs me by my hair, throws me on the floor, and continues punching my face, insisting that I ""killed her friend"", who she had never mentioned ever before, who apparently had down syndrome, was raped by her cousin, and died because she couldn't get an abortion, and that it's all because of me, who voted Republican, and that I should be dead instead of her (the friend). Ignoring my incredible skepticism at this conveniently tragic story, about a friend who my mom didn't know about (she knows about everybody's friends), I started insisting that I don't know this person, and it's really sad that she died, but there's nothing that can be done about it, so why are you punching me?  She eventually stopped, and I asked her to leave my room. She said no, so I demanded it. She still wouldn't. More shouting happened, and she started going on about how I was ""the perfect child"" to our parents and a ""terrible role model"" and her depression and hatred is all my fault, and since rebutting this is going nowhere, I at last get her to leave by picking up my flip phone and tell her that if she didn't leave my room, I'd call Mom, who was coming home from work at that point, and wouldn't she be so disappointed that one of her daughters beat up the other? this worked, and it was quiet. I cried for the first time in years, and I felt lucky I wasn't wearing my glasses, or I could have ended up with a huge gash in my head (like what happened to my brother when he ran into a wall by accident and his glasses cut into his forehead). Then the screaming started. It turns out my sister had, in the 5 minutes since the confrontation, swallowed a whole load of medications, and wouldn't let me help her, screaming while I was on the phone with 911 that I should let her die. One trip to the hospital and a week at a psych ward later, she was back, and fine. 
 It's been nearly a year, and she's still hostile and angry. Last time I asked why she blames everything on me, she declared that I abused her (I do not remember this), and then went upstairs, as it turns out, to rip the head and limbs off the teddy bear I'd had for 12 years. We mostly try to avoid each other, but living in the same house, with mandated family dinners together every night, and now without our brother in the house as a buffer, that does not always work. I've discovered that alongside my fear of her (which my mom says is unreasonable), I have a difficult to place emotion, which I strongly suspect might be hatred for her. This terrifies me, as according to my religious beliefs, hatred is really really dangerous to one's soul. I have no idea what to do, but I feel I needed to get the whole story out to someone, as I have nobody to tell it to.","My younger sister and I have been at odds since childhood, we both suffer from clinical depression, she hates my guts for reasons unknown, beat me up in my own room and tried to kill herself within an hour period, and now I think I hate her and that scares me.",21,F,confession
"Hello Reddit. 
 I made a similar post in /r/askgaybros but everyone just generally told me to stop being a slut and use condoms. 
 I figured I would try here and see if I could get better clarity / direction on what I should do. My confession is simple. I'm 22 and I've had sex with 193 guys, and more often than not, condoms wouldn't be used. 
 I genuinely don't want to be in this situation. Let me start from the beginning. 
 I used to be on gay chatrooms and whatnot as a kid (remember Mogenic? lol). Anyway, I ended up meeting a guy when I was 15. He was 20 or so. We just chilled and one thing led to another and we did it. Goodbye virginity! I don't regret it but I might have acted differently in hindsight. 
 So first in addressing the sex element. I would sneak out and have sex with guys, until I was 18 and would be able to leave home without any issues (I couldn't before because I was doing my Year 12 / HSC study / still was in school). I don't know what it is, I just like sex. I like it when guys fuck, I like it when we make out. I just like feeling wanted. I'm not sure if it's a sex addiction or something, but there have been days before where I would just lie in bed and do nothing but ""the deed"" consecutively , by myself of course; maybe 4-5 times before I get up out of bed? It's weird. Once I'm determined / in this sexualised state, nothing will stop me from achieving what I want. 
 In the past I've driven 2 hours away to meet with a guy, even sneaking out in all hours of the morning, i.e. midnight to like 3AM. I've had one night where I slept with three different guys in the same night. I don't know why I do it, apart from it feeling good. I just know if I'm going to do it, it'll happen. I've ended in some semi-dangerous situations, like meeting guys from Craigslist in a dark park. I was set upon and had to punch / run away. 
 The other bit is the condom bit. The guy that took my virginity didn't use a condom, and neither did most guys I met when I was 15-17. It just never occurred. Like, literally, it was just straight in as is. I did have sex-ed, but maybe it's the Australian system but we just talked about heterosexual sex so I just figured I wouldn't get pregnant, so why bother? It feels good anyway. 
 That kind of thought followed me throughout my teenage years until I hit 18 and realised what had transpired, and I genuinely just assumed I must have HIV. I'm a pretty cluey individual, so I figured, if I never get checked, I'll never be told I have HIV, so then I can tell guys I'm clean because I've never actually had it proven that I had it, so I didn't want to get tested. The other thing was I was still denying my homosexuality at that point in time, despite having been with 50 guys or so. I was in the closet and lied to myself. I tricked myself into being straight. 
 Anyway, don't worry, that phase of my life was short and I did end up getting checked once I found out about these sexual health clinics that you can go to anonymously. First time I went, results came back and I had everything (except HIV and herpes). I was shocked. But I was treated and got over it. 
 For some reason I still slept with guys bareback. I don't know why, it was just normal for me. The other guy would never bring it up so I assumed why not? I'm thinking it's also linked to my lack of self esteem, which meant I really wanted to please the guy so he wouldn't reject me or something. 
 Anyway... moving forward. The same kind of behaviour transpired up until recently. Why you ask? Well, I kinda just realised how stupid I was in doing all this. It was only when I came here on Reddit and explained my story that it made sense. 
 Since I was in the closet, none of my friends knew -- sorry, correction, they were sure I was gay but just played along with it because they didn't want me to get upset. So I didn't have anyone close to tell them about my sex-capades, no-one to judge, no-one to open up to. I had free reign over this ""person"" that I became, the sex addicted barebacker. 
 Now I'm worried no guy will want me because, I mean, who would? I've been with so many guys. It's embarrassing and makes me sad when I think about it, and I have no idea now it got this bad. I can't feel like I can truly be me around people because I'm scared they will judge me. 
 Someone in the other thread said I was a classic example of behavioural economics, in that, I didn't see the risk in barebacking / didn't care. It's almost subconscious. I just don't understand why I do it / continue to do it (sometimes). The same way I would literally study for an exam the night before even if I had a whole week off. My mind just doesn't want to do what's right for me, it's all about gratuitous pleasure. I guess I don't have much willpower. 
 I don't know who or where to turn to. How do I change?
I can see and believe that if I keep this up, I will end up with HIV or something worse. But at the same time I just let all logic fly out the window when I'm making out with a guy and he's about to stick it in. Even worse if I'm on amyl, it's just like ""fuck, let's do it"". I just don't understand, like FUCK. What is wrong with me?","I sleep around a lot because I feel lonely, and I bareback because I want people to like me. Now I'm worried no-one will like me because of it. I think it's also because I don't have any willpower and succumb to any quick fix. How do I stop?",22,M,confession
"So, /r/relationships, I've been happily attached at the hip to my girlfriend for just shy of 6 years now.  She's always sort of been a night owl -- I sleep around 11, she sleeps around 1 or 3.  But this past summer it's gone to some new extremes.  As a good example, I woke up this morning to get ready for work and found her sitting on gchat because she hadn't gone to sleep yet. 
 I work for my father's HVAC company during the latter part of the summer because he's paying my way through school and also getting older, so he can use the help.  It's a 9-to-somewhere-around-5 job and incredibly exhausting in the August heat, especially because he tends to get busy around this time.  He does work for a college and has to prep everything in the last week or so; the workers there are too lazy to check the equipment until the last minute.  So, it's 7 PM right now and she still hasn't woken up.  She sleeps around 12 hours a day because during school she lets herself build up a sleep debt, staying up until 3 AM and then getting up for morning classes.  After a few weeks of putting up with this, I'm starting to get a bit pissy. 
 She's very slow to wake up to begin with -- it takes her around 30 minutes to an hour if I stop by while she's still asleep.  Because I can't get her to care about my limited time to go out, our weekends have been shot to shit.  I usually try to give her until noon to wake up, but she takes so goddamn long to get up we can't really do anything.  I live in a suburb of the city year-round (except when my dad needs me to work), and frequently plans to go spend a day in the city have been shot to shit just because she can't sleep on a regular schedule. 
 I feel like trying to ask her to change the way she sleeps is kind of impossible giving that she's gone completely nocturnal, but I'm also worried I'm a little bit obsessive or at least inflexible.  But blue-collar work from 9-5 really provides a huge physical drain for me (on top of this, I'm a track runner training during the off-season, so between lifting and track workouts my backbeating labor runs until around 7).  Maybe it's just because I'm exhausted all the time, but I'm finding out how easily something like sleep can fuck up a relationship.  I literally have almost no contact with her during the day. 
 The times I do speak to her about it, I feel like she's very dismissive.  At one point, I was supposed to take her to lunch with a professor I've been doing lab work with for the earlier part of the summer, but she overslept so I had to leave her at home.  When I brought up to her how upset we both were (he really likes her), she said she didn't regret staying up late the night before because she got a lot of work done (she's an artist working on commission).  I hate to ask to cut into her work time, because she feels like night is when she works best, but I don't know how to have a relationship with someone who has elected to be unconscious most of the time.  I know it's a bitch to just turn your sleeping habits around, but I fear she's settled in enough to decide not to make the effort.  So, after all that text -- what options do you think we have, reddit?","girlfriend is turned into a vampire, nocturnal relationship ceases to function.",25,M,relationships
"Dude, I have to chime in here and say I was faced with the same situation... 15 years ago.  Ever since, I've been ""cleaning up the pieces"" from the wreck that ensued by not going with my strength in music.  ...Still suffering as a result of having been afraid of the consequences of not choosing to be a ""good boy"" and do what my family wanted me to do.  I listened to them decide for me, cuz I was scared and not strong. 
 Granted, THEIR intentions are good - but that's all it is... THEIR's (colored by their experiences and dreams for you), not necessarily yours (remember, you are an individual with your own purpose to fulfill).  And, of course, ""good intentions pave the path to hell."" 
 As parents, they're trying to protect you - they don't see you yet as a young man.  Protecting you will backfire.  Ultimately, you're at a turning-point in your life, where you have to now step up as a young man and assert your authentic self/who you are.  Related:  ""a ship is safe in harbor, but is that what a ship is made for?"" - anonymous 
 The music will never die in you, my friend - and everything else will never be as rewarding, no matter how much you're making.  Everything else will just be ""killing time"" - fucking mundane, and everyone ""normal"" in your non-music world will be just as lame, living it up for Costco, coffee, and cubicles. 
 It's a bleak picture, but once you go down that path...  you're talking at least 4 years of your life, tens of g's gone, and working your ass off shuffling paper with people who have zero connection to making music.  If it sounds soul-crushing - it is. 
 If you hear the music biz can be detrimental to your health, consider the alternative of sitting on your ass 5 days/wk, eating out mostly, coffee for breakfast, then ending your day sitting on your ass trying to escape in front of a tv or at a bar - or hell, maybe both! 
 On a brighter note, I've realized the reality being that if you're passionate and strong about something, go do it/tap into that energy and the money and fulfillment will come - it'll be a natural (not forced) extension of who you are, GENUINEly.  So you'll find a way to make money doing it.  It's a no-brainer.  Also, ""who you know"" is king, and it already sounds like you're connected (= future, potential business connections... customers, partners, whatever).  It would be a waste to let all of that work you've done go and not honored it. 
 Go with your soul and you'll have wellbeing.  Go against it, it'll be a constant fight/struggle/dissonance - nothing will ever feel like it ""fits"" or that you ""fit.""  The longer this goes on, the more damage it causes psychologically, relationship-wise, and, ultimately, physically.

"A little about me: I'm 35, work professionally, own my own home, etc. I've always been somewhat ""high strung,"" but have been able to manage my inner-stresses for the most part. I'm pretty active. I get about fairly regularly, and work out 5 or 6 days a week, which I've always found to be relaxing. 
 Last Wednesday, I was lifting at the gym - nothing particularly heavy - but at the end of my set, I started to get tunnel vision, felt extremely dizzy, and my extremities started tingling. I immediately grabbed my water bottle and sat on a couch stationed near the locker room. When the dizziness didn't go away after 10 minutes, then 20 minutes, I began to worry. I had to call my girlfriend and ask her to leave work to get me and take me to an urgent care facility. It took around 2 hours to see a doctor, and by that time, I had finally calmed down quite a bit. They ran a series of tests (blood pressure, hooked me up to an EKG, took my blood - which later came back as normal), but never found anything. I chalked it up to ""something I ate"" and set out to go about my normal life. 
 The next morning, I got up as I normally would and started my normal route to work, which is about 20 minutes and about half highway driving. As soon as I got on the highway, I started to get anxious. I was feeling dizzy, felt like I was gasping for air, and I could feel my heart pounding through the top of my skull and ears. I immediately got off the highway at the first exit and decided it would be best to stick to the side streets. I was still anxious, but not like I was on the highway. 
 Thursday and Friday, I thought I'd best take the surface roads to work, thinking about what happened on the highway. I resigned myself to rest HARD over the weekend, and hopefully get everything out of my system. I didn't leave the house except to take my dogs for runs. This morning, I could feel my stress rising as it came time to drive to work. Sure enough, I felt extremely anxious the whole way, but not to the point of ""panic"" as I'd experienced before. I kept telling myself throughout the day that whatever was going on was all in my head and that I'd be fine by the time I had to drive home. When I left work, I felt mostly fine. Until I entered the highway. I tried to fight the anxiety, but it came on stronger and stronger the longer I was on the highway. Finally, it came to the point where I had to either pull over entirely or go another couple of exits until mine. I kept going and made it to my exit. As soon as I pulled off the highway, I felt a little better. The rest of the drive home was stressful, but again, not ""panic"" level. 
 I'm honestly completely lost here and don't know what to do. I've never dealt with this before, so I don't know if I should just rest a couple of more days? See a doctor? (If so, what kind?) Keep making myself drive despite feeling like I'm going to freak out/die/whatever - or worse - hurt myself or someone else by losing control of my vehicle? Any advice would be sincerely appreciated. I'm absolutely beside myself.","I've been having what I think are panic attacks. Lately, it's occurring when driving - mostly on the highway.

"Hi guys. I have jealousy issues that I know are not okay. Or am not sure if they are okay. So I guess my question is, is this type of feeling okay or normal? 
 I am a 22 year old male who just recently got into a relationship with a 22 year old female. The girl and I have been friends for pretty long (6 years) and have been walking the line between friendship and more than that for just as long. Only two months ago have we decided to start dating officially (BF/GF).
The problem here is, I am an overly jealous person. I'm not sure where this problem stems from, but I haven't told anybody about it. My girlfriend doesn't know I'm jealous of her because I haven't told her because I know this type of jealousy isn't okay. 
 She recently traveled far away (tropical Asia) for a long time with her girlfriends. I know deep down inside that she would do nothing to hurt me. I am positive of that because I've known her for so long and have seen what she's like in relationships. That's not what I'm worried about. For some reason, I am just jealous of her. I am jealous that she's having tons of fun with her girlfriends without me. I am jealous that she's going on all these adventures in a foreign country that I wish I could go on with her. I am jealous that she went skinny dipping with (only) her girlfriends at 3:30 AM her time so there wasn't anybody around to see (although she probably was spotted, which also makes me jealous). The bottom line is, I'm just jealous that she's having fun while I'm cooped up at home with nothing to do except work and go to the gym and occasionally hang out with friends. What I do pales in comparison with what she's doing right now and I can't stand it. 
 I know this type of jealousy isn't okay, but I can't help it. When she texts me and tells me she loves me and she would do nothing to hurt me, I believe it. And she texts me all these photos of all the fun things she does and I love that she does that because it shows that she wants to share her life with me. She tells me she doesn't talk to the local guys there because she only wants me and she misses me and I believe her. But every time she tells me she's having all this fun, I get so jealous and resentful that it gives me a headache and a tight chest. 
 I have never expressed any of this jealousy though. This is the first time she's traveling long distance and long term away from me (even during our friendship), and I have supported her the whole way. Every time she texts me photos of her at the beach and at the pool and drinking with her girlfriends, I reply wholeheartedly and tell her I'm so happy that she's having the time of her life. And I am happy that she's happy. But I still can't escape this feeling of jealousy and resentment. 
 Help :( I really need help. I know it's wrong to feel like this. You should be happy that your SO is happy. And I am. But you shouldn't feel jealous and resentful also. Should you?","I am happy that my SO is having the time of her life traveling, but I am also unreasonably jealous of her fun. Can I get some advice?

"Hi all, 
 I'll try to make this as brief as possible since it's rather a long story and you all don't want to be reading massive walls of text. 
 I'm 23, currently on holidays in Europe with my best friends, having just beat cancer, graduated top of my class and received a job-offer with an amazing staring salary. I should be on top of the world. 
 Here I sit, however, unable to smile or be happy or really care about anything. It all stems from a girl I had dated for six years. We broke up at the beginning of this year after an awful Christmas together (her breaking up with me, over the phone). Since this, I have set /r/GetMotivated as my home-page, I've followed all of the advice - lost 1/7th of my body-weight through exercise daily, got really good (for me) results in my exams this year, graduated top of the class, tried to accomplish everything I thought might help me to move on and any advice I thought might help that I read on this subreddit. I've spoke to friends at length about my situation (they are sick of hearing about it!) and family too. Even tried counselling when I was briefly diagnosed with cancer just after the break-up. It wasn't for me (neither the cancer nor the counselling!). 
 I just can't move on though. 
 All I can do is check her Twitter, Facebook every so often. Even today, while sitting in the private pool of our hotel, surrounded by friends, when I got a call saying I had this amazing job offer, I feigned a smile, laughed and pretended to be happy. Deep down all I could think was ""Yeah, this is all you've worked towards, all your accomplishable goals accomplished now - but at the end of the day, all you want is her, and not even accomplishing all these goals has brought you one step closer to the happiness she gave you"". 
 What can I do to get over this guys? I've tried everything - gym, talking to people, counselling, diving into study, taking up new hobbies - hell, I'm even moving to another city next week for my job. I can't muster up any enthusiasm or encouragement anymore though. I am just broken. 
 I'm really, really sad. I don't think I am depressed - I still do things, get out of bed, feign interest and enthusiasm sometimes. Sometimes I am even genuinely happy for brief periods, but mostly I do things out of habit and hope they will improve how I see things. 
 So far, however, and in fact,","all I am is a Peter Gibbons - ever since my long-term girlfriend broke up with me, every single day of my life has been worse than the day before it. So that means that every single day that you see me, that's on the worst day of my life. This is despite implementing all the changes and suggestions people usually make when someone is in this situation. 
 Thanks for taking the time to read this, I really appreciate any help or advice :)

"The backstory: 
 This could take all day so I'll keep it brief. I am female in my early 20s. 
 
 My whole life I've had issues with my weight and self-esteem. I became very depressed and insecure after puberty and that has only escalated over time. 
 
 Upon graduating high school I began using cocaine here and there. I had moved to a new city to attend college. Getting my next hit became much more important than keeping my grades up, but I would not admit to being addicted. I dropped all of my classes. 
 
 During this time I was sexually assaulted by a peer. The shock of the incident left me pretending it didn't happen. 
 
 I began browsing for ideas on how to make quick cash in order to afford my expensive habit. The most successful ones seemed to be in one area: sex. My new town was known for its young money and ""sugar daddies"". I thought,  why not? What's the worst that could happen to me now? 
 
 I was an escort with an agency for a short time, but selling my 'companionship' was not for me. However, the money wasn't a lie. 
 
 I managed to 360 my life around and quit drugs and selling myself altogether. 
 
 
 Presently: 
 I am left at square one in dealing with all of this. 
 
 Being an escort was a way for me to validate my worth.  If somebody was willing to pay for me, I had to be good for something, right? 
 
 The thought that plagues my mind is that I was too weak to prevent rape from happening. I know that blaming myself is not the correct action, and for the most part I have made progress in recovering from the trauma. 
 
 I get very insecure during sex. I dislike my body and often feel ashamed of it. Sometimes, I can't get over feeling of being 'used'. 
 
 I recently interviewed and received a decent job position, but was unable to hold it and had to make up an excuse. The reason was that my anxiety and depression have increased to a point where I an unable to get out of bed for days. 
 
 My university debut was a total failure. I am unemployed and uneducated. But I still have work ethic and a desire to learn. 
 
 
 I am working on exercising regularly to improve my fitness and mood. I have a loving partner that accepts me and my mistakes and has been amazingly supportive. I want to take small steps in order to improve my future. I don't want to be unsuccessful and unhappy any longer, and I definitely don't want to keep beating myself up about it.",How do I stop hating myself and my body and find that inner peace?,20,F,getting_over_it
"This is a throwaway account for the usual reasons. I haven't posted here before, but I'd love some non-biased thoughts on my current predicament because I don't feel like I have anyone I can talk to about this. 
 We'll say my name is Owen and I'm 25. I dated this girl we'll call June for three months, she's 21. It was my first real relationship. I'm a bit socially awkward sometimes and it's hard for me to meet people. We live in Oklahoma and it's especially difficult at times to meet eligible single people. We met through a mutual friend and June and I went on dates very frequently for two months before being in a relationship. Then we were in a relationship for three months and really hit it off. We had such great meshing personalities and everything seemed to be going great, but eventually two things brought me to end the relationship. 
 First, I never enjoyed being around her friends. We both mostly hang out with just a few close friends and June's friends were some of the least likable girls I've ever met. I could've gotten over this one in time. 
 Second, I was really indecisive for a lot of the relationship of rather or not I loved her. She's really a great girl and I didn't want to lead her on at any point, I liked being around her so much, but kept feeling like I could do better in some ways, like their was someone better suited for me. I know she liked me for who I was, but I wasn't who I wanted to be yet. I wanted someone to challenge me, inspire me and teach me how to be a better person. I never got that at all from my girlfriend. I gained fifteen pounds and felt like I was learning how to settle down and just be content. It just seemed like in ten years we would be that fat married couple in Oklahoma that never did anything with their lives. 
 I couldn't bring myself to tell her how I felt. I ended up lying to her and telling her that my job was relocating me for awhile and that we should break up for the time being. Even typing that makes me feel like an ass, but at the time I was planning on moving to Indiana. I never ended up moving, but we still live twenty minutes away from each other in separate towns, so we're likely to never run into each other randomly. It's been four months and I've pretty much done nothing but go to the gym and work. I lost forty pounds and I'm in the best shape of my life, but lately I've been thinking of her a lot. I haven't been on a date since we broke up or even attempted to go on one with someone else. We haven't talked in the four months we've been apart, but I sometimes think about driving to her hometown and going to the coffee shop she frequents to maybe run into her. My birthday was yesterday and I was hoping she would send me a text or something and then maybe we would get to talking again, but alas - no text. I'm wondering what I should do now. Does this sound like a case of me just being lonely or did I majorly fuck up? 
 I recently re-watched clerks and there's a scene  (spoilers)  with these two quotes in it: ""What's a good plate with nothing on it?"" and ""You know, there's a million fine looking women in the world, dude, but they don't all bring you lasagna at work. Most of 'em just cheat on you."" I think that's what triggered me missing her so much lately. Thanks for taking the time to read this, any feedback would be appreciated.","broke up with girlfriend four months ago, but lately she's been on my mind a lot",25,M,relationships
"I think I may be screwed here. There were obvious solutions available a couple months ago, but I didn't take advantage, and now I think I'm probably in too deep. Apologies in advance for the wall o' text. I'm hoping the vast wisdom of Reddit can help me think of things I haven't thought of already. 
 So, my primary relationship (AKA backstory). And despite the situation I'm about to describe, it is still very much primary. I've been with my boyfriend (hereafter BF) for five and a half years, living together for three and a half. We've fully intended to spend our lives together (marriage, kids, etc) basically since we got together. Pretty much the only reason we haven't gotten married already is our financial circumstance. I'm 25 and starting out in my career, and he's 31, finishing a doctorate. So, you know. And he truly is amazing. We're both classical musicians, so he understands when I come back from a rehearsal and bitch about bad conductors, and I love talking to him about our musical life. We have the same sick sense of humor, and we've known each other for so long that we have the incredible shorthand that only best friends can use. I actually can't imagine life without him. It just... doesn't even exist in my mind. 
 Now here's the fun part. He's always been into the idea of me being with other guys. Not cuckolding exactly, because he's NOT into the humiliation aspect. But he gets turned on at the idea (and the reality) of other men wanting (and having) what he has. We've explored that in various ways--a threesome with possibly the best unicorn ever, one night stands on my part where he gets to reclaim me immediately, etc. Basically all one-offs, no other relationships. And generally, it's been fantastic. 
 But last summer (2013), we both finished grad school coursework and were able to move to the city of our choice. Of course, our finances took a hit. I've been the primary wage earner since then, but I took a much more fulfilling but lower paying job this September. We knew money would be rough at the outset last summer, so I had already floated the idea of finding a sugar daddy. BF was into it, so I made an account on Seeking Arrangement right when we moved... and then pretty much ignored it until I realized how broke I was going to be when my new job started this year. 
 When I made the account, I had a vision in my mind of what a SD/SB relationship should be. She, the sugar baby, should be young, beautiful, and ready to bring all the freedom and lightness that youth implies back into the life of her SD. The SD, on the other hand, should be mature, stable, successful, but tired of the complexities that middle age brings. The whole thing should be a fun, equal(ish) exchange, without any hefty attachment. To me, that all meant that I should put ""single"" on my account. In my mind, I was free enough to justify that label--I could go out, have fun, do sexy things, take gifts in various forms. Any more explanation than that would be overcomplicated. What's more, saying I had an open relationship might very well attract the kind of guy who WAS interested in cuckolding BF, and that wasn't the point at all. I didn't intend to ever lie--if anyone had asked, I fully intended to answer honestly. I just didn't give any reason, on my profile, to ask. I simply mentioned that I actively did NOT want serious relationship and left it at that. 
 Since you're all smart people out there in Reddit-land, I'm sure you can see where this is going. 
 The SD I did eventually find has surprised me at every turn. He's the only guy I actually met in person--plenty asked, but they all disqualified themselves within a couple of messages. He's younger, more interesting, sexier than I expected. We met for drinks and ended up spending four hours talking. We met for dinner and I ended up going home at 6 AM--without sleep. He's absolutely brilliant, apparently actually famous within his discipline (which, yes, I found out through internet stalking--thanks, Google!), but he never talks down and treats me as an intellectual equal. (I think I surprised him at first--he kept stopping in the middle of our first conversation over drinks and saying, ""You ARE smart!"" Not in a condescending way, just genuine surprise. Hello, ego boost.) And he never makes me feel like a burden or a mooch--he says he's happy to be supporting someone with passion and ambition--but he takes me to do all sorts of things that I drool over but could never afford to do on my own. And he enjoys them too, which is even better. I just really enjoy his company and I have a great time every time I see him. We're really starting to like each other. Despite the beginning premise, I think it's actually going just as well as (or better than) other relationships I've had. 
 He's been pretty forthcoming with his past--relationship history, sexual history, everything. He was wary at first, but he confessed a couple of small things to me that made no difference, and I think it made him really feel safe about being honest with me. I, on the other hand, have definitely had to hold back on reciprocating because SO MUCH of my relationship history is my current BF. I've also had to be vague about my living situation, since BF and I live together in a one bedroom. He knows generally where I live and that I have a roommate, but that's it. It's NOT a good feeling. And I know he can tell I'm holding back. He's made allusions to figuring out my deep dark secrets, and last time I saw him, he made a very-non-joke kind of joke about how my other sugar daddies probably pay me more. I, of course, said I didn't have time for other sugar daddies--which is absolutely true--but it felt too close to a lie for comfort. He did ask me once if I was seeing anyone else, and I said yes (which, I'm sure, is why he thinks I might have other SDs), but that's as far as that went. 
 Now, I know I'm just putting off the inevitable. Part of me hoped that I would be able to just let the SD relationship run its course without ever disclosing (because that would be easier and I'm clearly a coward), but I don't think that's gonna happen. I like SD too much, and we're getting too close for that to really work. I know I should have expected feelings to come into play, but I really didn't. I guess I should address this sooner rather than later, come clean on my own terms rather than waiting for the explosion... But I am scared. I'm scared enough that I've considered even doing a slow roll-out, maybe confessing that my roommate is a sort-of ex (who can't afford to move out) who I could ""get back together with"" at a later date... but that goes beyond lies of omission into actual real lies, and I don't want to do that. 
 (Ugh. This whole thing makes me sound kind of terrible, doesn't it?) 
 So, my question to you, dear Reddit, is this. How can I possibly approach this so that, maybe, just maybe, I don't end up hurting anyone? I've got to believe there's a way. I just need your help to figure it out.","I got a sugar daddy but never mentioned my open relationship with my BF of over 5 years.

"I'm bisexual! 
 It has been soooooooooo confusing all this time. I read and read and read so much. ""Well, yeah, I think I like boys but girls are cute but boys are too but also girls but boys as well but girls ar-"" and that's kinda what has been going on in my head. 
 Today I caught myself looking at one of my classmates and sighing. I've never thought about doing anything with her, she's just super nice and sweet and amazing and she's a bit shorter than me (which is rare, I'm 5'2) and maybe I want to hug her. And also there was that girl at one Halloween party a few years back and she was wonderful and cute and we slept on one bed because there was no room and I was confused for the next week why I felt so good around her. 
 On the boys' side... Well I haven't had as much encounters of the same theme but I occasionally have I guess you could say ""small crushes"". Usually I'm a little nervous around them but I can still talk, do not worry! Also the boys in my class are not the best material. I might be going more to the gay side but I still like boys! 
 I've been wondering what the heck is going on for years. I've read about sexuality more than I've read for any schoolwork I had had to do. I went through many sexualities and for a long period I thought I was ace. After a while I decided to leave it, too much of a headache. And today while I was going home from school I thought of my classmate and something just happened. Like I had to stop walking for a few seconds. I looked up at the sky, the clouds from the snow this morning still hasn't parted. And I thought to myself  ""What a wonderful world""  ""HOLY. SHIT."" That was such a surprise. And I was really happy about it. 
 That's a milestone for me. After I cut my hair in May last year I started to explore one very different side of me. I've felt the change since 7th grade, I'm 11th now, and I've been trying to find myself all that time. Eh, puberty yeah, but it's just very difficult for me to accept something without someone telling me it's true. I lack confidence. 
 I feel like I've taken a step towards a better me and finding out I'm bisexual lifted a huge weight off my shoulders. I'm not stopping here, I still have so much more to do but now I understand myself a little bit better. Of course, I will discover a lot of things about me thought my entire life but I really want to set off with concrete steps.

"My mother in-law is a perfectly nice person. She's not a monster-in-law by any means.  But I find myself constantly annoyed my her and I don't know how to stop it. 
 A little back story.  She's young(55), had my husband when she was 20. Divorced his dad pretty early on in my husband's life and never remarried.  It was a shotgun wedding and knowing them both now, I can understand why that marriage did not last. He is very superficial, selfish, and thinks he's in his 30s.  She is homely, insecure and kind of reminds me of one of those people you'd see on What Not To Wear.  She doesn't really have any close friends. 
 My husband is very much like his dad and so even though he has a great job, and we've created a beautiful family, she constantly gives him a hard time about not calling enough, and his abrasive personality.  She mostly communicates through text and more often than not, it's in a very passive aggressive, woe-is-me way.  Overemphasizing that she doesn't want to inconvenience us but that it would be nice if we'd allow her to come over to see her grandchildren.  Very guilt-trippy - like somehow we've made her feel like she's not welcome. 
 When she's around my large family she gets melancholy. She only has 1 sibling and no extended family.  I had a party once and found her quietly sobbing in one of the bedrooms.  When I asked her what was wrong, she said she missed her parents (who by the way are fine and retired living in another state.)  I tried to sympathize but I was just like, why don't you call them? 
 Another time, she was playing with one of my daughters when she was just learning to walk and my daughter took a tumble and started crying.  I ran downstairs and grabbed my daughter and was just soothing her and noticed that my MIL was CRYING quietly in the corner.   I  wasn't even crying... 
 Finally, and this is so cruel of me to even say, but I care about the way I look. I take care of myself and my appearance.  I try to be fashionable and wear make up and generally just look nice. And she's a frump. She doesn't care AT ALL about how she looks. There's even a running joke about how she doesn't comb her hair. Her clothes all don't fit her, and she has about 5 pieces of clothing on rotation (and money is not the issue). 
 Ultimately, I think that she's pathetic. She constantly plays the victim, she acts like everything she asks is a huge imposition, constantly feels sorry for herself and frankly, it really just pushes my buttons. At first I kind of felt sorry for her too but as I got to know her, it just irritated me more and more.  And now, the sight of her just ignites apathy within me.  I'd like to think I'm more sympathetic but the more this woman plays this victim card, the less tolerant I get. 
 She's not a bad person, and I wish I could really truly like her but I don't know how to overcome these feelings that I have.  Any advice? And please don't just call me mean, I know it's mean, but I can't help how I feel.",My mother in law is a victim in her own mind and it just aggravates me.

"This is my first post on TIFU and is kind of a serious one but thought i'd share it with you all to get your comments and thoughts on this. 
 Well a little backstory then, me (29) met a girl called Lisa (33) at a party in Michigan, using fake names of course. We really really hit it off, talking, cuddling, kissing for hours at this party, now I had to travel home straight after which which aint no thing, but we had arranged to meet up the following weekend to go out for a drink. 
 I travelled an hour to the city where she lives and we had an amazing weekend with each other, we get on real good, more than any other girl ive met and Lisa says the same things to me too. 
 Now the 2nd time I go to meet her she fires me a text message on the same day saying shes going travelling for 2 years to europe, which i was obviously a little bit bummed out by, but wasn't really a big deal as we've only seen each other a couple of times. 
 Fast forward a couple of weekends after spending more time together and she starts to get a bit cagey with me, saying she does not know what she wants etc etc because of this travel thing mainly. 
 We forget about that and talk about it and say we are just going to see how it goes and enjoy time before she travels. Since then its got a bit deeper and feelings are now involved and shes now done this a couple of times then we talk about it and just continue with it again. 
 It's just really weird because we have both never met anyone like each other before and it just feels right, i just think shes hiding some things idk but something has been amiss the past week or two. 
 She was acting really weird again last weekend before I went to see her and made me just not look forward to seeing her at all. Then it ended up being an absolutely amazing weekend and she had said, screw it we make it each other happy and there is definitely a connection there so lets jus go for it. She is getting deep feelings too with all this. 
 So i have got some awesome things planned for us over the next couple months, but now im just getting all worried when shes being weird with me its all going to happen again and just not really sure what to do about the whole situation?! 
 never met anyone like this girl before and I know its right but shes so weird with her feels, im just getting worried all the time and im really falling for her now. Just so confused and do not know what to do at all, don't want to let this girl go but also know when she goes to europe il feel terrible too.

"Back when I worked at EB games, kids frequently tried to buy M-rated games when they were not 17 years old. I know I hated that happening to me when I was a kid, but I'd rather not be fired. 
 One day, a kid I know from high school comes in, who I KNOW is 15 or 16 from the grade he's in. We've never been friends. We're constantly at odds because he's an egotistical prick who acts like he's the next Jimi Hendrix while listening exclusively to classic rock. Then he tries to impress and emulate me. It's really absurd, but suffice it to say, I don't like this guy very much. 
 So he comes in and acts all buddy buddy. ""Heeeeeey, LimeJuice, what's up?!"" 
 ""Oh, not much Scott. What can I do for you?"" 
 ""Oh, I just want this game."" 
 And slaps Battlefield on the counter. So I say to him, 
 ""Scott, I  know  you're not 17. Sorry, but I can't sell this to you. You can go get your brother or your mom to come buy it for you, but I could lose my job or get fined a lot of money if I sell this to you."" 
 ""Come on man, aren't we friends?"" (no we're not) ""Besiiiiides, it's not like anyone will know I bought it."" 
 ""Mario (my co-worker, yes, Mario works at a video game store, hardy har har) would know. The other customers would know. Sorry, but the answer is no."" So he turns and huddles with his friends for a minute or two before turning around. 
 ""Can he buy it?"" Scott asks, pointing to his friend. 
 ""Yeah, if he's 17. Do you have ID?"" 
 He hands me a BC drivers license (I live in Alberta) with a person who looks almost exactly like him. I almost say ""okay,"" when I notice the birthday. 1991. I was born in 1993. There's no way he's older than me. So I ask how old he is. 
 ""Twenty."" 
 I really just had to hear him say it. 
 ""No, you're not fucking 20. You're in grade 10. Do you have any other ID?"" 
 So he says no, and I ask for his wallet. After a little rifling through it, I find a McDonalds employee card with the name Jack. The name on the ID is Zack. So I kick him out of the store, keeping the driver's license. What I figure happened was that his brother got an Alberta license and was about to cut his old one in half (there was a cut mark going about 1/5 of the way through it) when he stopped him and asked for it as a fake ID. I'm actually just glad that I caught him with it before he started trying to use it for alcohol, because he could probably get in a lot of shit for that, but it was also  really  satisfying to kick him out, and hilarious to see him pretend he was a 20 year old 10th grader.","kid who looks about 12 tries to use fake ID to buy Battlefield, claiming he's 20.",21,M,AskReddit
"I can give both sides to this; ugly and ""attractive"". 
 At the start of university I was very overweight (30kg) and had horrible dress sense, due to my fat face I looked like a sumo wrestler and girls wouldn't give me the time of day. It was very depressing stuff. 
 This was in my first year of university and I'd lose weight throughout the year slowly gaining confidence. In my last term of the first year I bought some new fashionable clothes, suddenly due to my weight loss and nice clothes I found myself being checked out in the local supermarket, which was a very nice feeling. 
 Fast forward to now where I am at the end of my second year in university, the attention is unbelievable, i've been given fantastic compliments such as; ""You look like a Gucci model"" (you wouldn't believe how happy that made me). ""Hey sexy"" and stuff like that. 
 It's not just attention from girls that I've noticed happening; I've been allowed to get away with more things as an ""attractive"" person than when I was a fat guy. Things such as inappropriate jokes, naughty behaviour (being a mischievous dick).

"When I was a junior in high school, I fell for ""Ryan."" Stupid me told him immediately after our first kiss that I wanted to date him and as a typical 16/17 year old boy, he took off running. I couldn't help how I felt about him - he gave me butterfly flies like no other and I felt on top of the world when I was around him. So I had sex with him to get his attention and make him like me. It didn't work at first (girls, don't follow this), but then he would make promises to me to take me to the movies, out to dinner, and to do anything I wanted. Unfortunately, my parents cut our relationship short when they found out what I was doing and threw me in therapy.During therapy, I was so upset about Ryan - not because of the unmet promises, but because my therapist made me realize I was being used. I was terribly hurt and as a result, I was terrified of Ryan. 
 When school started back up, we didn't speak for the entire semester until December when I had begun dating another guy. I told Ryan how hurt I was by what he did to me. Fast forward to July of the next year and Ryan told me crying how much he thought about what he did and that he was sorry. I accepted his apology and moved on with my life. The next summer, I was so fixated on Ryan to the point it was an unhealthy obsession. My boyfriend threatened to break up with me unless I went back to my therapist for help. I was told everything I was doing and feeling pointed to depression and that I should go see a doctor for a proper diagnosis. My parents refused to believe I had it, thus, I was never officially diagnosed. Two days after seeing my therapist, my boyfriend broke up with me (cheating) and I went to Ryan. Ryan and I would talk, hang out, hook up but we would never talk about our past, how we felt, him crying or me being hurt. School started and after two failed attempts of seeing each other, I gave up and started talking to someone else. 
 Me and that someone else, ""Dan,"" have been dating for 11 months. I love Dan, he's my best friend, he treats me like princess, and we have everything in common. I have ""episodes of depression,"" I called them, where I feel empty, depleted of energy, lonely, worthless etc every 3-4 months and he has experienced 3 of them. During the last one (5 days ago), I experienced one in which I was upset and I obsessing over Ryan the entire time. It's complicated but my depression has gone away but I keep on obsessing over Ryan, our past, and what could have been. I don't know how to stop. I feel like my brain is torturing me - I don't want to feel and think about these things. On top of that, writing this about Ryan has me in tears. I think my feelings for Dan are fading and I don't want them to.

"This is [Roxie]( What breed do you think she is? 
 Roxie is 6. I rescued Roxie when she was ~1.5. It was really clear that she had been abused. I spent a lot of time working with her to show her how to be a dog again. Luckily for me, Rox is actually quite intelligent. 
 I took her to obedience school, one that supposedly specialised in dog aggression and they were.... well, pathetic. They had levels of classes and we blitzed every single 'test' to the next level which really just meant we were passed from trainer to trainer. They had dog aggression classes which I hated and wouldn't go to. (One involved me holding Roxie's attention while another person bought their dog aggressive dog up behind us in a sneaking manner. Disaster when the dog hears them, turns, and there's two dog aggressive dogs face to face. I was ignored when I raised this.) Roxie's obedience is exemplary. She loves to play with other dogs, and has more friends than I do. 
 Roxie has issues saying Hello. Instead of just casually greeting another dog with a 'Hi, what's up?' Roxie barks and carries on like you've threatened to remove bacon from the world. Once she can sniff the dog, she calms down and from that point on there is no problem. It's not excitement, it's definitely more 'aggression', but it's always in the lead up to meeting the dog. Once she meets them there is no fighting, snarling, growling, barking or anything. Off leash there is next to no issue. Maybe 3 seconds of her tensing and then she's fine. 
 I have worked with her extensively using a number of techniques. 
 We've tried walking away. I make her sit and focus on me. I've tried Cesar's method of a poke (this one actually worked but I would NOT recommend it to anyone else). I correct her with the leash, both ends. Adding a ball or toy into the mix is a disaster and makers her too excitable so we don't do that. Spray bottle. Treats. NILIF. I've spent years, a fair bit of $$, countless hours. That's all fine, I love my little pup. She HAS improved. 
 I was in a motorbike accident a few years ago and haven't been as active with her. I have now moved to a new area, in an attempt to get my life back, go to uni, am in a new house. We went to a dog park the other day which was huuuuuuuge. I took us into an area where no one else was but we could see other dogs. Roxie could play and fetch the ball, see a dog and be rewarded for focusing her attention back on me. 
 At parks I am extremely vigilant. An owner started heading in our general direction us so Roxie was recalled, and leashed. The other dog was off leash and headed toward us, circling us while Roxie barked at it. The owner apologised (she was so far away we had to yell) and I said it was fine. Her dog came into our space, and had to run pretty far away from it's owner. He also didn't go back when called. 
 I always put Roxie on her leash when I suspect anyone is coming anywhere near us. I trust her obedience and even her recall. In the past she has proven herself with this. I still feel like I was a bit in the wrong though and definitely didn't appreciate being approached by this other dog who was friendly but uncontrolled and making Roxie worse by circling us and not coming close enough for her to sniff (Note other dogs walked off lead where the owner was and Roxie didnt run to them and they didn't run to us). 
 The thing is, if Roxie was off leash, they would have played. But because she has leash aggression and we have never met this dog, I don't want to get into trouble by having a dog bolt at us and her react badly just this one time off leash. So I put her on the lead and then she definitely does react which results in the other owner removing their dog and Roxie doesn't get to meet anyone new. 
 Do you think it's ok for me to take her to a section of the park that is secluded, where she can go off lead and play by herself, if I am vigilant and leash her at even the slightest hint of a possibility of another dog coming our way? I also want her to see other dogs playing and running and know it's ok.","Dog loves to play but has weird leash aggression/issue saying hello. I want to take her to a big park where other dogs go and let her off leash in a secluded area. 
 Edit: I think I will just stick to leaving her on lead at the park for training purposes just to be safe. Any tips for training? Has anyone ever come across this form of leash aggression?",28,F,dogs

"I live in Chinatown, NYC, and one thing I always tell folks who find people here rude is that they aren't rude- it's just an ENTIRELY different culture than ours in the US. (For reference: I live in a part of Chinatown where I'm one of the only non-chinese people in a few block radius. Most of my neighbors are fairly recent immigrants from Fujian province, so this is where I draw my conclusions from. I've been here 5 years.) 
 Some things are the same- we both say ""Thank You"" after a shop transaction, but some things are totally different, they don't step out of each others way on a crowded street or say excuse me- it's not that they're being rude, it's just something that is not done in their culture. Even if you bump into each other they typically don't apologize, or even acknowledge that it happened- it's just part of daily life. It isn't that they're being rude, it's more like it's just accepted in mainland China that sidewalk crowding happens and occasionally you bump into each other- no need to address it. 
 In my neighborhood, pulling down your toddler's pants to help them piss in the gutter is totally normal, but if you wear a crop top on the street, everyone is going to stare wide eyed. Pissing in the gutter is normal in Fujian, a belly-button baring crop top is not. 
 While I'm on the staring topic, my friends frequently cite getting stared at as one of their least favorite parts of Chinatown, but the longer I'm here the more I notice, it's not just girls in short shorts that get stared at, it's literally anything out of place. A tree was getting planted on my block yesterday- there were no less than 15 people watching. Later in the day I walked by a construction crew laying sidewalk, they'd attracted another 12 or so people to watch that. I'm talking old folks, young folks, parents explaining the process to their kids, people in their 30s. Yeah, when I wear loud fashionable clothing Chinese dudes totally stare at me, but they also stared with the same amount of fascination the day I carried home a 7 Foot tall roll of astroturf and struggled to fit it through my front door. 
 Then there's the spitting- there's a lot of down here. It tends to come with a really distinctive throat clearing first- it's pretty noisy. And there's no one demographic of chinese folks who spit in my neighborhood- kids, adults, men, women, it's pretty universal. But again, like pissing in the gutter, spitting in public is just not a big deal in mainland China. It's not something you have to apologize after. 
 It's also relevant to remember China hasn't always been ""open"" to western tourism and trade, and it's really only in recent years that China has grown a large middle class who have the rights and money to travel outside their country. It's not that rude tourists are poor people from poor villages, but rather that they're sometimes people who've only become middle class or earned the money to travel in the last few decades. What I'm saying is, they're still learning the ropes of being a polite tourist. 
 Additionally, all cultures have behaviors other cultures find rude. There are certain behaviors frequently exhibited by some European tourists that enrage your average New Yorker. And there are plenty of things some Americans do in other countries to upset the locals. 
 EDIT:","Some of the Chinese tourists ""rude"" behavior can be accounted for the fact that the same behavior isn't rude in China, and their new middle class is still learning the ropes of polite international travel.",30,F,explainlikeimfive
"My boyfriend and I are 20, and we've been dating for 11 months. 
 I don't know what to do. 
 I hate concerts. To not only have a hard case of ADD and social anxiety stemming from my incredibly terrible case of depression, i hate going. I like music, but I'm small. People step on me, people hit me, push me, and i cant even see anything.  So a typical concert consists of me getting hit in the face, stepped on, and staring at the back of someone's shirt. I don't understand how people enjoy themselves and are dancing, and i don't. It seems weird and unnatural. And i feel depressed because everyone has a good time and i cant. 
 My boyfriend loves concerts. 
 The first one, i got sick. Despite me always telling him to stay, he makes me leave and he gets all sad and cries afterwards. The second time, he made me try ecstasy, and i freaked out, and again.... We left. I told him I'd be okay and for us to stay and that i just needed to sit for a bit because the crowd was scaring me, but he made me leave. Again, he cried. The third concert, i got sick, but we stayed. Mainly because i didn't tell him i was sick afterwards and left to take care of my sickness when i went to the bathroom and held the dying pain the entire time. Friday night, i got elbowed in the eye. The main guy came on, and it caused me to cry (from pain) and have a panic attack.  I tried to hide it and just stay there till it passed. My boyfriend turned me around to ask if i could see; and saw me tearing up. (I cant hide my emotions. It's too difficult. ) and then he's put in a bad mood, and keeps trying to get me to leave so we can go home, while i stay put and say no. I try to dance with him, while trying to calm down, and he got so angry he starts yelling, and finally we go home. I didn't want to leave because again i fuck up. 
 We went home and he cried because he really wanted to see the guy. Every concert we go to, he always really wants to see them. I have no interest in concerts. Even if i like that person too, i don't really care. He doesn't want to take someone else or go alone. So i go. When I feel sick, he won't stay. He makes me leave even if I can go home alone by myself so he can enjoy himself. And again i feel like shit.  I try to stick it out for him, and i feel like a huge disappointment. He then starts crying and saying i need to calm down and to try to not be so negative all the time. LIKE I HAVE A CHOICE. I WISH I COULD BE HAPPY.  And i finally felt alone. I feel truly alone because I thought he understood I can't just turn on my happiness. 
 I got very depressed and suicidal and felt the need to self harm. I normally don't get that bad.  Since then he has been very cold towards me but still demanding attention from me. 
 I don't know what to do. He wants me to go to another concert in two weeks....I don't even know if we are still going. 
 He doesn't talk, he doesn't want me to take him out or do anything fun. I am still incredibly depressed. I feel terrible. I feel worthless and a disappointment. I guess since he's at my apartment still, it's not as bad.  He has his own apartment but stays at mine all the time. 
 I'm really depressed. He's the only person besides family who knows im depressed and I can't even talk to him.  People just think I'm really shy.  He just wants me to comfort him, cuddle him, but does nothing for me. I'm sad too. I guess I deserve to feel this way, but I can't help but feel like things are going to end. I hate waiting around because I'd rather be dumped already and get on with the pain instead of being paranoid and waiting for it.  I can't talk to him about it because he just gets depressed and cries again. I'm going home after my exams this week to get away and havent told him. 
 And before anyone mentions I need to seek help, I've tried.  I was going somewhere on campus, and they put me on 7 or 8 anti depressants that didn't work, and the last one gave me seizures. I ended up in the hospital and broke my nose.  I went back and told her what happened, and she said the medication DOESNT cause it. (IT DOES.) and i went back on, only to have a seizure again, and almost bleed to death. (I called the campus nurse and she told me to let me bleed it out, after i told her I was bleeding out cups, and i eventually just called 911 before i passed out)  i went a few weeks back when I heard that doctor had left, but since they had already ""helped me"" they can't take me again. I'm currently trying to find a doctor nearby where it'll take my insurance and is close by.","I hate concerts. They cause major anxiety and panic attacks, yet my bf insists we continue going.

"Hey, guys 
 Sorry for all the information I'm about to give you. I just really want some help from people who know all the facts. 
 I am 21f and my boyfriend is 22m. We go to the same college, and have been dating for over a year, and we live together. When we first started dating, we had sex a lot. It seems like everyday that we hung out ended in sex. It was awesome. Things started to slow down a little bit a few months ago. When we started living together... 
 He is a Christian dude, except not very extreme. He turned to religion when his mom passed away last year. He was ""saved"" at a church camp he chaperoned over last summer, and is truly believing and passionate about God. He used to sometimes cry and say he wished I would just be ""saved."" I've told him that I feel silly about it and that I'm just not ready for it. So he has put it behind. I go to church with him and never try to disrespect what he believes and we are both okay with that. 
 Except when it comes to sex. 
 I am on birth control. It has been 2 years since I had an implanon put in. I never get a period. At first my sex drive was extremely decreased. I went a year without sex and was completely okay. But now my sex drive is through the roof. I constantly think about sex and am always horny and ready to go! Me and my boyfriend have great sex and I love it. The only problem is now that he won't have sex with me. 
 The first month we lived together, our sex was normal as ever. It was everyday and sometimes twice a day. Now it is once every two weeks if I am lucky. 
 Every time I try to prompt sex with him, he says that we do it too much and he is ""straying from the lord."" He will keep saying this until he reaches the brink of his horniness I guess. Then he'll have me give him a super quick blow job, but no sex usually. And that makes me all the more horny. But he never messes around with me or anything. I feel like he looks down on me for being so weak/horny. 
 I have to beg and beg for him to have sex with me, but he will never give in until he wants it. And I can't deny him when he wants it, because I already want it so bad. He says all I care about in our relationship is sex, but it's not true. It just builds up inside and it's all I can think about. I feel like a horny man or something. Like other girls aren't like this. He says the devil is tempting me and I need to speak with God. I don't agree. 
 He will have a HUGE boner that I can feel whenever I'm trying to seduce him, but he will still say no to me! I don't get it. Why is it so hard for him to do? :/ 
 I also find that I masturbate way too much. It can be from at least 3 to 10 times a day. :( It doesn't even calm down my sex drive. At all. I just keep going and going. After sex though, I feel relieved and 'finished.' I can achieve an orgasm through masturbation, but I never feel finished, and can go right back to masturbating a minute later. I'm so embarrassed about it, and he doesn't even know I do it. He doesn't masturbate, (unless he somehow does it at work) because I am with him all the time at home. We shower together, sleep in the same bed, and everything. He will have a boner in the shower and won't let me anywhere near it. I just don't get it at all. 
 Am I pushing him? I feel like if genders were reversed here, it would be really bad. I just don't know how to calm myself down. What should I do??? 
 Other than our sex life, our relationship is amazing. He is everything I ever wanted, and I love him with all my heart. He makes me soooo happy, and I definitely do not want to end things with him over this. He doesn't want to get married until he has finished college and has a steady job. He wants to have a huge church wedding or something and be financially stable. That could be 4+ years before anything like that happens. 
 I've suggested no sex at all until then if it makes him uncomfortable and he said ""WHAT! No? I just mean we need to slow down. Not stop."" But he doesn't realize that I'm not getting anything. So if this all has to be slow ""until marriage"" is it going to get worse? How should I talk to him? It's very embarrassing to me, because I'm very shy, especially about sex. 
 So I don't know how to approach this. Especially when he gets all Christian on me. 
 Side note  - If it is my birth control that has driven me to being a nymphomaniac, it won't be another year until it is removed. But I'm not sure if it is the cause or not. If so does anyone know a way to counter it or decrease my sex drive?","I'm  extremely  horny and my boyfriend avoids sex with me, using Christianity as an excuse.",21,F,sex
"I posted this in another subreddit earlier, and I got some good advice.  However, it always pays to get more information, so I figured I would expand on the number of people I asked.  Here goes. 
 Alright folks, like the title says, I've come looking for some advice. I've browsed this subreddit for a few months, even made a few posts (on my main account). This is gonna be a long post, so bare with me for a bit. 
 I recently met a girl (we're both in our early 20's) through the r/R4R subreddit. By ""met"", I mean we messaged a few times, then transitioned to other forms of communication (skype, kik, facebook, text, etc.). Here's a little about us. 
 Her: She's pretty awesome. She's got a wicked sense of humour, and a sharp tongue to match. She's had some rough patches in the past, but I think she's overcome them and become a better person for it. She's also really pretty. If you want a shitty reference, I'd say she's at least a 9/10. Please don't slam the number system, I'm only using it so that people have some general idea of how attractive she is. 
 Me: I'm the kind of guy who loves joking around. I've got a pretty good sense of humour, basically. I've not had a particularly bad past, and I'm really a pretty relaxed guy. You could pull my pants down and expose me to a group of 50 girls and I wouldn't even be mad. I can say this because it's happened. I'm also the kind of guy who is aware of what can happen, is prepared for the worst, but hoping for the best. I'm not exactly the most handsome man in the world, but I don't exactly think I'm ugly. If you want an idea of what I look like, google Sean Lock and imagine what a younger version of him might look like. 
 Now, we've only been talking for a short period of time. She recently said she wants to come down and visit. She lives across the country in a different state. Naturally, I have some concerns regarding this, because as I said earlier in the post, ""I'm ... the kind of guy who is aware of what can happen, is prepared for the worst, but hoping for the best."" Here are my concerns: 
 
 Trust: We haven't talked for very long, like I said. So wanting to cross the country to visit so soon is a pretty significant level of trust no matter how you look at it. 
 
 Cost: Holy hell, this would cost a fair bit of money. Seems almost crazy to spend that on someone you've only talked to for a short period of time. 
 
 Match: I'll be blunt. She is way more attractive than me. If we were compared solely on looks, there's no way in hell I would deserve a girl like her (in my mind anyway). Perhaps she does find me attractive, or she just really likes who I am as a person, I'm not entirely sure yet. 
 
 
 I'm really good at looking at things objectively, but I also recognize that I stand at a biased point of view so I would like some advice. I think I would really enjoy being in a relationship with this girl. I know there is no guarantee anything will happen, and I know there are other things to be concerned about (such as cheating), because I still don't know her all that well. I also know that communication with her is crucial, so rest assured, I will be doing so. 
 What I ultimately want is a win/win, everybody is happy. How that happens doesn't really matter in the end, be it relationship, no relationship, visit, no visit. If that makes any sense. I know I won't be taking advantage of her, but I also don't want to be the fool who get's taken advantage of. 
 Now this all culminates into a few major question: Should I continue and try to make it work, or should I put a stop to it before it gets out of hand? How should I go about breaching these topics? Are there any other things I should ask/talk about?","Met a girl online recently, she seems pretty awesome. She wants to visit, but she lives far away so if anything happens it would be a long distance thing. Should I or shouldn't I?

 All Aboard! 
 The cab ride to the airport was hell. Taking a cab in Venezuela is equivalent to taking a gamble on your life.  I'd rather play Russian roulette with Christopher Walken than take another cab ride in Venezuela.  At least then your chances are 1 in 6 instead of the 50/50 that I felt for about 2 hours going from Merida to Caracas. 
 One north-bound lane and one south are all that exist road-wise from those two locations and they happen to be poorly paved, full of pot-holes, and oh yeah... they tend to wrap around cliff sides.  ""We're going too slow in this lane?"" thinks my cabby?  Why don't we veer in to oncoming traffic and then take the shoulder of the cliff to pass the guy who's only going 80.  I still have marks in my arm from where my friend Tracy sat next to me digging in with her nails at every erratic maneuver. 
 I would have asked him to be more careful, and indeed I tried, but the only words he knew in English we're ""It's okay!"" and ""You're super safe!"" The only super thing I recall is super clenching my butthole multiple times. 
 We ultimately arrived safely at the airport though; and way ahead of schedule too. However, anybody who has traveled by air in a country whose airport is basically a renovated military installation will tell you that this is not a blessing.  ""Expect delays,"" we're told as we reach the counter.  No big deal, I've got my discman (it was 2003 okay?) so as long as I can jam I'm set.  All we have to do is go through security and... security thinks my discman is a bomb. Seriously.  I had a bunch of cables as I was big in to audio at that point so when they x-rayed my bag and saw about 6 different cables going every which way, they naturally concluded that the 18 year old has a bomb.  Either that or it was a shakedown.  My 18 year old self concluded that the yelling man with the gun had all the authority he needed and my discman was confiscated.  (Miss you discbro!) 
 So this day could be going better but whatever.  I've been doing mudslide relief for the past 2 weeks and I'm too exhausted to care. So we sit at our gate for 3 hours in an environment that distinctly lacks AC and suddenly we hear over the intercom that our flight has been moved... to the other side of the airport. 
 We collectively groaned our disapproval before sacking up for the hike.  The girls in our group collectively complained about being too tired, and because guys are suckers, we hauled their luggage for them.  We finish our trek and I'm delighted to find that the concession shop in front of our new gate has the biggest Toblerone I've ever seen.  I'm talking Lebron James ego size Toblerone..  Naturally I had to have it, and purchasing it made me feel strangely better about the loss of my discman. 
 After about another hour of delays (our plane is broken is the assumption and they are applying the correct amount of duct tape) the plane get's taxied to the gate.  I stand there looking at this beastly large plane and something just seems off to me, but I'm too tired to question my instinct and we all hand over our tickets and hop on board.  Entering the plane causes another flag, as the rows are quite wide and all of the seats are large and plushy, not just first class.  Granted this was a trans-continental flight, but only going from Venezuela to Florida.  It would take longer to fly from Iowa to Denver.  Still, I can't muster the energy to care and I'm too enthralled with my new leather sitting place to care. 
 Well they start to pressurize the cabin when suddenly a small Latino man runs on to the plane and says something quickly in Spanish.  Calmly a number of people around us get up wordlessly, grab their carry-on luggage and start to exit the plane.  Now, I am one of the few people that speaks any Spanish in our group and the one other one wasn't paying attention so suddenly 9 individual heads all swivel toward me but I honestly hadn't understood he spoke so fast.  I asked one of the departing passengers to repeat what the man had said and seeing a bunch of gringos eagerly staring at him he took mercy and spoke slowly.  Even still, it was hard to understand, and my compatriot still did not quite get what the new messenger said... but it was amazing.  This is what I understood from what that stranger said: 
 Plane... going to... Holland. 
 Once I fully comprehended the puzzle pieces of the fragments I understood the natural panic took over me for a brief second before I looked down at the giant Toblerone in my hands.  ""What if we did just randomly go to Holland?"" I thought to myself. What if I just said, ""Everything's fine guys! Sit back and relax!"" 
 The serene comfort of a first class leather seat on an air conditioned cabin.  The peculiar excitement of setting off for the wrong destination and the chaos that would ensue as a result.  The abject fear of having to call my mother who was already terrified of me traveling to Venezuela in the first place.  All of these thoughts and emotions swirled in my head, preventing me from immediately coming to any rational decision. 
 However, before my scales had truly tipped my mouth made up my mind for me and I shouted ""everybody off!"" At first I was met with more groaning but they quickly changed their tune when I gave the reason why.  I still sometimes wonder what would have happened if we'd just gone to Holland that day, but at least on the flight we did take we got watch ""Mi Perro Skip.""","1,000 words on the dot",18,M,cigars

"So I'm an 18 year old guy in England, and I'm in my first year of university. I'm settled in happily and I've made good friends, but there is this one friend that I really care about and I don't know how to tell her. 
 I guess a timeline would help a bit. My house has 7 of us in, including both me and her. She is polish but has lived in England for 5 years before coming to university. We started university in late September, and I developed a crush on her. She was really friendly to me, but seemed a bit nervous around me at the same time. Around half way into October, me and her went on a night out with two other housemates, and me and her ending up spending most the night kissing. She invited me into her room later that night, and we continued kissing, but it didn't go any further and we went out separate ways. 
 The next day she sat me down and told me that she hadn't had a boyfriend for 4 years, and even then, it never lasted more than a week. She then told me that the night before wasn't a mistake, but it shouldn't have happened. The weekend after she went out and found a polish guy, who a few days later she kissed. He wasn't interested though really, and he messed her about and led her on for a week or two (he wouldn't turn up to meet her, badmouthed her infront of his mates, was very pushy with her when she didn't want to). They then broke off with one another, and she opened up about it all to me. 
 Since then she hasn't seen anyone else in that way, but we don't talk as much as we used to because it seems somewhat awkward. If we're in a group, then she will talk to me more, but one on one it becomes small talk (as we're both shy people). She was bad with managing her money last semester and I lent her around £150 which she repaid yesterday. 
 I've liked her a lot ever since I met her. I care about her so much, and I just want to know how she feels. I just don't know how to tell her without coming across too strong, and as we rarely speak 1 on 1, then what do I say? There's the added complication of if it doesn't go the way I want it to, then because we're housemates then I'll see her every day still. 
 I'll be honest and say I wrote this after watching 'Perks of being a Wallflower' and I could relate to a scene in it. My housemate has asked me before about what I want from the girl, and I responded 'I just want her to be happy'. This happened in the film, and they told the guy that he can't live his life putting others before yourself, and that if you want something you should try get it. 
 Any ideas?","Really like a girl who is my housemate at university, we've kissed before, but I can't stop thinking about her still.",18,M,relationship_advice

 Backstory: I smoked alot of pot, and when i mean alot i mean that all i did. One day i smoked some weed and BAM SHIT>FAN. never been right since then. But when i think about it, i had these ""feelings"" even when i was very young but never thought anything of it. 
 I am an overthinker, i stress over shit way the fuck too much. I understand that but thanks for telling! What can i do? i want an answer. I am in the middle of looking for a better job (i have a college degree), but am so fucking nervous that i will BE nervous that its controlling my life. 
 If my heart rate gets up at all i freak out. I stop skateboarding, smoking, exercising because i couldn't handle it. to top it off i have a fast metabolism that i eventually turned into if im hungry, i panick!

"Ok so this didn't happen today but happened a few years ago! At the time of the the fuck up I was about 13 or 14 years old! 
 This happened durning the school holidays. And I was stuck at home while my parents were at work. On that day my gran was at the house with me and as with most 13 year olds I got bored of being stuck in the house and decided to go outside and find something to occupy my tiny mind. Being a boy at that age I loved playing with fire and setting things on fire. So I had a magnifying glass and was burning holes into leaves and setting small pieces of paper alight. That soon become unsatisfactory to the arsonist inside me and wanted bigger flames. This is where things start becoming a fuck up. So I sit for a while and think how can I get bigger fires going and then a little light bulb went on. Why not take an aerosol tin of deodorant and a lighter and make a flames by spraying the aerosol onto the open flame. I run inside get my deodorant and take a lighter from the kitchen all while my gran was sleeping in the chair. I go outside and do a few bursts of flames and with the can of spray and lighter and thought it was great. Once again I got bored of it and wanted to up the excitement some more. I wonder around the garden and see and old tree, this tree was semi dead at the time and it was a sort of palm tree. So this tree was standing about 1,5m from the house so it was pretty close and was just taller than the house, if I had to guess the height I'd say about 3,5m or more. The thing about this tree is that it had weird little wooden stick things that stuck out of it. And I thought hmm that will be fun to burn. I proceed to douse one of the little wooden spikes with the deodorant, what I didn't realize about the tree was that it had like this fine ""hair"" ( like the hair you find on the outside of a coconut) around the trunk that ran all the way up the tree and in the process of covering the stick with the deodorant I got some on this highly flammable hair. Here's where the story heats up ( pun intended ) I set the little stick on fire and of course the flame carries to this hair around the tree and next thing I knew the fire was all the way at the top of the tree. It had climbed the tree so quickly I didn't realize what happened until I saw the smoke. Immediately a wave of panic hits me, what if the fire spreads to the house cause we have wooden fascia boards and if that catches on fire the house will be toast. Luckily the tree was still alive at the top and went leaves weren't really catching on fire but the truck was burning up quickly. So I run around the corner to fetch the hose pipe as I run around the corner with it I realize it's not going to be long enough to reach the tree and I drop it and think of another way. I run into the house with the tree still burning and get out one of my moms big Tupperware bowls and run back to the tree, all while my gran is still fast asleep. By this point the smoke is now rising quickly so I run to the pool and fill the bucket with water run back to the tree and threw the water at the flames, I repeated this action about 3 or 4 times until the fire was out. Once the fire was out I took damage control, I looked around and the house was fine but the tree was black around the back and if it wasn't dead then it would be now. Thinking I got away with this without any serious trouble I went back into the house and watched some tv. Later that evening my dad came home and I was in my room when I heard him at the front door talking to the next door neighbour. Few minutes later he came into my room to question me. Apparently the next door neighbour saw the smoke in the back yard and asked my dad if everything was fine. I came clean to the crime and showed my dad the tree. I got grounded for a month and the next day and for the rest of the week I had to go to work with my dad. Keep in mind that my dad works at a bank. If I was bored before, I was definitely bored then! 
 The tree was removed a few years later removed because I ended up killing it!","stupid 13 year old me, with access to flammable deodorant and a lighter set a tree on fire that was next to the house. Got grounded",13,M,tifu
"Hi AskWomen! 
 I hope this is the right subreddit--/r/fancyfollicles and /r/femalefashionadvice didn't quite seem to fit the bill. 
 I posted a few days ago in FFA about my work wardrobe--it's a new goal of mine to make over my work appearance. I work in a business casual and formal environment, and most of my clients are doctors, bankers, lawyers, CEO's, politicians, etc. You know the type--rich old American white males. I'm young--in my early twenties, and the youngest person in my workplace by about 10 years, and younger than most of our customers by at least thirty. On FFA's recommendation I ordered a few items to help me look a little more put-together and mature so that I am taken more seriously at work. 
 I'm excited for my new clothes and shoes, and that has left me some time to ponder my other attributes--mainly my makeup and hair. I'm proficient at makeup (holla at my girls over at /r/makeupaddiction) and sadly think I'll have to dial it down a little (good-bye, purple lips!) but I feel okay there. 
 What I'm worried about is my hair. My hair is long--when straight and down, it comes to my asscrack--and brunette. I wear it up in a ponytail or a bun most often, to keep it out of my face at work, but I worry that my ponytails are making me look like a college student. When I walk into events, I get looks like I'm a lost girlfriend of a younger associate, not the manager who organized the entire seminar. 
 I've noticed none of the women members we cater to have long hair, and I've even read a few articles condeming long hair.

"Pictures of my face]( 
 Hi, I'm a 21 yr. old male who has had acne since I was in 7th grade. Recently it’s been clearing up with some whiteheads popping up now and then, but now I’m left with a massive amount of scars. From reading the wiki/FAQ, I believe what I have is a combination of  PIH  (post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation) and  atrophic scarring . Please correct me if I’m wrong. 
 &nbsp; 
 Skin type: Very oily. 
 &nbsp; 
 Routine: 
Every day, in the morning, I wash my face with Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser. Before I shower at night, I use a clean, wet face towel to gently rid my skin of dirt and oil (this really helped me get rid of whiteheads). In the shower I use St. Ives Blemish Control Apricot Scrub, then Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser. I sleep with a clean pillowcase every night. 
Every three days I use  Banish's Pumpkin Enzyme Mask  for my scars. I use the medium-sized roller. After doing the [roller treatment]( I apply their vitamin C serum. I’ve been using it for around two months, but haven’t seen significant results. 
 &nbsp; 
 What can I change about my routine to see less redness and/or more smoothness in my skin? What can I do about my whiteheads? I’ve never seen a doctor/dermatologist; should I see one? 
 &nbsp; 
 Sorry for the long post, I just want to have clear skin for once in my life. I feel like I’ve tried everything and it has really worn down my self-esteem. Thank you so much for replying! :)

"To start off, I'm 18, F, lesbian (it becomes relevant). I've just graduated high school in a town I've lived in for 10 years, and I'm a little sad about the state of my life right now. 
 Basically I feel as if my entire world here has cut me off for some reason. About a week ago, I was looking through some photos from the final high school band concert. There was a picture of all the seniors with our conductor, and I realized I'm not in it. No one even told me about it. I'd like to think it was just a mistake. I've had some debate with my conductor before, some of it kind of serious. We're generally civil to one another, but I'm pretty sure he's happy to be rid of me. This might be relevant, I don't even know. 
 Despite living here for ten years, I was a really, really quiet and awkward child, so I only have two close friends that I made in high school (one F17, one M19). I'm terrified at the fact that we will probably never speak to each other again. We're usually a ""tri-force of debauchery"" (I love that we refer to ourselves as such), but we all seem to hate each other at the moment. 
 Here's why: I know M19 friend and I simply tolerate the F17 friend. Honestly I don't like her behavior a lot, but we don't have major issues. Sometimes she just needs to excersize self control. As for the M19 friend, he's a little bit ignorant to the way real life works. He went to Christian school, and made no effort of rebellion (really, I'm not an asshat atheist. I just see that Christian school and public school are very different, and my friend is a human example). Its somewhat endearing, but at times frustrating. 
 He once asked me 'how do gay people work'? This was funny, but in normal conversation, there are remarks about how I'm 'not really a girl anyway', and touching me a lot is 'okay, because it's not like you like it', etc. etc. Yeah, that sounds kind of creepy. More than I previously realized. To make matters worse, when we were closer/younger, people would joke about us being madly in love. (Background: M19 and I are talented. We were put in the highest ranking band as freshman, and when this happens, older members like to bust your chops.) I found it amusing, and he'd generally get angry or defensive about it. I don't understand this, either. I've asked him about it out of sheer curiosity, literally three years later, there are more questions than answers. Sort of. I don't think about it much. 
 Despite flaws, I like these people a lot. I don't want to leave without spending some time with them. To accomplish such, I have phone numbers, but they've both blocked my facebook. I know that M19 has because his girlfriend doesn't like me (it still seems weird). The reasoning he gave me is that she is uncomfortable with us spending a lot of time together, likely because she's away at college. Though, she has no reason to suspect anything. He could never cheat. He can't lie to save his life. Besides, I'm gay, and she knows that. As for the F17 friend, I don't know why she blocked me, but I'm less distraught over that one. 
 As a result of these things, I opted out of attending graduation and had my diploma mailed to me. Nobody asked or cared to know why I didn't show, except for my band conductor, because he needed to remind me that I owe money for a charter bus fee. 
 I don't understand any of what's going on. Perhaps I'm socially inept, or I've offended everyone to some great degree. I'm not overwhelmingly rude. I say some ""colorful?"" things from time to time, and people call me witty for it. If everyone has such a problem with me, you'd think somebody would at least tell me I'm an offensive sack of shit. 
 I'm moving to San Francisco in less than 3 months, and I'm going to be completely alone. It isn't something I fear necessarily, because Bay Area people are friendly and I'm from there anyway, but I'm leaving literally everything behind, and I don't really want to. The people, that is, at least my two friends that seem to give zero fucks. I might just be overreacting, as my facebook is riddled with graduation photos of classmates I don't even know. I know its just high school and in the grand scheme of things, unimportant, but I'm still incredibly depressed right now.","I'm moving in 3 months from my ""home"" of 10 years, nobody gives a fuck, even my two closest friends.

"21/F college girl living off-campus, at home with my family. 
 Quick background: I was born & raised overseas and moved here when I was 9. I quickly picked up English but was living in an abusive home til my mom divorced my dad when I was 13 and we moved out. I gained more freedom and tried to participate in more school activities and make friends, but always found it hard. Up until I was 13, I wasn't allowed to interact with boys and was scared to death because of my dad's threats. I also was rarely allowed to have friends over. My dad was also racist and my best friend was half-black so she could never come over... 
 Anyway when we moved out I thought things would get better, but I never really made any friends. I'm still relatively close to my best friend but she was really the only one I had throughout high school and during my first year of college. She moved to a different city so I never get to see her anymore. During my first year of university, I attended the orientation week events which are meant to bring people together, but all the people I met were a) also living off-campus and b) part of the faculty I got accepted to, but I switched faculties in 2nd year. For the first 2 years, I spent a lot of time with those friends I met in 1st year. We had our own little group and it was fun! 
 Eventually, especially in 3rd year, we just stopped hanging out as much... Now, I haven't seen any of them since October. And when we do see each other, it's really awkward. I feel out of place, because each one of them has made OTHER friends throughout the years except for me and we never had much in common to begin with. 
 This year has been especially hard for me. I am 100% alone on campus. I run into people I ""know"" from class or work or that I briefly met sometime in my 4 years here, but that's about it. It's the most frustrating thing because I have become extremely self-conscious about my lack of friends and social life and very paranoid. I feel like people look at me as ""the weird girl with no friends"" or something. I know it sounds dumb, but it's truly how I feel walking around campus every day. 
 I know I'm not the only one, but it sure feels like it. And I have joined at least 3+ clubs every year and made sure to attend the events when I could, but even that was fruitless. I would go to the events, talk to some people, and then never see them again because they'd either never show up or the club would only hold like 2 events per year. 
 I also started volunteering at the school radio station and met some people there. I really thought I would make friends there, but that has actually been my most disheartening experience. I absolutely LOVE working there because of my love of all things music and radio, but the people I'm with don't make me feel very comfortable. I've actually hung out with a few of them on many occasions, but each time it was either awkward or forced. Over the holidays, it was the most comfortable I felt but then I realized that the people I was becoming friends didn't want to be friends... Two of the guys there flirted with me every time we saw each other, knowing I am in a committed relationship. 
 It's just really depressing. There are so many events in my city and at school that I want to go to, but I have no one to go with. Not even my boyfriend, who lives an hour away, can really go to those things with me because I can only see him on the weekends and he doesn't feel comfortable going to those radio events with me knowing what I've told him about those two guys (who are always there!) 
 Oh, and another thing is that it's almost like my loneliness has become a running joke between everyone. They always invite me to concerts and events and when I show up alone, it's really awkward. People have come to expect me to show up alone, but when I try to 'join in' it doesn't work... Those guys just hang out amongst themselves, trying to pick up chicks so it feels like the only way I could ever hang out with them is if I'm hooking up with one of them. 
 When I take a step back and think about my college experience, I realize that I have met no one I can call a true friend. The people who have approached me or wanted to hang out with me all ended up being guys interested in something more. I did meet a girl in 2nd year in class and we clicked so much, but then she moved away... I feel like now that I am 21, it's just hopeless and only downhill from here...","I've been in college for 4 years and have made no friends. if anything, it's gotten worse over the years and it feels like it's only gonna get worse once I graduate next year.

"Im currently 16 and in my sophomore year of high school. I recently moved to this school in late january.  In my math class theres a girl that sits behind me diagnally. For probably the first two weeks I was in that class I didnt exist. I was the quiet new kid. Then I started to raise my hand and answer the questions that no one else would. I swear they thought I was Albert Einstein its not that hard its only geometry.  Then I was known as the smart new kid. After that spring break came. Idid my usual thing which is go surf with my friends that live up in San clemente.  When I came back my math teacher asked if people went to the movies. People raised their hands. Did anyone just sleep? People raised their hands. Did anyone go surfing over the break? I was the only person who raised their hand which didn't surprise me because I live in a town that isnt close to the beach not far but not close I still go surf every weekend though. Right after I put my hand down the girl I metioned earlier alarmingly ask if I surfed. I thought It was a stupid question since I just raised my hand answer that to the whole class but I politely said yes. How many years have you been surfing!?!? 5 I said nervously (I get nervous around pretty girls. I can typically keep it under control but I slip up here and there.)Wow you must be good then. Huh? Sure  im alright l say in a 
Less nervous voice. She begins to talk about how she lives in near the beach with her dad who surfs alot. Every day since then she has tried to start conversations about surfing with me in the brief minutes before class starts. When every we are in our assigned groups she again always talks to me. Today once again she makes a comment about how the waves have been I told it was actually really fun this weakend. She said her dad had a good time too. I was about say I caught one best waves I could in a while but was cut off by the start of class. We take notes about some lame circle triangle thing then get paired in to groups of 2. Im paired with a girl that sits to my right. I surfer chick is paired with the guy behind me. Doing my work I here surfer chick say somthing like she bought a new bikini bottom and shirt over thw weekend. I do my work I thought it was strange that the guy she was partnered didnt say anything. Then I hear her tell the guy ""i guess Riles doent care but Im gonna tell him anyway"". I act dumb and say ""huh what's going on?"" Pretending all I heard was my name. She looks at the guy behind me back at me and says ""oh I was just saying how I a new shirt"" she points to a plain black t shirt with the words ""bird rock"" (this is a surf I spot that ive told ive been to but dont frequent) printed on it. I say ""thats cool"" in an cheerful voice that kind of sounded fake. Class went on period ended she said bye I said bye and went my next class. So do you think she's interested in me? And if so what do I do?  She's really nice to everyone she talks to (tells the girl that I sit next who is kind of um wide... that she has nice and such) and I thinks she pretty im just not good with girls or iust new people In general.

"I was 25 at the time and had divorced a few months prior. After my divorce I went into full manwhore mode. I'm a decent looking dude, 6'1"", 205#, dirty blonde hair, blue eyes, I'm no gym rat but I have a job that keeps me active all day and in good shape. 
 I'm 3rd wheeling it at a bar with my friend and his GF. We are getting shitty drunk (an every night thing for me at the time) and his GF says ""I think my friend is coming to hang out with us."" Cool, the more the merrier. 
 About 20 minutes later her friend shows up. We will call her T, for the sake of anonymity. T is about 5""2 in heels, 100#, fiery green eyes, and a strawberry blonde. She was a solid 8.5 on a 10 scale when sober. In my condition she looked like an eleventeen. 
 She orders up a vodka and red bull, and I exchange my empty beer for a fresh one. All 4 of us are chatting and laughing. And I noticed she touched my arm when she laughed...always a good sign. By the end of that round my friend and his GF wanted to shoot some pool. They get up to go grab a rack of balls and pick out some cues. 
 As they left the table she leaned over, put her hand in my crotch and started rubbing my  dick. She looks me in the eyes and smirks. ""Follow me"". Being the gentleman I am I oblige without question. She grabs her purse and leads me to the women's bathroom. 
 Well by this time the fuckstick is at full mast and we go into the handicap stall. I close the door and lock it and she sits down on the toilet. I walk over and she unbuckles my belt, unbuttons my jeans, pulls down my boxers and starts giving me some violent head. 
 She is deep throating and gagging. Spitting on my dick and jerking with the fervor of a porn starlet. She has my undivided attention. 
 She pulls my member out of her mouth and asks if I have a condom as she continues stroking my crank. FUCK! ""Nope, but I can go get one."" She reaches for her purse sitting on the railing and fishes one out. Perfect! 
 She hikes up her dress and pulls off her lacy little black thong to reveal a beautiful slick shaven pussy with a finger-width landing strip. She throws the soaked panties in her purse. She stands up, turns around and has one foot on the floor and her knee on the toilet seat. 
 There, in all of its glistening glory, was my perfectly presented prize. I push myself into her and she starts cooing. I'm in awe that I'm full on fucking some woman that I've known for the course of a beer...fuck it. Trim is trim, and I'm in. 
 I'm balls deep in T and rage fucking this girl. Balls slapping clit, she's moaning, and the rougher I get the more she soaks my rod and wails. She's a screamer. I give zero fucks at this moment. I hear the bathroom door opening and closing, toilets flushing, hand dryers cycling on and off...it doesn't phase me one bit. At times I hear women's voices...not T's and some are whispering, some laughing...I don't pay attention or acknowledge their words. I am completely zoned in on fucking the living shit out of T. 
 It could have been two minutes since we began, it could have been an hour. Time was lost to me at this point and in my condition. She's moaning and screaming to god...there is no god here, only a sexually explosive man in the throes of a post divorce, self serving, fuckstravaganza. 
 She lunges forward as I feel myself crashing into her cervix...she is trembling and shaking and tells me she wants me to come in her mouth. ""Turn around"". I rip off the condom dripping with her juices and shove my lube and precum covered dick into her mouth. She starts bobbing her head and fiddling with my balls...wham! I come like the fury of  1000 badgers spun out on crank, deep in her throat. She half chokes, half coughs, and the next wave of semen comes pouring from my member into her mouth. 
 She continues to stroke me and squeeze my throbbing dick and coax every last drop from me. ""Fuck yes!  Let's get a drink and go shoot some pool!"" She said through smiling lips, my once erect member shrinking in her hand. 
 I pull up my boxers and my jeans as she takes a quick piss. She dries off and stands up. ""I'm not putting my panties back on, they're soaked and I would just have to take them off again when we get home in a while."" 
 I wash my hands and as we exit the women's bathroom. There stands my buddy with a full on shit-eating grin, his girlfriend, and half a bar-full of strangers. My buddy hi-fives me and everyone is laughing cheering and clapping. I exclaim ""who needs a beer? I need a smoke!"" T was smiling and laughing, she wasn't embarrassed in the least. 
 We stayed at that bar until closing. I got my tab for the night and it was only 12 bucks. The bartender said that a bunch of people were paying for my beers all night. And that I better not pull that shit again in his place. Fair enough. 
 T and I were fuck buddies for a while but that all ended when she caught up to me at the same bar and I was with another woman. She got pissed and dramatic, and went completely left when I reminded her that told her I didn't want anything exclusive.",Banged a screamer in a bar bathroom stall while the patrons listened in.,25,M,AskReddit

 I won't try to drag out my backstory - I guess this post is my testimony. I was introduced to porn at the age of seven. I was living abroad in Europe, and my brother and I would watch porn on TV. I was so young, but I can't imagine the damage I was doing to my young mind. I never got off to it, but I still remember those images to this day. 
 Fast forward to a young Emelcee3 filled with teenage angst and hormones and I rediscovered porn at the age of 12. Like many of you, I was addicted, masturbating at least once on the daily for 10 years. I never realized that porn was a problem for me, until when I was nearing the end of 2014, I experienced ED with a one-night-stand prospect,  twice . It was awful, and it absolutely wrecked my confidence. Now I've always prided myself in being a people person, but this instance of sexual failure really messed with me. I remember yelling, ""GOD DAMN IT PENIS, WHAT THE SHIT."" 
 Fast forward to February where I discovered Nofap through an askreddit thread about something or other. I came to the conclusion that this is what I needed in my life, but at this stage in nofap I was doing it only for what I determined was PIED. After the initial discovery of ""superpowers"" (placebo or not), I saw the light, as many of you have, and decided that nofap was for me. I was not able to hit a streak of over 20 days until that fateful month that ended with me making one utterly vile smore with my life essence. 
 Fast forward once again to today. I achieved my longest streak of 90 days, experiencing wet dreams occasionally and having sexy time with a classy broad over a one-night-stand. Towards the end I was feeling exceptionally horny, and I was starting to question why I was even doing nofap. I remember seeing a post that encouraged a user to fap to  really  rediscover why they were doing nofap. I don't recommend this method to everyone, but as I sit here typing this, I am reminded why I am doing nofap in the first place. 
 Here's just a few major points from my 11 months of nofap trials. I don't want to rehash what others have said, but I do want to stress these points. 
 
 Despite the relapse, I am damn proud of my streak.  I am more motivated than ever to continue on and hit a streak double of what I have already achieved. Just because your relapse doesn't mean it's a complete failure and restart. Be proud of what you've achieved. No one is perfect. 
 
 If it weren't for that post on the askreddit thread plugging nofap, I would have never discovered nofap  I'm not saying I would not have discovered it at some other time, but my point is that you never know when plugging this amazing community may help someone struggling with depression and porn. Don't go overboard and come across annoying like an overly zealous preacher, but don't be ashamed to help others discover nofap. 
 
 While my original nofap motives were soloey for my issues with sex, I have discovered that I want to do nofap to be a better person.  Shortly after starting nofap, I made it a point to go to the gym 3-5 times a week. If you are struggling with boredom, depression, and/ or anxiety,  I cannot stress enough how wonderful physical activities such as lifting, hiking, running, etc. will be for your mental health, as well as your physique.  The gym has become therapy for me, and this is coming from someone who has dealt with true depression and anxiety.  Nofap is NOT the miracle problem solver for all of your damn issues, but it can be a wonderful foundation to improve yourself. 
 
 This is sort of off-topic, but a huge help in me going through life has been reading  How to Win Friends and Influence People  by Dale Carnegie.  This book has helped teach me to be more selfless, learn not to criticize people, and see things from other people's point of view. It is astounding how helpful this has been in my interactions with friends, classmates, coworkers, and family. Go read it.

"Hi, I’m looking for some advice. Sorry for the length. Thanks for considering my issues. 
 For nearly a decade, I was friends with a lovely, amazing woman. We were neighbors, met at our high school bus stop, and bonded quickly over our shared interests. We are two VERY different people, and have certainly had our spats over the years, but I fear my anxiety/paranoia may have finally wrecked our relationship for good. 
 About me: Graduted uni last spring. Moved out of state with my long-term boyfriend [23M], who I’m currently living with. I am no longer seeing or speaking to my father; he’s a liar and manipulator. My relationship with my mom is less bad, but not great. Frankly, she scares the shit out of me. She’s on a hair trigger and tends to shout and insult and belittle me if I set her off, then act as if she did nothing wrong. My parents are divorced, but live within 25 minutes of each other. 
 About her: Still going to college, living at home with her parents, siblings, and niece. No driver license or job. She has a poor relationship with her family, and at the time of this issue, a very rocky relationship with her boyfriend. She deals with depression and anxiety, and has very little self-esteem. 
 I don’t want to spill her personal issues, so I’ll speak about it generally. Back in October, my friend ran into heaps of trouble and really, really needed support and kindness and love from those around her. With her home and romantic relationships on the rocks, and me living several hours way, I did my best to keep in contact with her and assuage her worries. 
 Coincidentally, my mom asked me to visit home and pet sit for 10 days while she, my stepdad, and sister went on vacation. No problem, I’ve done this for them every year since I was 16. And lucky for me and my friend, I would be there to support her in her time of need! 
 Unfortunately, I severely underestimated the toll of being back home. I arrived two days early (which was asked of me), which meant 48+ hours of terror and anxiety. I was doing my best to stay out of the way and out of trouble. By this time, I had also cut contact with my father, including changing my number. However, I was afraid of running into him around town. When going to the grocery store, movies, or anywhere, I was paranoid that he would spot me and show up at my mom’s house — which he has done before. 
 It turns out that it is easier to make promises about being there for someone when you are safe at home and in your comfort zone! Surprise! Within days of coming home, I was having trouble sleeping and having awful nightmares when I could. The combined pressure of my mom and dad really weakened my emotional strength. I could feel symptoms of my depression returning (which I hadn’t suffered from since high school — the last time I lived with my parents). The entire house and even the town felt toxic. On top of this, I could barely keep in contact with my boyfriend (busy with work/hobbies). He has been my rock when dealing with my parents. 
 So, things started out OK but quickly faltered. We spent lots of time together, talking and taking walks and going out to movies and dinner and working on crafts. Then, she said something very cruel, meant as a joke, but I didn’t take it that way. I am a very private person, and only me and two other people know why what she said would have hurt me, and I wasn’t comfortable enough to explain why. I didn’t say anything, but it definitely contributed to my nightmares. 
 By midweek, I was really suffering. I am a person who needs space to recharge and I like to prep myself for extended periods of interaction. My friend, however, was staying with me every day, for 6+ hours at a time, often into the wee hours of the morning. I couldn't talk to her about my feelings -- her's were center stage (rightfully so), and also couldn't convince her to give me a bit of space without her getting upset and teary. She doesn't really have other friends, or a way to travel to them, and her boyfriend wasn't really talking to her at the time, so she had no one to look to for support but me. 
 When I couldn't take it any more (combination of no space + growing paranoia from going out on the town so often), I ended up locking myself up for almost two days, barely saying a thing to anyone. No one, including my friend, could get ahold of me, and she didn’t take it very well. She was upset, and I don't blame her. Finally it came down to her deleting her FB (our primary means of communication, at least when we were talking long-distance), and writing a very aggressive and mean post on her blog about me. I couldn’t get a hold of her for a days, and at that time I didn’t even want to. When she finally came back, she started sending me messages apologizing for “whatever she did” and asked if I was done ignoring her. I responded meanly. I said she had overreacted, and that writing that blog post was mean. She is the type to internalize other’s feelings as hatred of herself, and I told her that “[My mood/mindset] was never about [her] in the first place.” 
 In turn, she wrote me an essay. An angry essay. She complained that we didn’t “do anything” that I had promised, and what we had done was subpar (including me driving her around, taking her out for dinner and movies, and otherwise giving her opportunities she wouldn’t have without someone driving her), and making all my feelings about herself. I said I was burnt out, so she thought it was because of her that I felt that way. I was feeling depressed, so she thought it was something she had done. I seemed distant, so she thought it was because she was aggravating me with her friendship. She never pauses to ask what the actual issues are — just jumps to horrible assumptions. 
 She also got really short about my relationship with my boyfriend, apologizing (sarcastically) because she couldn't be as good as him. She also said that I shouldn’t need to talk to him every day because we live together. She essentially called me a codependent, sniveling asshole. The essay then discussed how she needed me, desperately, and I understand. I feel awful for being unable to be there for her. I wish I had had the emotional fortitude to provide her with the support she needed. 
 I ended up not answering. I had no idea what to say. She was pissed, and I think she might have deleted her FB again temporarily. Then, in November, we had this exchange (I was back home then): 
 Her: “-issue was successfully resolved,- by the way. just on the off chance that you actually cared.” 
 Me: “nearly two weeks and all you send is the most scathingly passive-aggressive, guilt-trippy message possible. I’m very happy that everything went well for you.” 
 Her: “You could have reached out to me in that time, too, you know. I don’t know why it always has to be up to me to try and mend things when we fight.” 
 Me: “I needed time to put my head back on my shoulders. It wasn’t my intention to fight with you. I wanted time to handle my insecurities, fears, and feelings — while -at mom’s house- and back at home.” 
 She never responded, so about 24 hours later I sent: 
 Me: “If you want to talk, we can. But no pressure.” 
 Then I realized that she had just unfriended me instead. It’s been two months now, and I don’t know if I am a giant jerkwad asshole or not. Maybe this silence is justified, and the relationship is rightfully over for good. We do have a lot in common, even if we are very different. A fight of his magnitude has never happened before. But honestly she needed support. I don’t deny that at all. I wasn’t emotionally equipped to help her. 
 I guess the issue is — can we recover from this? Is it better that we went our separate ways? Should I reach out to her? I miss her, and I do want to talk to her and see how she’s doing. But I’m not totally convinced that it is my place to seek contact when she has cut it off so many times.","Had a fight with a friend, haven’t really spoken in two months. She’s blocked or unfriended me on all social media. Unsure if it’s appropriate to reach out to her.",23,F,relationships
"You'd be surprised how little a kid costs.  If you do things intelligently, you can finance a child for less than 100 a month man, and you can still get them toys and things as long as you have a job that pays decently, and live in a place that you can afford with your job.

 Being frugal (not cheap), and managing your expenditures can really go so far.  Cook your own damn food, don't spend huge amounts on frivolous shit like new clothes all the time, or every new AAA video game when it comes out.  Only buy discounted stuff.  Full price is well above a profit margin, and you can get really crazy cheap food and things on sales and clearances.

"As is the usual with these posts, this FU didn't happen today, but when I was 7-8 years old. 
 Some backstory as to what a ""rock"" dog is: 
 When I was a child I really really wanted a dog, but my mom couldn't be bother with taking care of it as I lived with my father full time and we weren't allowed to have one in his flat, so one day I was walking on the beach with my mom and grandmother, and was again begging her to get me a dog, when my grandmother had the brilliant idea of giving me a rock dog. 
 A rock dog is basically a rock with a hole in it, with some string through the hole, so as to have the possibility to walk the ""dog"". 
 And all is great with my new dog, I go on walks and have fun, and my mom doesn't need to bother with taking care of an actual dog, until the day of the FU. 
 My mom is outside hanging up some laundry and I want to play some football with her (soccer for you Americans) but she is busy with the laundry, so of course I kept upset and my rock dog comes to the rescue. 
 Yes, he viciously attacked my mother in the face, and by him I of course mean I grabbed the ""leash"" and threw the rock at her face in a temper tantrum. 
 This of course resulted in me getting a proper smack up the head, as deserved, and my dog being put down. She threw him in the trash and grounded me from using the computer when I was at her place for almost 1 month.",My dog viciously attacked my mother on my command and got put down because of it.,13,M,tifu
"A buddy of mine call him Kevin is in a very sticky situation and he has no idea the legal grounds to money he is entitled to. 
 My buddies dad is very old and has many kids from different wives. So my buddy has many half siblings. They all used to get along well and there were no issues growing up. One of Kevin's oldest half sisters Jackie, passed away with cancer when he was 16. She didn't have kids so she left each member of their family some money. For Kevin she left ~50k so that he would not have to pay for school and it was meant for him.
Since he was younger than 19, his oldest sibling their half sister Martha was given all the money to hold. In order to receive student loans and grants, the money was to be held and just monthly student loan payments were to be made. This would ensure the loan organization not cutting up funding for grants due to having a large amount of money. 
 Now Kevin is older than 21 and is done school and is now working. His father got older and has been bed ridden, taking care of him and hiring a full time caregiver has divided the family as no family wants to put the time effort or money to help. Since Kevin still lives with his dad he has to help out at home and his mom works as well. Kevin no longer speaks to any of his half siblings to keep away from the drama.
Now Kevin has asked Martha to give him the money he is entitled to as he is of age and wants to pay off student loans and apply to a master's program. Martha has refused saying the money was on a condition kevins mom wasn't working and the fact that Kevin seperated himself from the family and she needs to help the other siblings who are all older and have families. 
 Only a lawyer was given the will of Jackie and that money was to be distributed as per the will by Martha. Kevin has never seen the will or has no idea if Martha was initially being kind and paying for his tuition herself using Jackie's will as a way to give the money or if it was actually part of the will. 
 How can my buddy best go about requesting either a copy of the will from the lawyer/finding his portion of the money. And ultimately how does he get what he was entitled to?","Kevins older sister passes away leaving Kevin 50k for school managed by older sister Martha. Martha is now refusing to pay the amount.

"Hi, 
 A little about me: I'm a 23 year old male medical student living in (insert midwest town here). I am also part of a very specific religious and cultural minority group. I'm content with this, however it makes dating extremely difficult as there are VERY few girls of similar heritage in (insert midwest town here). 
 The other day, while perusing Facebook, I ran across the profile page of a very attractive girl who happens to be from the same background as me. She is 21 years old and lives in (insert another midwest town 5 hours away). We happen to have one mutual friend - an older guy (who might be her cousin) who I don't really know that well. 
 I really want to get to know her, but it seems my options are limited. I already tried getting ""tight"" with our mutual friend (he seems to know the girl pretty well as they have several photos together), however we don't really have much in common, nor do we have much to talk about (I've only met him once).

"There's a huge difference between the gifted programs on the 80's and 90's and the gifted programs today.  There's a lot of really great programs today - as long as you research them as a parent and become informed and involved in your kid's education, you're likely to find some good ones that will really challenge and motivate your kids. 
 My school recommended me for the gifted program pretty quick, but my mother was against it.  She looked into what the program was at my elementary school ('94) and said, ""NOPE!""  It was indeed a joke, and did nothing but give that group of kids an over-inflated sense of self worth. 
 She sort of half-home-schooled me instead.  She negotiated with my teachers to let her do my math lessons - so I was always a good 2 years ahead in math.  I started a few high school classes in middle school, and some college classes in high school. 
 At 16 I started to hate high school and begged to be aloud to drop out and just take the GED.  She wouldn't let me.  So I skipped a year instead - did my Jr. and Sr. years in 1 year instead of 2 to go to college at 17.  I also refused to do anything higher than Calculus, so my math stopped progressing in 9th grade. 
 However it was the same as a lot of people on here are saying - I was positive that whatever I did utilizing my minimal effort was always going to be good enough if not great.  College came around and wrecked me - having to do homework outside of class wrecked me - and having to actually read the textbook and study wrecked me.

"Little bit long but this story means the world to me, had to share with my Ents...I am on cloud   right now. On Friday, I had my final interview with a big investment bank in NYC (obviously can't name them). It's my dream job to work on Wall Street and I was shocked I had made it so far with so much other talent vying for the spot. I had to pay for college myself, and I didn't go to the best school but I worked my ass off and focused on getting good grades. The last round of interviews took place with the head of HR. Typical business type: serious attitude, expects a lot of the employees and takes no shit. I was so nervous that I was gonna say something stupid and f*ck up my chances. 
 And that's exactly what I did...or so I thought. After the usual questions about why I want the position, Mr. HR man throws me a real curveball- ""What do you like to do to relax?"". Instantly, my mind goes to that fat 2 gram J that's waiting for me in the car (was planning on celebrating if things went well).  I froze for a second and stammered a bit, and Mr. HR took advantage of me being caught off guard. To my complete horror the worst words I could imagine came out of his mouth: ""You like to smoke weed son?"". I nearly shit myself and all the color left my face. I saw my whole future flash before my eyes, all the dreams and hopes that I had carried with me for so long vanished. I sat there for what seemed like 5 years, until I could finally blurt out that I had never touched drugs but he put his hand up with the fire of a thousand suns in his eyes. I thought for sure he was going to throw me out of his office right there. We're sitting in silence, me completely devastated that I had thrown away the best job opportunity ever, and him looking like he could kill me on the spot. Then, out of nowhere, he starts laughing his ass off. I'm still completely frozen I have no idea what to do. He tells me I'm an excellent candidate, and that if I smoke weed I should fit in just fine around here. He offered me the job right on the spot, and next thing I know I'm sitting in my car unable to believe what just happened to me. I drove home and roasted this fat doob in celebration (and to make my heart stop racing). Thinking of you ents!

"This is actually for my husband, who got his degree in Elementary Education in 2008. He's been looking for a full time teaching position since then. His Ohio license was K-3 with reading specialty, and he's since gotten 4-5 added (and the new Reading endorsement). We happen to live in an area oversaturated with teachers, so we knew it would be tough, but not this tough. 
 He's subbed, long-term subbed, and is currently teaching Title 1 (which is part-time/hourly). After years of bouncing around between schools, he decided to focus on one district to ""get in"" with the administration. He long term subbed for a year, and this is his second year in Title 1 there. (He's applied for full time in other districts though.) They love him there, but apparently not enough to hire him full time. 
 He's applied to every posting, and gotten ONE interview since 2008. He was top of his class has had stellar letters of recommendation everywhere he's worked. The problems I see is that he doesn't ""know"" anyone and he's not very aggressive or outgoing. He is much more comfortable in a classroom of kids than a room full of teachers and administrators. He's a 42 year old married man with kids (I don't know if that is helpful for him or not). I feel like he's missing something about the teaching ""culture""... and I certainly don't understand it. He's been told that the Title 1 teachers are like the ""interns"" and they often hire from there, but I don't trust them to be looking out for his best interests either. (If he's good at Title 1, why would they want to have to pay him more?) 
 So here we are 6 years later, and I'm wondering when we will have to give up on his dream. I have a decent job, but it's not enough to support a family of 5 for this long. We're sinking pretty fast. Every year we're optimistic that this will be the year it will turn around, and then we hit September. He likes Title 1, he loves teaching and he's good at it, but financially it's just not going to work. Even a ""meager"" starting teaching salary of $20K would be more than double what he makes now, plus actual benefits. 
 Any thoughts or advice would be helpful. We're so entrenched I wonder if there's something he's missing.","Qualified, good teacher can't find a job after 6 years. Stay underemployed in teaching or just give up and go back to bartending?",42,M,Teachers

"And I wanted to talk about it! 
 Background: I live in Canada, I'm 22M, and this is (jackass!) a throwaway. I'm not particuarly gay and I read that anal has been more and more common among heterosexuals lately so I don't feel weird or anything about it and I always wanted to try it. I've always had a very low level of prudishness(?) and am willing to try pretty much anything at least once and wanted to share my experience with everyone, particularly other males who are considering anal but don't know what to expect. Not that I am an expert or anything, this was only my first time too. 
 There was no partner involved, just some toys I ordered online. It took until now for me to realize that I'm an adult with my own apartment and credit card, and I can finally buy some toys to try out. My haul included: 
 
 A  9"" Blue Jelly Rubber Dildo  ( which I found out after the fact was not the best choice, see here for details  but my gag reflex was too strong, so that idea was out since I wasn't going to try it again after I'd used it anywhere but my mouth no matter how much I cleaned it. Up to that point I'd already loosened myself up gradually with other toys so that when I finally inserted this one, there was next to no discomfort in the penetration. I was surprised to find I could take all 9 inches up to the hilt on my very first time (is that normal?), and having all of it inside me was very satisfying. The only downside to this toy, besides learning later about the rubber thing, was that it had a very poor suction cup on its base, making mounting it on the wall or anything dificult, and no form of adhesive like tape will stick to it for very long. In the end I constructed a sort of holster out of tape folded in on itsself that the rubbery balls portion docks with and remains locked tightly. I hope I can find a pthalate-free alternative/replacement. If anyone has any suggestions, please share! 
 
 A  Generic Wireless Remote Vibrator . It has one speed and seven options for the rhythm. Pink and waterproof! It's starting speed was a bit strong at first, but became very enjoyable after I grew acclimated to it. 
 
 A  second hard plastic vibrator , this one long and thin. It has a dial for speed at the base and goes faster then anything else I bought. Stimulating! 
 
 A  Small  (possibly jelly, I should double check that)  Vibrating Buttplug . It wasn't very satisfying since at its widest it was still smaller then pretty much all the other toys I got, but still nice for getting used to having things inside me. 
 
 **[An Aneros Helix]( This didn't really work all that well for me because I don't have very strong muscles down there. I was not able to clench or unclench very hard, long, or often enough to achieve any significant sensation, but I won't rule this out until I've had more practice with it. 
 
 An intimidating clinical-looking metal thing called the  Pure Wand  (formerly Jupiter Wand.) I haven't actually tried this one yet but I've read nothing but positive reviews about it. If anyone here has one, please share your experiences with it. 
 
 Hard Plastic  Anal Beads . They're a weird wavy shape but I am eager to try them out soon. 
 
 That concludes the penetrative purchases, other things I bought were a rubbery red  cock ring  (It's kind of tight but I think that's the point. I didn't particularly enjoy the feeling of all the blood trapped down there or seeing parts of me turn red,  coupled with reading about the risks , and a pair of  nipple suckers  (black PVC cylinders with a sphere the size of a Mirabelle plum you compress to create suction. Hair gets in the way so its good to be clean shaved anywhere you plan on using them, but otherwise they offer a very strong suction feeling and rarely fall free.) 
 
 Last but not least, bottles of a  silicone-based lubricant , a  water-based lubricant , and a  toy cleaning disinfectant type deal  ([which I am now having second thoughts about after reading this comment]( I found the silicone-based was not as lubricating as the water-based, but lasted much longer. Water-based was very slippery but required more and more often applicated to yield desireable results. As always, take care to avoid using silicone based lubricant in conjunction with silicone based toys. 
 
 
 Kind of a lot for first time buying, right? In the end it came out to be about 200$, since a lot of it was on sale. The metal Pure Wand dealie is usually around 100$ on its own so I'm pretty happy with what I got. The only product I didn't get in this initial spree I was interested in was an inflatable buttplug. If anyone has any experience with these, please feel free to share! 
 Enough stories from me though, I do have questions too, beyond the ones asking about the specifics of various toys I mentioned before! Most of all my biggest concerns are about keeping myself and my new toys clean, avoiding any common problems, infections, or injuries I as a newcomer may face (are there even common injuries?) and most of all, I'd like to hear about others experiences with toys and their recommendations of products I might consider in the future.",Bought a bunch of toys and stuck them in my butt.

"When I was 15, I would go to the church of this girl of whom I had a crush on. I was still somewhat religious at the time but was appalled at what I experienced.

"First of all, let me say I hope I'm doing this right!  I'm probably the oldest person here, but my daughter is a ""Redditor"" and suggested I get what's on my chest off and maybe hear some different perspectives - so here goes! 
 My ex-husband and I divorced almost four years ago.  I've dated a little since then, but nothing too serious.  About six or seven months ago I reconnected with an old neighbor (and when I say ""old"" I mean we were in Jr. High when we lived next to one another!).  ""Shawn"" walked up to me at the airport to re-introduce himself after he heard me paged and recognized the name, we clicked really well, he offered to split a cab home with me and we've been dating ever since. 
 We have quite a lot in common:  we both own our own businesses, we are both very into theatre (he acts and so does my son and daughter), our kids are right in the same age range (mid-twenties), and we both love to travel and dine out.  My son is gay and (while this had made other men I've dated uncomfortable) Shawn isn't concerned at all. 
 So the issue I'm having is this:  Shawn has several women friends, one in particular whom he texts and calls on a frequent basis.  We'll call her ""Amber.""  They met through the theatre and dated for a very brief period of time.  Shawn doesn't hide that he's still friends with her or that they were together, and when I asked why they broke up he honestly explained they were just at different points in their lives and careers and were incompatible.  He says she wasn't ""looking for anything serious"" with him.  I've seen her texts and been in the same room when he's talked to her on the phone - nothing flirtatious really, in fact they mostly discuss theatre and books and business. 
 So no big deal, right?  I didn't think so until I was introduced to Amber the other day.  Though I had never asked what she looks like or how old she is, I had a picture in my mind that resembled, well, someone a lot more like me in size, shape, and age.  Nope.  She's barely 30 and looks like she fell off the cover of a magazine!  The waitress asked her for ID when she ordered a glass of wine for goodness sakes! 
 I'll admit that while I didn't feel threatened I did feel a little pang of jealousy.  That's normal I think and I'm not concerned.  What I really couldn't get over though was the fact that Shawn dated someone who's our kids' ages!  There's something about it that just makes me feel strange and uncomfortable.  She's a very bright girl and mature and accomplished for her age, but I can't shake the case of ""heebie jeebies"" I got seeing them together.  His nickname for her is ""BK,"" and that's also how she appears in his phone.  I finally asked what it stood for after we all met and he said, ""baby kitten.""  I know they're both adults but that just made me feel icky inside. 
 Am I the only one who thinks this situation is/was a little creepy or am I overreacting?  If I am, how can I look at this to get over it?  I really like Shawn and would like a future with him, but this makes me look at him differently.

"I am a 30/F. I am not a very jealous person. My 34/M SO of a year and I were out one day a couple months ago. I had no service on my phone and asked to use his to look something up on the internet. When I opened the web browser one of the quick links was to a porn site. I shrugged it off, but we have been together for quite some time and never knew that he was watching it. 
 When I needed to use his phone again about a week later I decided to check his history and found that he watching porn usually at least once a week. 
 We have a very intimate relationship and do have sex almost every day. Why would he still feel the need to watch porn (I am assuming when I leave for work in the morning and he is getting ready because that is the only time that he is really not around me other than when he is at work himself)? 
 I honestly just want to know if it is just normal or if I should be worried that this might mean that he would be more likely to cheat on me? 
 The fact that he is hiding that he does it bothers me.

"I've been waiting to share this story since I joined Reddit.  It's a bit of a novel but to this day my words and actions are checked because of this event. All having to do with an event that happened back in the 5th grade day... 
 I had come home from school one day and overheard one of my friends using the word prostitute (I think it was a South Park episode that he had watched).  So I, being the naive sheltered kid started using the word and soon enough it had become an integrated part of my vocab. 
 I was at a golf camp that summer for kids ages 8-14.  I was playing a match against my friends little 8 year old brother and when something would not go my way I would say ""Wow... what a gay prostitute."" I had called him a ""gay prostitute"" a bunch of times throughout the course of the round, not really thinking anything of it because hey, I had no idea what it meant and they were just words. 
 Fast forward two days later... I'm in my room building the Imperial Tie Fighter lego kit and I hear my mom SCREAM my name from downstairs telling me to get downstairs immediately. The usage of the middle name was the dead giveaway that I was FUCKED, but I digress. I see both of my parents at the foot of the stairs and my Dad looks me dead in the eyes and says: ""So you think you're a big tough guy huh?"" I replied with a shaky ""What?"" to which he responded ""Don't give me that 'What' shit"" (my parents don't swear so this was a huge 'this is how I die' moment). My mom was crying and told me to get in the car. 
 She told me she had received a call from my friends dad who told me the little brother had been brooding in his room since that day.  His dad asked him what was wrong and he asked his dad what a ""gay prostitute"" was.  They had to have a family meeting to discuss what had happened, decided to notify the golf course of the event, and notify my parents.  We drove 4 minutes down the road to his house where his entire family were outside waiting for me.  I have never been so sorry about anything in my whole life.  Those two words had ruined his innocence.  I cried in front of his whole family and my mom and begged them to forgive me. Which they did.  I also got a call from the Head Pro saying she wanted to have a meeting with me and told me that her initial reaction was she wanted to bar me from playing in the rest of the camp but his family kindly said that was a little extreme. 
 Looking back on this event it I know this 100% changed me and helped make me who I am today.  I've bumped into them a couple of times since (no longer living by me) and I feel so awkward and awful many years later.  I wish I could take those words back but younger me needed a reality intervention quick.","My friends 8 year old brother played golf with me I was in 5th grade at the time.

"I was in disneyland on a band field trip in sixth grade and a girl asked to borrow my disneyland hat(the ones with the mickey ears on them) and I said sure why not. She then starts running away giggling and I'm like wtf this girl jacked my hat. She uses the crowd to her advantage to get ahead of me and when she had enough room seperating me and her, she bites her bottom lip and makes a kissy face to me and this whole time I'm just concerned about getting my hat back because it cost 30 dollars. She then follows me to go to the tower of terror in California adventures and I was with my buddy who was kind of nerdy so he cries in the line to the ride wussing out leaving me and this girl alone together. She then says I'm scared on the ride and grabs my arm and tells me to hug her. After the park closes, we all go to our hotel around 1 am and she ask me if I want to go in the hot tub and I say yes but I also say ""all the bros can come too"" and she kind of sighs and says sure. At this point I was realizing she was trying to make a move but just fucked up at the same time. All the guys come but they go in the swimming pool and she holds my arm and brings me to the hot tub so I can't join the guys even though I actually want to be with her at this point but nothing happens because the hot tub was right next to the pool so there is no privacy. We then shower to get rid of chlorine and then go get some mcdonalds at 2 in the morning just me and her. We then check in with the parents because we have a curfew and they duct tape our doors in the hotel room so that if you open your door after they duct taped it, they can see that you escaped because the tape would be messed up. The hotel room was those kind of rooms where it was one room and could become 2 rooms if you removed the divider between two rooms and I lucked out and shared a room with her. I got neked with my first girl and we made out, did 69, oral, anal, fingering , and she gave me a hj with some of the hotels lotion. but no actual sex because as a 12 year old 6th grader, kids knew what got a girl pregnant and what getting laid was. We then shower together and spoon in bed till we fell asleep.

"So there's this wonderful girl i met she is 24, i'm 30 male (relationship length is 7 weeks), and we hit things off the first time we hung out. So we've been seeing each other twice a week, as schedules allow. And so after 7 weeks of being totally into each other. I decided to get this bright idea to add her on facebook. Well her little brother sees me as a friend on her fb profile, and calls her out on it. And he tells her that he's met me before at a party, and he doesn't think too positively of me, and must've badmouthed me. 
 At the party i behaved, didnt do anything untowards and had a fun time, yet he acts like he saw me doing something heinous. Which is madness, i guess hanging out with friends and having a drink is illegal. 
 So I asked her what do you believe, and she said she's seen my actions, but now she's stressed that her brother doesn't like me. I asked her does she want me to stop calling her, she said no, do you want to unfriend on facebook, she said no. She asked me what i'm looking for i said possibly long term, so I asked her what she's looking for she said she entered it with an open heart, and open mind. So i said do you want a fling/short term? She said no, long term would be preferred. 
 I haven't disrespected her brother, and she says she cares for me, i told her to have a day to think about the situation. And at least tell me what's going on. All her replies are when I've asked her, so if i'm a good guy, and your brother is being a brother and being overprotective, I want to know where we are at or what's going on, she says ""I don't know"".

"23/M. I know I should immediately go see a counseler but it's pretty hard to keep the motivation up enough to follow through. It's taken most of an hour to write this and I'm at the point of deleting it entirely. Please take this as it is and share advice. I may be too embarassed to look at it ever again but I'll leave it open in my browser for the morning. I've been drinking for a few hours(this is a daily norm) so this emotional outburst and lack of finish should make sense. 
 This is entirely a scatterbrained drop of the things that bother me most. Some things exaggerated and others the opposite. Though I truely feel manic sometimes and so that may be entirely true depending on the day. I've been raised in an emotionally abusive/inattentive family who never had me follow any schedules or  teach me to take any real care of myself regularly. All the love and action was there from mom at least except she really has all of them same problems I do. Alcoholism took massive tolls on her throughout my teens and she's done nothing but sit in our living room watching television and sleeping on the couch in the same place. The idea of happier future keep her trying through her days without any real effect. It used to be against my father until he left for many longs stints for work far away. She'd continued to as she considered it her ""place in this home"". She used to try and act as a mother until she realized my brother took after my dad and laughed at any attempts by her, and I was so depressed and introverted that I simply withdrew from most all interaction. This has been going on for more than half of my life now. I 've had an alright part time job for more than 4 years now. They call me the best and say they can't do without me but they forget to mention my emotional instability at least an 8th of the time. My room and car and both absolutely filthy and I'd be embarassed to even upload a photo on this throwaway account. I cannot stand most of my ""friends"" these days and the few I can always end up with pointless drinking sessions and talks of no relevance to anything I care about. I'm regurally drinking too much and taking advantage of my Adderoll. The combination of these two, plus coffee and cigarettes, leads into schizophrenic feelings sometimes and leave me a feeling of disconnect from reality. Many panic attacks arise from this including the fear of me hurting myself. I have good times for a few months at a time where I hold my head up during the day and appear to have my shit together but be a very quiet man. Other times for a month or so I'll stare at the ground throughout the day unable to make eye contact with anyone I feel no connection to. Social anxiety keeps me from making relations with the people who could have a real effect on my life. When I'm alone I sit on my computer and either completely idle for long times or sink into video games until exhaustion puts me to sleep. 
 I've seen three counselers in the past 10 years. Each time I went at them full force explaining the majority of my problems but acting them down each time after until I felt they did not understand me. I feel like I need a person with me every moment outside of work for months until I learn how to live indepentantly but this is obviously unrealistic.",What do you do when you have nothing to build from?

"I am a 24 y.o F planning on moving out to be closer to work and since I can afford it financially. 
 I have found two places, both for the same price. 
 One is a tiny studio apartment built off of a main house. Owned by a very sweet couple with 2 little ones. My living area is completely private and seperated. It is very tiny and about 10 miles from work. It is probably about 150 sqft but is fully furnished and the perfect size for just one person. 
 The other option I have is to room with a 27 y.o F in a 1400 sqft apartment. I would have my own room and my own bathroom. We've been corresponding back and forth and seem to have a lot in common and communication seems to be very important to her, which is a huge point for me. She is not too concerned with me having people over, I am not a big partier so I would not have people over too often and if I did it would be my boyfriend or a girlfriend or two. This apartment is about 12 miles from my job and in a gated community with a gym, pool, Jacuzzi, and carport. 
 I have had roommates before and I am very easy to live with. This would be my first time out on my own by choice. My first experience with roommates was negative since I did not choose them and our personalities clashed. I dealt with it since I was so far from home.

"Hey, first of all I want to say congratulations to everyone that takes part in this challenge. 
 I'm 20 years old and for as long as I remember I've been fapping, almost once a day. Today I decided that things has to change.

"So I've been with my SO coming up on 4 years now, long distance for most of it, and have been living together for two months. In short it's been great. The one of the things that always comes up in our relationship is what we want to do for our careers. Until yesterday, we were both still unsure as to where we want to go post-college life. 
 Yesterday she returned home from a 2 day trip to see her parents, and told me that she had news: she wants to open a boutique! She thinks she has the vision and taste (and it's true, from an objective standpoint she does have great taste) to pull it off. When I asked her what her timeline was like, she told me that she would like to start, optimistically, a year from now. 
 The problem is that I was totally not receptive to this idea, and got very quiet and subdued as she explained it to me. There were so many thoughts flying through my head that were not positive. 
 For one, I only make $22 a year, and she works as a higher-level tech in the theater world, making somewhere around $10K per year at best. There's no way we'd be able to fund something like that in a year. 
 When I brought up the idea of how this gets funded, she replied that we could just take out a small business loan to get us started; she thinks this would hopefully be when we get married in the future. Since my parents paid for my schooling in full and we have low rent, I've never had to go into debt for anything. And now my SO is asking me to go into debt with her and risk my credit score for a venture that has a very high chance of not working out. And that really just isn't sitting well with me. 
 And not to mention the fact that if we do this, it'll be a huge time sink. We'll have no time to go and do the travelling we talked about. Hell, we won't even be able to leave for a weekend. I'm only 24, and she's asking me to sacrifice so much time and money so early in my (and our) life? 
 So these are a few of the thoughts I have going on right now. It's honestly scaring the crap out of me. She was pretty upset that I wasn't immediately on board and supportive of the idea when she told me either. I'm not sure if it's something where I was just supposed to say ""oh yeah, that sounds great. You have my full support as your significant other."" Or was I supposed to give constructive criticism? 
 Heck, I'm even just wondering if I'm making this about myself too much? Possibly a ""molehill into mountain thing"" Maybe there's another perspective that I'm missing. I'm just not sure at the moment. I just know that I'm going crazy in my head over this, and I just need an outside perspective to tell me whether or not I'm right be ambivalent / freaked out. So whatever you guys have to offer, I'm all ears.","Girlfriend abruptly decided that her next move in her career path, at 23, was to open her own boutique. Am now officially freaked the fuck out.

"So I'[m 31] going to tango lessons. 
 I'm overweight. I'm going to the gym and to tango to improve my image and to improve my social skills. 
 I recently split with a girl from 8 years of no definition, pure stagnation. 
 I really need to start meeting new girls without looking for the close. Just for the fun of knowing someone. I tend to metamorph into what the girl like, if I found some girl that my like me. 
 I don't want to do that. 
 I also tend to get infatuated with girls out of my league just living in my head the whole interaction. If I have no desire to get together with a girl, I feel free to be around without expectations. 
 That's what I want. To be able to be around girls with my mind free to actually learn some tango, and also to learn to have better, deeper relationships. And if I really like a girl and she likes me back then it's on, and is real. 
 But until that I just want to focus in the dance and in the relationships without forcing any escalation. 
 So this girl I'm dancing with have musical background. And this one time she told to the group that if she feels that the dancer (in tango the man always takes the lead) doesn't go with the music she make him stop or slow down. 
 She is the only one that I have problems to lead. She is like always with delay after my mark. 
 So, thinking that It could be that I just sucks at tango, or maybe she is slowing me down for the sake of the music, or maybe she is doing something wrong, I confront her with this (maybe the word confront is too strong for this situation, but I don't know a softer word). 
 I only name the possibility  of being my mistake because I really don't know enough to tell, and I don't want to just blame her. 
 The first thing she saids is: ""maybe I make you feel nervous"". 
 That really took me by surprise. I never made a move on her. I actually don't feel there is even a connection. I feel better with other girls in that class. 
 I was feeling a bit low. In another time I could maybe said something like ""why would you make me feel nervous about?"", but I just made a surprise face. 
 Then she rapidly changed the subject saying that maybe she sucks at tango. 
 Then an interruption occurred and she sat to change her shoes (the tango lesson was ending). I took that move like an evasion on keeping the talk. I sat to change my shoes and said goodbye. 
 So did she thinks I want something with her? 
 I reckon I feel that I can't break the ice with her. I kind of feel tense. But is a general thing. I'm learning my way in trying to have better relationships, but I don't feel confident enough at the moment.

"I was playing scrum half for my small liberal arts college rugby team about five years ago.  We played some bigger schools in the area (it would literally have been impossible to go to smaller college than me, barring Deep Springs), where a lot of the football players would suit up for rugby in the offseason, and my team was definitely on the smaller side.  Hell, we don't even have a football team. 
 Anyway, if you know how rugby works the scrum half is often right up by the rucks and the forwards' action.  Since my team was on the smaller size, I ended up going in and tackling a lot of their locks, flankers, props, the works.  With good form, it wasn't all that bad, and a few broken wrists, a concussion, stitches were all par for the course.  Until I ruptured a kidney. 
 It was the end of the first game of a double-header.  I scooped the ball on a pick-and-go and ran up the field, actually breaking a few tackles.  I was winded as fuck and this number 8 or whatever from god knows where drills me right in the kidney.  God, it was excruciating.  Rolled and planted, and I finished the last five minutes of the game.  Go off the field and start downing sunflower seeds, Advil, and Gatorade, getting ready for the second game (not really related, but it was 85 and muggy as hell that day). 
 I hit the portapotty right before the second game to empty the tank, thinking I was fine and going to power through it.  Only I wasn't emptying the tank.  I found out later that the trauma was forcing blood into the urinary tract and I was peeing it out.  Anyway, after the second game I had my buddies drop me off at the ER where I checked myself in.  I spent the next day in the ICU with the surgeons wondering if I would need emergency surgery to stop the blood pouring into my abdomen, but it actually healed up on its own.  Overall, two and a half days in the hospital, but I was actually happy to catch every game of march madness round of 32 that year.","ruptured kidney playing rugby, spent two days in the hospital while the docs wondered if I was going to bleed out internally.",24,M,AskReddit

 To put it very simply, horrible and I didn't. 
 It scarred me because my peers became vicious, incomprehensible, and abusive. I was even more aware of how I didn't understand others and how I didn't fit in. My self-harm began at puberty in response to this and the home environment. I used to love school and learning but now I dreaded going there. Even the teachers began treating me as a pariah; I was the easy target among the group of lower class tear-aways (I've always been poor as dirt) so they'd use me to vent their frustrations for little to no reason at all. 
 Then my mother couldn't handle me. After already being moved school due to bullying, I was then moved to the Highlands 6 hours away to live with my Dad in the middle of nowhere because I was 'too much for her'. New school and completely separated from the very few kids outside of my old high school who were actually accepting of me. Self-harm intensified. 
 Then I ran away back to the capital while still 15 and hid with an 18 year old who'd already gave me booze and initiated the sex which led to me losing my virginity. Hid out until 2 weeks later when the cops came in and found us naked. Interrogated by the police on my own because I was too afraid to see my mother and was forced to give a statement. 
 I was told later that almost everybody in that grouping of friends now hated me and blamed me for it. 
 Then another older guy started a sexual relationship with me when I was 16 and introduced to hard drugs. He suddenly stopped the fling but still let me live there as I couldn't live with my mother, and I didn't understand why. It was confusing, distressful, and exhausting. I attempted suicide during this time. 
 That all fell apart by a combination of a scheming 'friend' and a huge miscommunication and I moved to a 40 year olds who gave me loads of MDMA and tried to start a sexual thing with me then kicked me out when I wouldn't reciprocate (I again made an attempt at suicide but was so drunk I couldn't manage - still deep scars on my left arm though) some time trying to stay with an ex who also kicked me out, then gave up and lived with a narcissistic grandmother. 
 While still 15 a Dutch guy had got me to strip on cam (in fact, at much younger ages men were able to convince me to do things on cam). Anyway, at 16 and still living with abusive grandmother who wouldn't respect my boundaries--hugged me when I had specifically told her it would hurt--this Dutch guy basically groomed me and three to six months into the relationship decided to tell me that he was attracted to pre-teens. This was while I was drunk. I was confused and morbidly curious and asked what the worst thing he had was. He sent me something horrifying but I tried my best to fit in because nobody was around me any more apart from my toxic grandmother. I never did anything to any child, but found myself being manipulated and twisted by him. After a year I finally managed to break free. 
 Met another Dutch guy at 17 and moved over to live with him about half a year later. He was in debt from 6 years prior and was depressed. He made no attempt to communicate with me or understand me and after a year he sent me home because he couldn't handle my illnesses then was surprised when I broke up with him due to long distance. 
 Stayed with friends who eventually dumped me for no reason for a while before moving to a youth hostel, then temporary accommodation, then a scummy high rise flat, the same in which I grew up in. I was miserable there, became an agoraphobe, and lived in filth. 
 Luckily near the end of adolescence I dated a guy who became a flatmate and unofficial carer even after we split up. I worked out who 'good' people were and who 'bad' people were and just after adolescence I scored a far nicer flat in a better area. 
 I've had difficulties since then, of course, but adolescence was hell. 
 I realise now how much of it was due to miscommunication, misunderstanding what people meant, not being aware of intentions, not being able to handle other peoples' emotions, and simply not having the same framework others appeared to have. 
 My mother always called me 'crazy' and told me I was actually clinically ill before I even hit puberty. I wish I had seen a doctor. Maybe some of this wouldn't have happened.",It was horrible and I only got through it because I botched suicide attempts.,21,F,aspergers
"I'm twenty-three and have been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder since I was mid-teens. I've been medicated since then as well barring a short period which did not work out well. 
 I graduated university this year after a very drawn out issue with a professor. It was very messy, I was directed to take it afterward to the human rights tribunal because of the professor’s actions, the anxiety it caused was devastating. That’s really all I want to get into it with. But I did graduate. 
 After I graduated I started a new job. It is in sales. I’ve always done retail sales but this is calls and even though I thought I’d be fine (was fine in retail) I became completely and utterly unable to function. I have had panic attacks (diagnosed after reporting them to my doctor) at my desk, cried, and have self harmed in the car on my break. I know it sounds pathetic, it's just a job, but I simply cannot handle it. 
 I also cannot quit because of the environment I live in at home and the hostility it would create with my parents if I did (I quit a job once at age 19 because it was 2 months in and I hadn't been paid, I have still not been forgiven for this). The holidays were also brutal. My family is odd to say the least and it is difficult to be around them during the holidays all together. My fiance's family was toxic this holiday. There were a lot of tears and a lot of hurt throughout. 
 I am living with my parents after graduation, so I went from a small bachelor apartment to my childhood home. My fiance is finished school in May and when he does we will move in together because we can be in the same city. There are many reasons why right now it is impossible to live together. Living on my own is possible but extremely difficult in many ways including getting locked into a lease when we don't know where we're going to be moving when he's done. I feel like I’m in a holding period, just waiting. 
 Family life is getting worse, my father as of late has been cruel to my mom and me and is making it impossible to be around him. There are some factors that could be causing it but in general we aren’t sure what exactly has happened with him. I feel so trapped and all of it has to do with work or family/living situation. I handled my family life alright (not quite as bad but never good, in general we're an odd bunch) before this job and I have handled stress at jobs and school when not living with my family. Both? Honestly impossible. So that's the problem, can't quit because of family, can't leave family without job, can't function at job because of everything else. 
 As a result of all this:","I am very suicidal, have thought about how I would do it and when and planned it. I cry every day. I self harm most days. I have written letters (not quite suicide letters) to people. 
 I really would appreciate any help. My parents are against 'the hospital' but right now I have an action plan with my fiance and if I really feel suicidal I have to call him, then go to the hospital and he'll come back from school (about an hour). My doctor supports this plan and also has referred me to a psychiatrist; I live in a country with universal health care so treatment is not actually the issue financially. 
 Currently I am holding off on going to the hospital out of hope that a job interview I had will pan out. Also going will slow my job hunt down (obviously) and so afterward if I returned home then I would also be returning to that job. 
 This was really long. I think I needed to write it out just as much as I wanted advice or any kind of support. Please help. I want to kill myself but I don’t want to go.",23,F,SuicideWatch
"Mother here. Not sure if this really counts as my son I'm talking about is only 18. Anyway... 
 It's heartbreaking. He hasn't has a friend over for about 5 years, never mind a girlfriend/boyfriend. He hasn't been out in that time either apart from school either unless I've took him somewhere with me. 
 I tried to take him out a couple of times to play poker with some of my close friends he's known since childhood. He went twice and kicked ass at poker, laughed a little, seemed happy kinda. But for those few hours that he was out, his hands were shaking uncontrollably, he didn't speak much and tripped over his words when he tried. He seemed almost relieved when we left. 
It made me realise how crippling his social anxiety is. 
 He'll go to the shop for me if I ask him to but I know he'd prefer to stay in the house. 
 Seeing my friends' kids grow up and develop into young adults is bittersweet. I see their FB posts about parties, girlfriends, boyfriends, new jobs etc. I see them complain about hangovers and heartache, crap bosses, driving lessons, and their hopes of moving into their own places. 
 I don't hear any of that from my son. He's polite, funny, sweet, and kind. He's massively intelligent and and has a awesome sense of humour too. All I hear is about League of Legends, maybe a conversation about Homestuck once in a while. How maybe it would be nice to get Starbound as his main Chrismas gift from me. 
 It pains me to see his two younger siblings start their journeys of independence when his seems to have ground to a halt already. 
 I'm kinda scared for his future. I worry about him finding a job as he currently doesn't work and never has. I honestly can't see how he could as he's so introverted. I think even if he got a job interview he would blow it. You see teenagers with their inflated self confidence and preened-to-perfection looks. They'd be employed over my son any day. 
 Love life? Not gonna happen. He talks to no one so how could it? Unless he meets a sweet girl or guy on League of Legends then maybe I suppose. I know he ""chats"" on LoL to people. He used to on Mibbit too. Usernames that he knows from years of being a loner with only a PC for company. They're his only friends. He stays up late and pulls all-nighters as we're in the UK and ahead of the US time-wise. 
 As a mother, I'm lost. I don't know what to do but I figure he's gonna be living with me for life. I hope I'm mistaken.",It sucks. :(,46,F,AskReddit
"Background: I am not sure if this is required in this situation. But, I feel you can skip this part and go directly to the issue at hand if you don't want a long read. I come from a part of the world where arranged marriages are the norm. Relationships and love marriages are discouraged. I and my current wife met in college when we were around 19. We became good friends. Couple of years in, we realised we were perfect for each other and started a relationship. 
 Of course, back here, you don't marry whoever you want. You need your parents approval. The only reason we were able to have an actual real relationship was because we studied in a different city(Not very common here) than our parents. My parents were cool about it. She had to do a lot of convincing on her side and stuck it out till her parents relented. We got engaged, completed our studies , worked for a bit and got married a year ago.Now, I have felt I have always known her inside out as she spent a lot of time with me in college.  I had my own place and she spent a large amount of her time with me. She is a great girl. We enjoy each others company and love each other to bits. 
 Marriage has been great. We have had the same friends circle in college. They look towards us as a holy grail of a couple since none of them got to marry/be together with their gf/bf coz of one issue or the other. None of our friends had felt anything off about her ever. The friends in our circle who were girls were her room mates in a hostel. So, I was not prepared for the surprise I got yesterday. 
 The current issue is that I walked in on her talking to herself. I cracked up at first and then asked her what it was about. She was embarrassed and I comfort her and try to get the issue out of her. She  was uncomfortable but finally relents and says she likes speaking to herself. She talks about daily stuff and life to herself. She says she imagines me or any one of her close friends in front of her and talk to them. She has been doing this since she was a kid and never grew out of it. She started crying and was very embarrassed. I comforted her and convinced her it’s no issue and everybody has their own quirks and haven't brought it up since. 
 Now, here is what has me worried. Is this anything to do with a mental issue or will escalate to a mental issue?Am I overthinking a quirk? Being in a country, where going to a therapist/Shrink is a huge taboo,I am not sure what to do. Not  to  mention the poor quality of them. Also, it would be break her heart if I said I thought she has an issue and need to see a shrink. Am I to be blamed for this? Am I not giving her enough time? She is currently not working as she had to undergo a laproscopic surgery for an ectopic pregnancy a couple of months ago. And we had decided to allow her few months rest before she gets her new job. Is her loneliness causing her to do this? 
 We don't have many friends in the current city we live in. I have been occasionally take her out with my best friend and his wife and she enjoys the company.","My SO of 7 years likes speaking to herself. She has full on conversations. She imagines her friends and talks to them about daily stuff. Can this be a mental issue or escalate to one? 
 Update: Thanks guys for clearing my doubts. Apparently, talking to oneself is pretty normal and nothing to be concerned about. For the record, I told her yesterday itself that it was just an outlet to express oneself similar to how I and other people like writing diaries to express their inner thoughts.She was happy after listening to that.But, I felt concerns whether it might be an initial sign of a mental issue. Thanks again.

"On April 28th I decided to go with my frient to get some weed. We got to the house had a good time for a few min bought my weed then left to go back home with my frient. I was probably at a [7]. As we were going home I was long boarding having a blast. I did not realize the speed I was going. I started to wobble then fell off my board slamming the ground. I got up and my frient ran to know if I was okay. I just looked at my scratched up phone laying on the ground confused. I looked at my frient and asked what happen. He asked if I was serious. I had forgotten what we just did. My frient then knows that I have a concussion. He told me to give him the weed and I did. It was hard to think and I did not want weed on me looking all scratched up. Him not thinking of all the possibilities of how he could of saved the weed, he threw it in a ditch. I just looked saying I don't care. I start to freak out because I was really high, bleeding, had a concussion, and kept forgetting things real fast. My frient had to go to work so we rushed to his house as I kept asking bizarre questions. We finally get to his house. His parents are very worried and drives me to my house. My parents take me to the ER. I stayed conscious but could not remember anything. My parents kept asking me things..... then when I would of thought it would not get worse.... I tell them.... being as confused and high as I was...I told them I smoked weed.... I woke up in my room the next day not remembering anything. My mom told me what happened leaving out the part where I told her that I smoke weed. Today she tells me what I said. She was not mad and said we would discuss it later. It's just weird that my parents know. I feel like I disappointed them. I was also mad I lost 20 bucks. I was not mad at my frient. He was just trying to help. I don't blame weed for the accident either. It was my fault. I was not wearing a helmet (but who does?), I also should not of been going down such steep hills.  I am fine now and my memory is coming back now.  I will still smoke weed but not as much as I used to. Oh and my frient went to see if the weed was where he threw it but it was just a bag there with holes like a animal got to it. I hope I did not ruin anyone's high! I just thought I should share. You can also ask me questions about what else happened and I will reply! 
Well It was not a total downer! That same day my best friend was texting me saying that he found a girl that was my type. he sent me a picture of her. I was really confused but thought she was very pretty. My friend showed her a picture of me and she thought I was really cute! My mom called my friend and told him what happened. He then told me not to reply to the girl till I get better. I am now talking to the girl and she is very interesting etc etc!

"Hello JustNoMil,
I've (27F) been a lurker, sometimes commenter in this sub for a little bit..but have never posted. Mainly because I have trouble coherently writing my thoughts out instead of just rambling,so be patient with me.
Basically, my mother is a nutcase. not diagnosed but that doesn't take away from the crazy. She's always been clingy, overbearing, and emotionally draining. I basically was her parent growing up...those are many stories for other times. It has gotten a lot worse since I've had my son (he's 1 1/2 now). This may not seem too severe, but after everything else she has done..I'm at my wit's end.
My fiance (24M) and I (we have been together 4 years, but friends for many before that and have lived together almost those full 4 years) decided we were going to take our son (DS) to the zoo now that he is old enough to enjoy it. It would be his first trip, and I was super excited. I ended up mentioning it to my mom (I'm sure I'll have a nickname for her in the future..but I'm blanking). I thought she would be happy and excited for us to have this experience as our little family. Nope. So much nope. She lost her shit so hard. 
 Mom: The zoo sounds like fun, what time should I be ready to go?
Me: uh...what??
Mom: For the zoo. What time should I be ready for you to pick me up?
Me: Mom, it's just be and [fiance] taking DS.
Mom: Don't be silly. How about you pick me up at 9, that way we can be there when it opens. 
(the zoo is about 2 hours away, we were making a day trip of it.)
Me: We are just going the 3 of us, it's DS's first zoo trip, we want to do it just as a family.
Mom: I am your family. You and [fiance] aren't even married, he isn't your family.
Me: Mom, I'm not sure why you are arguing with me about this. He is my family, but furthermore he is DS's dad. I would be glad to send you pictures from our trip, and I'm sure there will be opportunities in the future for you to take DS to the zoo.
Mom: Nonsense, MY baby won't have fun at the zoo without me.
Me: Nonsense, I am 27 and perfectly capable of having a good time without my mom tagging along.
Mom: I was talking about DS.
Me: You said your baby. I am your baby. DS is my baby.
 The crazy eyes started bulging after that 
Mom: I am not discussing this anymore. I will be ready to go at 8 am.
Me: For the last time, you are not going with us.
Mom:  Screaming  YOU CAN'T TAKE MY BABY TO THE ZOO WITHOUT ME. THIS IS A VIOLATION OF MY RIGHTS.
 My state doesn't have grandparent's rights unless I die and my fiance then refuses to let DS see her.
Me: You don't have any right to MY child. And if you keep carrying on like an imbecile, you won't have any priveleges to him either. Now stop screaming or get out of my house. Then of course she starts crying 
Mom: I don't know why you don't love me, I did everything for you.
Me:  Gently ushered her outside  It's time for DS's nap, and I am not interested in continuing this argument. 
Mom:  continues screaming* YOU BITCH. THAT IS MY BABY AND HE'S ONLY HAPPY WHEN I'M AROUND. HE DOESN'T EVEN LIKE YOU. 
 After that I closed the door and called my step dad. I told him that if he didn't come get her immediately I was calling the police. He did and she left. I'm just pissed and amused and exhausted at the same time.","My mother freaked out because we didn't invite her to the zoo. Said I was violating her rights, and my son hates me and only loves her.

"Edit: Title should be: I don't know how to ""be"" anymore 
 Hi all, sorry if the coming text doesn't make sense. I tend to write things one shot. 
 I've been lurking this sub for quite a while now and it took me a long time to gather my will to post here. I guess I just need to vent and blow off some steam... 
 Here it goes. 
 I don't know how to live anymore. No suicidal thoughts but I dont know what to do or how to improve. 
 I think my problems can be separated into five areas: health, social, motivation, Hobby and family 
 Let me start with health. I'm 23 years old 5'11"" and 250 pounds. I find myself horrendous although a couple of friends say otherwise but I don't believe them. One of the reasons why I don't is because nobody dares to look at me or strike a conversation with me.  I really want to lose weight and tried multiple times in the past to go running and I also signed up to the gym for a full year and only went three times. I can't seem to do it. I guess I get that feeling that a lot of people might get where you think that everyone is staring at you because you're overweight. I get discouraged easily. To add to all this, I often eat out. Actually I mean that I  always  eat out. I don't have breakfast at home (because I always get up from bed 10 minutes before I have to leave), don't bring lunch to work (because I'm too lazy to make my own lunch the night before and no time in the morning) and usually I go study at cafe's at night so I also have supper outside. Obviously I know this is not good for my body and my wallet and yet, I haven't changed it one bit for the last year or two. 
 Social: 
 Socially, I have 4 best friends that i've know for the last 12 years and one female friend thats incredibly nice with me that i've met not too long ago. That makes me happy but lately, I feel scared to hang around with 3 of them from fear of not knowing what to say. To make it even worse, I feel like im starting to become distant from the last friend I usually hang around with.
I also have issues with talking to other people. I've been told I look too serious whenever im at a coffee shop etc and whenever someone talks to me I can't say anything interesting and it ends up with me wishing the person to leave while having this awkward silence. I hate that. It has become so bad that im even scared to play Dota with another one of my friend via skype because of the fear I have that I won't be interesting enough or have anything to say. 
 Motivation: 
My problem is. I know what to do in order to lose weight etc but I don't do it. I know that if I wake up early and make my lunch/eat breakfast at home it'll be better. And yet I don't do it. I feel like I have no more motivation, no more energy for anything. I study software Engineering and yet I feel useless at programming. I know my stuff but I don't practice enough because when the time comes, I find playing video games or reddit more interesting... As an engineer I think I should be motivated to develop, discover and create stuff and yet I don't. 
 This brings me to my fourth point which is Hobbies. I simply don't have any. I like a bunch of stuff like abandoned buildings, I find them interesting. I like technology (maybe too much) Im always looking at my phone or my screen. I don't know what I can do as a hobby. I keep trying to thing about things to do and I don't know I guess I block at the thought and don't do anything. 
 A real big problem I have is that I know i'm to much in front of my computer. I'm always in front of a screen whether it's my laptop, my phone, the tv (occasionally) and thats it. I tried a couple of times to stop using all of them for a couple of hours and I ended up not doing anything at all. I was unable to come up with something to do and that scared me. I have to say though that in the last year I read over 35 books and i'm actually really proud of that and yet not satisfied. 
 Finally, my family. I really love them all: my sister, my dad and my mom. The problem is that for some reason that I still do not know, I am unable to keep a conversation going with them as well. I have less of a problem with my mom but it's hard for me to talk to my dad. I guess it's because he always and only talked about how I was doing in school. I don't really talk to my sister and never really hugged her except special occasions like new years and christmas. It's hard for me to have physical contact with my parents and tell them I love them. I'm always about to tear up only by thinking of telling them. I love them very much, they are worried about me and I wish I could tell them I love them to set their mind at ease but I don't seem capable of doing so. I recently started trying to hang out with my family more and to talk to my dad but it's pretty hard and it usually doesn't last more than ten minutes. 
 Anyways, that's whats happening currently and was wondering if you guys had any tricks up your magical sleeves of happiness to throw my way.","I feel horribly fat and not doing anything to change it. Diet is horrible ( always eating out) 
 I have a couple of best friends but i'm starting to become scared of chilling with them because I fear not being interesting enough/not talking enough. 
 
 I have no motivation and energy to be the person I used to be. 
 
 I have no hobbies apart from reading 
 
 I love my family but I can't seem to be able to talk to them... 
 
 
 I feel like I shouldn't even be allowed to feel like this. help haha

"Long story, I'll keep it to the pertinent details. 
 Here in Memphis, TN there were (and are) certain bars that two drunken white boys shouldn't make their hang out no matter how sleazy the cougars were or how cheap the beers were.  So we're hanging out with a guy we've befriended, we'll call him Pancho.  Well Pancho is the paterfamilias of this certain establishment and we feel pretty good with him in our corner.  On this night in particular the beer is flowing and the locals are line dancing as if there's no tomorrow. After a while a waitress comes around with a blue plastic bucket full of cash and asks my friend if he'd like to tip the DJ.  My friend responds in his most drunken and belligerent manner and says ""No, I don't want to tip the mutherfucking DJ and if he plays The Electric Slide one more time I'm going to kick his ass.""  It should be known that The Electric Slide is played often in redneck bars in the south so that people can line dance.  Furthermore it should be know that my friend was a skinny, pale ginger standing about 6ft 2 and weighing about 150lbs.  Not exactly the intimidating type. 
 Sooo anyway, a few minutes pass and a guy comes over to our table, leans in and whispers something to Pancho.  Pancho goes white as a Klansman's cowel.   He waves me and my fiend in close and let's us know that Derek (my friend) has just let his mouth write a check his ass couldn't cash.  The waitress has passed Derek's message along to the DJ and has not only offended him, but has vicariously offended his friend(s).  Well the friend who was most offended offered to take care of this ungrateful and insulting non-fan of the music & DJ.  Pancho tells us he knows this guy and he's not a man to be trifled with.  He does us the extra favor of pointing the offended party out across the bar. 
 Camera pans over to the corner of the bar.  I-shit-you-not there stands the biggest man I've ever seen in all my (at the time) 25 years.  He's a mountain of a man, easily 6ft 8 or better.  He has not an ounce of fat on him, he's literally rippling with muscle.  He looks like a stretched out version of Danny Treo, tattoos and all.  He isn't wearing a shirt.  Only pants, a leather biker vest, and fingerless leather gloves.  He's staring a hole through the both of us (mostly Derek) 
 I'm at a loss, not one to back down from a fight even when the odds are down I know that in the best of worlds if we both team up on this guy and somehow win a fight, we'll be paying for it for weeks in bruises and or broken bones if this cat doesn't just pull a knife and leave us both bleeding out on a shitty barroom dance floor.  The best bet is to avoid any confrontation so Pancho tells us, ""just stick with me, he won't start nothin as long as he knows your with us""  Well that's all good and great.  We're stuck between him and the door anyway so there's no slipping out unnoticed and he's still staring my friend down like there's no tomorrow. 
 Time goes buy, we drink a few more beers and eventually Derek has to take a leak.  He tells me he's going to run to the bathroom and be right back.  I sit tight and keep and eye on bikerus giganticus. 
 I take my eye off the biker for a second while distracted by some random skank and what happens?  I can't say for sure, but I'll tell you what happened next. 
 Derek comes running back over to the table.  He's soaked and smells of piss.  I'm WTFing, my friend is vigorously begging me to ""fucking get the hell out of here"" so I bid Pancho goodbye and we head for the door. 
 We get to the truck and I ask Derek WTF is going on as we unceremoniously spin out of the parking lot.  Derek instructs me to go by Krystal's on the way home because he's hungry. He then proceeds to tell me the story of what transpired in the few minutes he was gone to the bathroom. 
 As it turns out he was standing at the urinal pissing as hard and as fast as he could when he felt a presence behind him and looked over his shoulder to see massive biker guy hulking directly over him.  Derek swears the next part of the story is true.  Sensing his eminent death my friend turned in midstream and pissed all over himself and the biker in a move commonly referred to as the helicopter.  This offended the biker so much he turned away in disgust and walked out, at which point my friend pinched it off and ran out of the bathroom, still dripping with piss to get me and GTFO.

"I first saw the program Autodesk Inventor when I was a junior in high school. Immediately, I loved that software. 3D modeling allowed me to build things I could only dream of. Since then, I've continued to teach myself that software. During that time (and even before), I developed an interest in firearms. 
 Now, this is not a maniac or reckless interest, but rather a careful and methodical examination of how these devices work. I don't own a gun (yet). Through pictures, reference material, and advice from shooters, I developed a solid understanding of the parts and functions of various firearms, especially bolt action rifles. 
 When I got an Inventor license, I started ""doodling"" designs. As I learned more, my designs became ever more real. I joined a CAD forum about a year and a half ago to get some models for my own projects (grips, etc). As I started posting there, I got some interest. 
 This first materialized in the form of some freelance work for a guy in England. These jobs were small, such as trigger guards and the like. About a year later (May of this year), I got a similar email from a guy who was starting up a real firearms company and needed some 3D model muscle. I had a phone interview and gave my quote for hours a few days later. 
 Within that day, I found out I had gotten the job. What makes this so monumental is that this design will be produced (it's going through coding and preparation right now). Also a big boost for me is that even though I'm 21 (20 at the time) and not an engineer, I beat out an engineer with 25 years of experience. 
 The guy gave me some detailed guidelines of what he wanted, along with an NDA (hence why I'm being very vague). I completed the project in two weeks, although I underestimated the number of hours needed because the project was very different from what I had done previously. 
 Upon completion, I sent my deliverables and got my pay. 
 What makes this so important to me is that this project is very real and will actually become a physical design. The level of detail on this is orders of magnitude better than anything I've done previously. The guy said he wants to have me work on any future projects he creates. 
 My family was very please to see the final product because they knew how hard I worked. Even my mom, who isn't a gun person, said she wants to see it built. 
 This is a huge boost and will hopefully allow me to get other contracts in the future.","I've been dreaming up and computer modeling guns for years, and now I modeled one that will actually make it to production.",21,M,offmychest

"First time posting here, hopefully someone can help me out. I'm a 20 year old male currently finishing up my first semester of sophomore year in college. Last summer I discovered a small lump on my eyeball, near the back. About [here]( on my left eye. At the time I figured it would go away and forgot about it. Apparently during this time my parents dropped me from their health insurance and ""forgot"" to tell me. Last week I remembered the growth and checked it in the mirror, only to find out that it had near tripled in size. 
 I immediately went in to urgent care, where the doctor referred me to an ophthalmologist. This is where I found out I no longer had any health insurance. I told them to bill me, but I couldn't afford  not  to go see the other doctor so I made an appointment. This was last week. I saw the second doctor yesterday and he basically had no idea what it was.

"27/m, three months ago I broke up with my 24/f girlfriend of a few years. The relationship had simply run its course for me and would not have survived going any farther. She took this amazingly well at the time, I moved out, and we went our separate ways as strong friends. 
 Just days after breaking up, she confirms that she's on the proverbial prowl. This isn't entirely surprising given how her past relationships ended (including the one before ours), so I voice my concerns over this not only for her well-being (rebound relationships are bad for anyone), but my own feelings being hurt too. It felt disrespectful to our recent past to deal with her feelings that way. This doesn't go over well and after many similar conversations, I decided I could no longer be in contact with her if she was going to be doing that. She tells me how I'm ""quitting her"" like everyone else does (she never said anything this bad during our relationship) and, I assume, has either found someone already or is well on her way. 
 I've come to peace with the fact that I won't change her mind and her mistakes are her own no matter how much I want to help. But I suppose my question is whether or not cutting all ties until some point in the future is unreasonable on my part. I'm sure keeping constant contact would have made emotions linger longer than they have this way, but I feel like the friendship will be defunct because of this. I wish I could be there in some supportive way no matter what, especially since she seems to have never felt that from anyone before, but my feelings got in the way of that.

"I wore a watch when I was in grade school (Armitron) and basically stopped until my late twenties when I intermittently started wearing a Mont Blanc automatic with a day/date window.

"One time when I was 15 or 16, I blurted out ""it's starting to rain... This is so gay."" Unfortunately it was right next to my dad's friend from work who is gay and has since become a close family friend. It's probably one of the most avoidable stupid things I've done. We both act as though it never happened, to the point of where it's conceivable that she doesn't even remember or wouldn't unless it was brought up. That, combined with growing up and realizing the insensitivity of using gay as a negative adjective has pretty much cut its use and the word ""faggot"" out of my vernacular.

"Okay, so I'm an American citizen, 15 years old (16 in two months), and I live with my family of Muslims, and we are all expats to Saudi Arabia, because my dad works in the oil business. Expats that work with the company my dad works in ( it's called  Aramco  get all sorts of benefits that Saudi citizens don't, such as the right to own a movie theater, the right to let our women drive (at least in our compound), the right to practice a religion of choice (such as Christianity), and the right to have musical performances (in our compound). The point I am trying to get at is that normal Saudi laws don't apply to me. I'm not going to publicly propagate atheism outside the compound, nor will I do it inside the compound. I have only propagated it to my friends, and online. The punishment for apostasy here is death, so even though there are other atheists and Christians and Bhuddist, etc. etc. living here, I have committed apostasy, which is a whole new level.

I knew instantly I was in trouble because I had a few joints rolled for the concert. I also had one ecstasy pill and one 10mg adderall pill (not perscribed) in my backpack in the car.

Oh yeah and from age 9 through 14 my brother mercilessly beat me. I don't mean like he punched me or anything but would take a mom's whip (not really a whip, more like a specific tree branch - long and narrow - hurts like hell) and just whip me with it when ever I refused to do something he asked. So imagine this. You come home from school (thank God I wasn't bullied in middle school) to find a brother demanding you to be his servant. If you refuse, you got whipped with a wood branch.

 I also remember when my mind got a mind of it's own. It was when I once tried to tell my mom that my brother is beating me when She's not at home. It looked as she didn't listen and just shushed me about it. We were at the bus station waiting for a bus.

"Let me try and remember, I started playing EQ1 after Kunark was released because my dad got me into it. I was about 11 at that point and loved my Wood Elf Druid I had made. I played EQ1 for a long while up through LoY before I stopped and made the switch to EQ2. 
 EQ2 was fun for a while, played it, but all my friends in high school were playing WoW so I switched to that. WoW introduced me to raiding and definitely hurt my social life as I joined a 70% raid attendance guild that raided 3/4 times a week. I became an officer in that guild and got frustrated over something stupid and rage quit WoW and went back to EQ2. 
 Got bored of that quickly after trying Vanguard's beta. I really wanted to like Vanguard, but there just wasn't a player base so I went back to EQ2 again. 
 By this point, epic weapons came out so I knew I needed to have one of those. Got in a guild that I loved, got my conjuror to 80 and raided with him until we had too many. So instead of compete for a raid spot, I leveled an Illusionist to 80 in a few weeks (yay summer vacation). Raided with him for a while but never managed to kill Trakanon. I did manage to get both Epic 2.0's and gear for both my characters though which was fun. 
 I quit that once I went to college as mmo's had hurt my social life in the past. I didn't play a whole bunch of anything besides DoTA clones or battlefield. And then Rift came out. 
 I loved Rift and played it for a while. I got to max level and began raiding again (I never learned that raiding was such a time commitment) and became an officer yet again. I enjoyed it a lot, but by being able to DPS/Support/Heal on my main character, I lost the desire to make alts to do different things. 
 I then played Guild Wars 2 which was awesome until I was 80 for a month. I realized I had absolutely nothing to do besides make my character look barely better. Everything in it was grind for gold to get X. Wasn't my style so I took a break until Rift went F2P. Played it for a month, enjoyed the new content a bunch, but realized I was getting back into the same grind I had been in before. Queue for dungeons, get better gear, raid, get better gear, repeat. 
 That's pretty much my MMO timeline since I played EQ. I tried a lot of others in between like Age of Conan and SWTOR, but never for very long. 
 I can't wait until EQNext comes out because EQ is still the only MMO that has made me feel like I have accomplished something truly significant that isn't just pointless grinding over and over.","Played a lot of MMO's, miss EQ and can't wait til EQNext comes out!",27,M,EQNext

 At home, my grandma was reading through the yearbook and asked what tomato face meant. Embarrassed, I improvised, saying I could make my face red on command. She said ""Do it."" I actually CAN make my face red on command by 'bearing down' and squeezing blood into my head. So I did.

"My wife and I currently have a home under contract, and we're in the period of attorney review. I've been financially stable and have diligently saved for the past 5 years, and I think it's put us in a pretty good position to buy a home. We are tired of pouring money into rent, and we believe we found the right place for us after a year of looking, at a price we think we can afford. 
 I'm 28 years old with 45K in savings for a down payment. We have 10k in emergency savings. I make a 85k salary, and my wife makes approximately 30k (she makes commission, so it fluctuates) which brings us to 115k annually, with a monthly take home of approximately $7,000. I'm fortunate enough to have no debts, but my wife is 70k in the hole with student loans. We are paying all the minimums right now which comes out to $600 a month, and putting what we can spare into the loan with the highest interest rate - all while saving 10% of our take home income and putting 6% for the maximum company match into my 401K. No credit card debt, no car payments. Our rent is currently $1,800. 
 The home we are considering costs $270,000.  We are planning to do 10% down, so after closing costs and perhaps a single premium PMI payment up front (is this recommended?) - we'd have some cash liquid to do some much needed updates to the kitchen, and other smaller projects around the house. 
 A $270,000 home - 10% down payment with a 30 year fixed loan. 4.25% interest. This puts us at an estimate $1,700 monthly payment (mortgage + taxes + home insurance + pmi). 
 So I ran the numbers, and we do pass the [28/36 rule.]( 
 $1,700 home payment  / $7,000 monthly income  = 24% 
 $1,700 + $600(debt) / $7,000 monthly income = 32%

"Hey r/dating, 
 I apologize for the probable wall of text, but I think it would be best to give some context into this situation so I can figure out exactly how to handle this and hopefully/successfully ask this girl out. 
 Little bit of backstory... I'm 20 years old and in college. I just got out of a very long relationship (3+ years) and have finally really come to terms with it after two weeks. I'm not angry or anything, and really am ready to try and ask someone out. 
 Last year I sat next to this girl in a class that I really, really liked. We were both in a relationship and I treated my commitment seriously and it never amounted to anything more than a friendly conversation here or there outside of class. In addition, my ex felt threatened by her and made sure that I didn't run into her for very long because she thought this girl, would try to poach me. 
 I sort of avoided her (not intentionally) from that point on and ran into her here and there. I think the last contact I had with her was grabbing a bite to eat last semester. She is a year ahead of me and we just don't run in the same circles. 
 I feel like she liked me and I really do like her, it just never worked out. In addition, she happened to be roommates with one of my ex's good friends last year and all I heard was how ""crazy"" she was and everything. I don't believe that so much, because the girl it came from is a little difficult for anyone to handle. 
 Okay, so that is the background. I really want to reach out to her and ask her out to eat or something more original (I'm pretty much broke at the moment). But... I'm not quite sure how to do it. I'm pretty sure she broke up with her boyfriend (Facebook says their single and they don't seem to mention one another in anything anymore?). I've only EVER dated my ex and am quite inexperienced. I don't want to fuck this up and this girl is really cool. So, she is currently studying abroad for another week. I am also heading back home next week so it will be a minimum of a week before we are in the same state. 
 In addition, I really don't know what classes she is taking and can't really bump into her intentionally. Should I just wait and see if I can see her again? Or should I reach out to her over text/Facebook? I don't want to be weird and just text her out of the blue, but I also don't want to wait too long and someone else pick her up. 
 Advice? Should I try to contact her next week over text and ask her how her trip went and maybe try to figure it out over text and THEN ask her out when I get back? Or should I try to bump into her on campus and run the risk of not seeing her for a while? 
 In addition, any advice for a cheap first date close to a college campus for a young guy with $7 to his name and no car? 
 Sorry for so much text. I really like this girl and would love to give it a shot, but I want to make sure I don't fuck this up.",Just got out of a 3+ year relationship.

"My mother was 13 when she met my 17yr old father. My mom was raised by the same lady (my great-grandmother) who adopted my grandmother, a very old-fashioned Christian lady who was born in 1917. Well my mother was a rebellious one at her age, and didn't want to be in school, but my great-grandmother (I call her Nana) was not going to allow her to drop out. She felt because she didn't get the education they offer in modern times, my mom should. So my mom, being the manipulative young woman she was, somehow manipulates my Nana into agreeing to allow her to marry my father. My mom was getting into a lot of trouble and refusing to do anything until my nana agreed. 
 So my mom and dad marry, and my mom thinks if she is married, surely she no longer has to go to school. Wrong. My father became responsible for her truancy, so he played the roll of the bad guy as best he could, taking my mom to school, but my mom would skip. My dad ended up in jail for failing to keep her in school, my mom also gets in trouble with the juvenile justice system for not going. The judge ordered that my mom still needed to go to school. 
 So what excuse does my mom cook up next? She gets my dad to knock her up. Surely this would get her out of going to school. Nope. The judge orders she must still attend. So she writes the governor who ends up saying it is unreasonable for her to go to school in her circumstances, pregnant and married at 13. This turned into quite the battle with the state, where it catches national attention. My mom ends up in newspapers, news talk shows all over the country, and for some reason, Woman's Day magazine. 
 My mom gives birth to me in December and is free from schooling. Well, my dad is also fucking crazy and started being abusive to my mom, they cheat on each other, etc, all while we all live with my Nana. This goes on for 3 years when my mom becomes pregnant again with my little brother. Shortly after he's born my mom and dad split up, divorce. My mom gets in trouble, disappears, and My brother and i stay with dad. 
 My dad starts abusing me physically, bruises from beating me mainly, and I am removed from him (just me). I get placed with my Nana. At one point my father actually kidnaps me and takes me to michigan. Eventually he cracks and sends me back to my Nana. 
 My mom turns up finally, pregnant. Then she goes to jail. She's in and out, and keeps getting knocked up. At one point she's thrown in prison for prostitution. I am not allowed contact with my father at this point, which means I didn't get to be around my brother. This goes on for a good portion of my childhood. 
 To sum up my teen years until now, my nana dies and i get put into foster care. My mom ends up with 10 kids, most in states care (she cleaned up eventually and now has two of those kids), when I was 20 I was also pregnant at the same time as her. I get back into touch with my dad/brother. My brother ends up getting killed in a car accident (wear your seat belts, people), and my dad loses his fucking mind, and basically disowns me (I am not good enough).

"Some background info: 
 I've (19M) been with my girlfriend (18F) for about two years now, the relationship has always been good and we've never fought, but I had never really felt strongly in love. 
 I went away for first year university and am now back home for the summer. The gf is super happy that we will be finally spending time together, and I would be too had I not met Jenny (gotta use the reddit classic). 
 Jenny and I met near the end of first year and she is absolutely incredible. We've been going on adventures together, in groups or just us, and I can honestly say its the most fun I've had with anyone in my whole life. 
 This girl makes me want to see the world with her and be spontaneous and live life. I laugh to myself on the bus when I think about how she ties her shoes. Like super crazy gaga romcom type infatuation. 
 I'm a pretty emotionally stable guy so this intense rush of feeling is shaking me up a bit, I really don't know what to do. 
 We live in the same city and have the same group of uni friends and have plans to continue in hanging out during the summer. Its never been awkward because we are both are in relationships (bf of 3yrs), so were obviously both just immediately friendzoned  (right?). 
 Turns out her bf is leaving for the entire summer and they have plans to break up in about a week. 
 I still love my girlfriend of course, but have felt myself slowly getting bored for some time. 
 Do I try to forget about Jenny and stick it out with current gf? Or do I go chasing waterfalls and pursue this new love? 
 The worst part is that I am content in this relationship, and there's no real reason to break up, but I can't get Jenny out of my head. 
 Any advice?",got a taste of honey nut and now plain cheerios just aren't the same.,19,M,relationships
"I was invited, along with the first guy I dated (I was 19, he was 20), over to the house of some people we knew from church. Three generations of their family were there, as well as some miscellaneous people, such as my then-boyfriend and myself. I didn't really know anyone super-well, and I was 1) fairly shy, 2) not really in the same age-range/stage of life as any of the other women there. 
 We hadn't been there very long when it was announced that the playing of a board game was about to commence. I was excited, since I enjoy board games, and I was glad to have a way to pass the time until midnight, since I was feeling awkward just standing around. I went to the table to sit down, and there was not really room for me, so I started looking around for a chair. Suddenly I felt all eyes on me and realized that, for some reason, these people were acting as if I wasn't welcome there. They had already made room for my boyfriend, but nobody was offering me a place to sit, handing me game pieces, etc. 
 ""Uh...can I play?"" I asked timidly. Somehow it came out that it was a tradition for the men to ring in the New Year playing this particular game (I don't even remember what it was). As I am not a man, they would not permit me to play. At first, I thought they were joking. Then I realized they were serious. 
 I tried to be gracious and nonchalantly went into the kitchen to be with the ladies. They were all related, and they were talking amongst themselves and ignored me. I realized that tears were welling up and I couldn't stop them, so I went to the bathroom upstairs and cried for a while. After a few minutes, my boyfriend came to check on me and held me while I cried, and he said we could leave if I wanted to. I did, so we left. 
 He ended up being kind of an immature jerk, and I broke things off with him soon after that, but in that moment, I appreciated that he noticed something was wrong and tried to make it right. Still, I've never before or since felt so blatantly discriminated against for being a woman.","I wasn't allowed to play a board game because I am a woman.

"Ohhh man... where to start 
 I thank you in advance for reading this because it's gonna be long 
 My ndad dated this women for 6 years. I was 10 at the time they met, and for the duration of the relationahip she would accuse me of doing horrible things that were completely untrue. These things included locking kids in closets at parties or throwing a bucket of water in their faces for the fuck of it. Pushing her elderly mother out of the way to get to the bathroom and using her computer to look at porn. 
 The worst part? my dad believed her!!! Every fucking word. I mean, why wouldn't he? I was a kid. And ""kids lie, its what they do!"" 
 I was always grounded. It got to the point where I started to question my own sanity. Why would this women lie like this? Clearly I MUST be doing something wrong. I thought I was losing my mind and blacking out. I was afraid of myself and what I might do... 
 Anyway they broke up and my ndad apologized saying that he shouldn't have believed her and he wouldn't let something like that happen again. 
 So he meets this new woman. They date for two months and then get married (btw he's been married 5 or 6 times). So I'm around 17 at this point. I'll tell you about a few things that happened that really made an impact 
 I told my sister I lost my virginity. She told my mom. My mom called my dad and told him to tell me to take her to planned parenthood (she thought he would be proud.... she also thought it would make him proud that she started teaching me to drive before I had a permit. It didnt). So he tells his wife that i had sex.... and she freaks the fuck out. Theyve been together 4 months at this point 
 She said she's gonna call my gfs mom and tell her what's going on and we aren't allowed to see each other and shit. She's says ""if you're gonna be an adult you're gonna be an adult"" so she tells my dad to stop paying my phone bill and that I have to buy my own food. And he says ""YES DEAR"". Basically at least 
 So now they said I don't have a curfew but the door locks at 12.  That's fair but why can't I have a key? Because she doesn't trust me. (I want to point out that my dad makes a lot of money. I mean A LOT. We had a 4 story house but he sold it to live in her rancher because that's what she wanted) 
 So I pull at at 12:01 and the door is locked. I knock, I call, I open the garage. All locked. No answer. (My dad is out of town). Its fucking January in Pennsylvania. It was cold. I call my dad and he says there's nothing he can do and to sleep in my car. So I did 
 6:00 am i get a text ""you can come in now ;)"" 
 So i wrecked my car in January. A women wasn't using her turn signal and her brake lights were out. I rear ended her at 40 so my car was fucked 
 A week later I get sick and my back starts to hurt. Being the hypochondriac that I am, I think I have meningitis. I call them (at a hockey game) and ask them to bring home a thermometer for me. 
 They said they would. They didn't. 
 I ask my ndad to please go back out because I have to know whether or not I have to go to the hospital.  He leaves to get it and this is the conversation my step mom and i had while he was gone. 
 She says, basically, ""I can't believe you're making your dad go out when you aren't even sick. I'm sick of you doing things for attention because he loves me more. I bet you even crashed your car on purpose"" 
 I say ""don't accuse me of things when you have no idea what's actually going on"" 
 She says ""don't you dare tell me what to do in my own house you worthless piece of shit!"" 
 There it was!!! Proof she was a bitch!!!! My dad kept saying everything else was circumstantial but there was no getting around this! 
 I tell me dad and..... ""stop acting like one"" 
 The worse thing he ever said though, was when my step mom decided, the day I graduated high school, that I could no longer live there. When i asked my dad for help on this he said ""why would I defend you when it could hurt my relationship with her?"" 
 Backing up a bit, when we moved into her house, we moved across school districts. I was a senior and didn't want to change schools. He said ""it would be fine"" and they wouldn't find out 
 Well at the end of the second semester they fucking find out through taxes and of course it's my fault. I must have said something to someone and why would he try to help if ""you dont even like school to begin with"" 
 Im 21 now and have to say that this has had a large impact on my life. My relationships with SO's are bad. For instance, forgiving a girl for cheating? Not really normal behavior. 
 Im sorry for the long post, but for those of you that made it through, thank you. I'm sure there's more but I'm tired and can't think of anything without getting mad",My ndad cares more about his 5th wife than his son,21,M,raisedbynarcissists
"To preface this, I was having a pretty shitty day to start with. It's my 18th cakeday (whoopee!), which wouldn't be so bad, except that it's also the day I happened to be moving to college. I got an hour or so of sleep last night and woke up feeling nauseous. I trudged through, it, nothing I couldn't handle, and managed to get my shit together and out the door. As I was saying my goodbyes to my family, my stomach kicked it up a notch, so I asked my mom for something to relieve the discomfort. She reached into her purse and pulled out a thick round tablet, telling me ""You're supposed to chew it."" 
 I obliged, popping it in my mouth and biting down, and was immediately rewarded with a revolting chalky bitterness. My disgust was evident, especially after I made it loud and clear: ""This tastes AWFUL!"" 
 My mother was unimpressed by my display. ""Oh, quit whining and just chew it up. You'll be fine."" 
 I continued to crunch the unpalatable nastiness, hoping maybe I'd misjudged, or at the very least that it would dissolve quickly. However, much to my surprise and dismay, it only got worse the longer I chewed. Doubt crept into my mind. ""I don't think you're supposed to chew this..."" I managed to swallow most of the foul-tasting pill, but what was left formed a thick paste that clung to the crevices in my teeth, and the intense bitterness was only serving to worsen my nausea. 
 My mom rolled her eyes, but as my expression of disgust only worsened, a thoughtful expression crossed her face, followed immediately by shock and horror. ""I need you to step outside NOW!"" 
 I did as I was told, curious but not concerned, and as soon as the door between her and the rest of the family was shut, she burst into laughter. I was shocked and confused, and only grew more so when she immediately began apologizing. ""I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!"" punctuated by more laughter. She offered me a water bottle, and as I swished the contents around my mouth, she explained herself. ""I just realized... That pill I gave you wasn't a stomach pill..."" more laughter, to the point that she's in tears. ""It was a muscle relaxer!""","My mom gave me what she thought was a chewable anti-nausea tablet, turned out to be a muscle relaxer, I'm headed off to college with this in my system.",18,F,tifu
"I've always been quite a docile person, and spent most of my formative years (until I got to college) with very few social skills. I was very quiet, had few friends, and was just generally socially awkward and anxious. When I got to college, I improved my social skills. I still feel like an introvert at heart, but learned to be more comfortable in social situations and have made a lot of friends. I'm been told that I'm very likeable, that I'm funny, and friendly. My best friend has told me that I am extremely caring, more than anyone else she knows, and that's why she loves me - because I genuinely care a lot about my friends. 
 My problem is this - I care too much, and find that I can be quite submissive, and can sometimes let people take advantage of me without realising it. I tend to sometimes trust people too much, and take more abuse from people than I should - basically I have let people walk all over me if they so choose, and it takes me a long time to even realise that it's happening. 
 Examples: Last year, I fell in love with one of my best friends (we're no longer friends). I told him, and we were with each other several times. He then eventually told me that he hadn't any feelings for me and was only using me for sex when he was horny, because he knew I was in love with him and would do it. I eventually managed to all but shut him out of my life - though I find confrontation extremely difficult and anytime I do see him, I tend to be friendly to avoid any conflict. 
 Last year (partially related to the previous example), I was suffering from depression. I told one of my closest friends and she was not helpful at all, and would avoid any conversations about it. She didn't want to be bummed out by it. After a few months, I gradually started to pull away from her too, but am still friendly and have never confronted her about how that made me feel. 
 Most recently (about a month ago), a guy I had been dating for ~10 months broke up with me. We remained on friendly terms, and he's been quite a good friend to me since the breakup...but I found out the other day that he was leading me on most of the time we were together. He would talk about me to an ex of his in a condescending manner, and was keeping his options open (getting numbers of other guys - though he didn't act on these while we were together). He's made a lot of effort since we broke up to stay friends (w/o benefits, btw), which really confuses me. I'm still undecided on how to handle this.","I[M21] find it difficult to understand and judge other people, and tend to be too trusting. I can be sociable and appear confident to new people.

"Hi everyone. My girlfriend and I have been together for 2 and a half years. I'm 27, she's 26. 
 Here are the facts: Two nights ago I got very, very drunk and wound up kissing another girl at a club. I immediately realized what I had done and left. The next day I admitted to my girlfriend what I had done. She was very upset. We talked about it for about 10 minutes, and then she wanted to be alone. 
 Edit: I should clarify that I was at the club because I was with a friend celebrating another friend's birthday. This girl was a ""friend of a friend of a friend"". I had not met her prior to this night. I never go to clubs. I hate them. 
 Here is why I think it happened: I love my girlfriend very much. We have not been intimate with each other in a couple of months. I often feel that my increasing weight makes me unattractive to her. While at the club this girl was giving me a lot of attention and making me feel great about myself. I think I was attracted to that. In short: my self esteem issues made this possible.

"Hi everyone I got a thing I need advice on. We are all 20ish. The 2 girls are friends and roommates. 
 So I started Uni last week and in Wednesday I was looking for a book in the library when a HB6 approached me, helped me find a book and kinda mutually we went to get a coffee and get to know each other before class. Not a date tho, just 2 people meeting. 
 Until this point everything is cool, a boy and a girl just went to get a coffee and go to class after that. 
 Here is where it gets complicated. 
 Just before class (we all have the same classes) hb6 introduces me to her hb7 friend. The hb7 is my type of gal and I sort of instantly like her but make no moves. So the day ends, no moves happen until yesterday when I meet hb7 alone in class and we talk briefly, she is kinda flirty and I am just playing it cool. After I get home I can't stop thinking about hb7 and I realize she is really hot. 
 I chat up hb7 on Facebook today and just open with school stuff however during the conversation the chat gets mutually more and more flirty, maybe I am a bit more flirting than her. (I use a line where I tell her she should give me private lessons and she says yeah). 
 During the convo with hb7 we mention hb6 for a sec and a minute later hb6 writes to me about some school stuff. I am kinda neutral with her, however she is real flirty. I kinda just close both convos confused.

"My(m34) gf(f25) has only had one job and that was for just a couple of weeks a few years ago before she found out that she was pregnant with her child. (this was long before I was in the picture, so the child is not mine. But side note, I would be very happy to clam her as such.) She lives with her father who support them.  The father of the child(now 2 years old) has no involvement and dose not keep up on child support. 
 When Gf was 9, she was sexually assaulted and no one that she told would believe her.  This has made her very afraid of something happening to her child and she is very careful about who she lets around her kid.  She is also very afraid of leaving her child with someone else for a long time.  She is afraid to put her child in any kind of daycare.  Because of this she dose not have a job. 
 She has told me several times that she feels bad that she dose not have one and that she is not supporting her child.  She also feels bad that it has been her father supporting her and her child.  But her fear of something bad happening to her child still prevents her from getting one. 
 I want to encourage her in getting a job because I think in the long run that it would make her happy to be able to support her child and take that burden off her father, and that it would in general make her feel better about herself.  How can I help her get over her fears enough to be able to leave her child so she can work?  Right now the only one that she is willing to leave her child with is her father and one of her sisters.

"Hello I am a 2nd year Arts student, i don't have many friends but there are people that I can hang out with now and then. 
 My main concern is my best friend and if our relationship is a healthy one or I am just not the good friend I think I am, we know each other for 1 year and few months. We basically have many common things and we share the same interests and humor, we can understand each other and stuff. We are basically best buddies. 
 My friend unfortunately battles with depression and probably other mentall illnesses. She is also suicidal and she is visiting a therapist and she is getting anti-depressants and some pills before she sleeps so she will sleep quietly without nightmares and stuff like that. She generally had a pretty f*cked up childhood. 
 Now before I proceed I want to say that I've done sex with her once but later the same night I told her that it should have not happened and she agreed, I am 100% sure I don't want to be with this girl or friends with benefits, she does not excite me and it was just a night of I-really-want-sex-right-now.
We also live very very close to each other and we can go to each other home's pretty much whatever time we want 
 What's bothering me with my relationship with (let's call her Anna) Anna is that she is too attached to me, she practically asks me to do pretty much anything with her. If she has to go pay some bills or if she wants to go buy something from a store downtown she will ask me to go with her, she never does stuff alone, she always wants me around and she texts me lots of times throughout the day. There's literally never been a day that we have not texted each other and seen each other, even for 5 minutes since many times she runs out of food and she comes over my house to get some. I am kind of sure she would not mind if we were literally 24/7, sleeping together (platonic/ or no platonic way), having lunch together, doing pretty much everything together, the only reason we don't spend so much time together is only because I always find ""excuses"" to not hang out with her ""I am watching a movie i want to see alone"" , ""I am studying"" stuff like that, sometimes I mean them, sometimes I don't.
Even though me and Anna are your typical University students that do not have lots of money, she got me a really expensive mouse for my birthday that she knew I wanted years now, If it have been now I would not have accepted it and I would have told her that it costs too much and i don't want it, that was around 5 months ago. 
 The part where I feel bad is the part that I can see her getting sad when I leave her house after we finish watching a movie. Or when she wants to tell me something (usually weirdish / dark / sad ) but i don't want to hear it (i.e that happened today) because i want to relax. the truth is that she usually asks me if I am up to hear something but if I reply negatively (something like ""hey yeah i do, but i am really tired and I want to sleep) she responds with a sad face and something like ""ah ok :( "" and then she tells me immediately goodnight. She will also get easily ""offended"" and get defensive, i.e I told her that i don't like the word bestie (or something like that), and she got really protective, talking like ""why?...."" , ""you're using it too...but uhm... ok"". 
 Today specifically this conversation happened (more or less) (also the last couple days I am ill) 
 
 Me: hey watch this, it's ace, utubelink , i am going for a shower 
 Her: nice, when you finish the shower txt me because i want to tell you smething 
 (aftershower)Me: so what's up? 
 Her: Nothing in particular, i just wanted to chit chat if you're in the mood
,and then ask you something
so how are you feeling, any less ill? 
 Me: No I am still fricking ill, Basically I will go sleep now because I am tired and ill. 
 Her: aww great :( make a hot cup of tea and eat something 
 
 --Then we just said some irrelevant stuff for 3-4 minutes, she asked me casual stuff without me typing too many things, and at the point I was going to tell her that I am officially going for sleep this happened- 
 
 Her: Okay, can I tell you what I wanted to tell you? 
 Me: uhm, yeah i guess. 
 Her: No? 
 Me: Dude, just tell me. 
 Her: But you're like ""yeah I guess"" , if you're not in the mood for a conversation or you want to go to sleep now we can talk tomorrow, just don't be snob. 
 
 After this message I did not reply to her, I pretended that I slept and after 3-4 hours I send her a message and told her I fell asleep and a goodnight. Now for this particular example I know I shouldn't have replied ""Uhm yeah I guess"" because i was not feeling like ""Uhm yeah I guess"" but I already told her I was going to sleep, why would she ask me for a second time ? This is just one example, there are many many more examples like these that have happened both in chat and in real life. I got drama like this usually 3-4 times per week. 
 There was also a really memorable outburst by her 1 week ago, it was a fantastic day and i had lots of fun with her, as I was about to leave her house she practically hugged the pillow and she would not even speak, made me really angry and uncomfortable, she apologized about it later the same night and she told me she does not know what happened and that she just shut down. It made me think that she really does get somewhat sad every time I am leaving her house / she is leaving my house and it's just not my idea. 
 So what is this? I do believe I am a good human being, friendly and I try to help whoever needs help, I think I've given many many stuff in this relationship, and I've been really good with her (she says that as well), i think i've been ""too"" good with her and now she has somehow got very attached to me and she is getting really sad with every little disconnection I try to make (i.e i did not like the word besties) How should I approach this topic? I do believe she does not see me only as a friend, but every time (2 times) I approached this topic she got really really sad. Generally I tried telling her one more time that I believe we spend wayyy too much together and she got really sad about and said things like ""O I feel like I am tiring you like I am tiring everyone else, and you will go just like all my previous friends"" and it's just hard for me. I am practically her own friend here. Even though I can't hold back and think that even though she is the most supportive person i've ever met alongside with my brother, she does hold me back somehow and she does tire me emotionally.","Best-friend spends way too much with me and she would not mind being with me 24/7, she has lots of insecurities and i don't know how to approach her and tell her that i don't want to spend so much time with me without her getting really sad about it / without me worrying she will do self-harm.",21,M,relationships
"To be clear, I'm not the older guy creeping on the younger girl. We're both freshmen in college (I did the navy thing for 6 years out of high school).

Then some friend commented on it and I promptly answered via facebook too, and she is complaining that I ignored her.. It wasn't really a question, just some random comment like 'Nice! Very funny! blah blah"". If I take 10 minutes to answer a message in gtalk because I was busy, then I hear ""Why didn't you say you would be busy! I've been waiting here and blah blah"". Uncountable times she came and ""broke up"" then 2 days after she just says ""sorry"" and some days later it is all happening again. When my colleagues invite me to play soccer, she complains that I am ""not caring to her"" and that the workmates mean more than her to me... among other things. When I say to her that these are things that we should not be arguing about, she says that se likes these details, that every women is like that, and that if I love her I should put up with it and behave like she wants me to. I am tired of it, I like her, when we are together we have very good times, but ... What should I do?","She is complaining about things that should not be an issue at all, and is driving me crazy.

"Apologies for the impending drudgery, but I kind of just feel like unloading. This one's a bit complicated. 
 I have two housemates, both guys who I hang out with a fair bit. They're still at college while I've recently finished and have started work. Recently I've gotten back in touch with a friend of mine from college, Linda, and we've all been hanging out together with her housemates. 
 A few weeks ago Linda had a house party that I couldn't make it to as I had another event on. At that time, one of my housemates, Barry, hooked up with Linda's housemate, Samantha. 
 Barry's not particularly good with the ladies and never really progressed past the first make-out session, except for an ill-thought out 'date' at a terrible bar that didn't go particularly well. Samantha had told me on a later occasion that it wasn't really working for her, and Barry since 'gave up' when she stopped responding to his messages. He didn't seem particularly cut up about it, though. 
 This is where it gets interesting. Linda's always had a bit of a 'crush' on me (as she called it, she jokes about it quite a bit), but I've never really been particularly interested and would rather just remain friends. I've always ignored the ""hint hints."" 
 The problem arises in that during the time we've all been hanging out, I've been getting on really well with Samantha. I had no intention initially about making a move on her (as I'd be a pretty shit friend if I did, and she'd probably feel the same about Linda), however we do get along really well. As time went on, I felt that she became interested in me as well, however I think we both remained pretty guarded about the whole thing. 
 So a few weeks go by, Barry hasn't made any further moves and doesn't seem to care too much if I try to escalate with Samantha. What also was interesting was that my other housemate, Dickface (not his real name) started making moves on Linda and had gone out on a couple of dates. 
 To attempt an easy transition for Samantha and I, I decided to organise another gathering and try to get alone with her a bit and either ""get drunk and make a move"" (tried and true method) or at the very least ask her out on a one-on-one date in person. 
 With my grand plans in motion, I asked everyone out to a group thing and along they came. 
 Later in the night, Linda went home with one of her other friends because she was tired, leaving myself, Samantha, Dickface and a few other people. 
 During the night, I hadn't had a huge opportunity to isolate Samantha due to where everyone ended up sitting, but we had been chatting and things were going nicely. After Linda left, I finally managed to get a bit of one-on-one time with Samantha. Unfortunately, Dickface is incredibly oblivious to things like leaving your friends alone with girls they're interested in, and particularly in taking hints to do so. Dickface came over and sat on the other side of her and proceeded to talk her ear off the entire time. 
 Any time I'd pipe in to say, well, anything, Dickface would have to jump in and add his two cents. What's even more problematic, is that Dickface is a huge extrovert (no problem in that itself) who loves the sound of his own voice (problem) and won't stop talking. Ever. (Big problem). 
 After giving the oblivious idiot death stares and trying, really trying, to keep Samantha talking to me (which is difficult because nobody in the human race can compare to Dickface in the volume of verbal diarrhoea emitted), after about half an hour I pretty much got to the point of giving up. 
 Dickface and I ended up in the bathroom and I told him to back the fuck off, and he said he would, but never actually did. 
 By this point I was visibly pissed off which was probably my own downfall. I started doing the dickish thing of rummaging through my phone in the naive hope that maybe, just maybe, Dickface will see how bored I am that I can't get a single word in and finally realise that he needs to leave us alone. Of course he didn't, and of course, that was an incredibly stupid thing to do. 
 By the time 4am rode around and I still hadn't had an actual conversation with Samantha, I literally just got up and left in bitterness, defeat and absolute annoyance, when no one was paying attention. Dumb move, I know, and I shouldn't have done it. It seemed to make sense at the time; rather than sit around looking like a pathetic moron, I'd just leave. 
 Samantha sent me a message about half an hour later saying that she was ""sorry she didn't get to say goodbye."" This morning, once I'd slept for a few hours, I responded, essentially saying that I'm an idiot that does stupid things like leaving unnoticed when drunk and tired. 
 I gave Dickface an earful. He was adamant that he ""wasn't trying to make a move,"" which I don't think he was (since he earlier asked Samantha for advice about Linda). Nevertheless, ""I wasn't trying hard enough and should have interjected,"" etc, blah blah. As I had said, I had thought that I had been trying pretty hard to do that, albeit I did give up after a prolonged period of said ear-bashing. 
 It mostly just frustrated me because he knew that I had organised the night in order to progress things with Samantha, and now I kind of feel like I may have missed that window a bit. 
 If she actually responds to my message (we'll see, it's been about 3 hours but that doesn't necessarily mean anything), I'm struggling to work out what to do. I'm sure sure whether this is all karma biting me on the ass since Barry was at one point interested and if I should just leave it be, or to ask her out one-on-one. However, how I left last time didn't leave me in a particularly good position, and I hate asking girls out on the phone and much prefer in-person. 
 I feel like I probably should ask her out (especially since during her advice to Dickface about Linda that he should ""go for it, you'll still be friends if she turns you down,"" blah blah, which seemed pretty applicable to Samantha and I, which she was probably going for), but feel like I'm in a shit position. 
 Sorry for the diatribe, and I understand I probably sound like a fourteen year old with all the over-analysing (I'm actually 24).

"I wanted to thank fittit for profoundly changing my understanding of nutrition, which has changed my life and most likely that of my unborn son's. 
 As back story, I was raised on a very poor diet.  My family had lots of Top Ramen and boxed macaroni and cheese (with hot dogs!) and Dinty Moore, and I never ate a single home-cooked meal.  I remember being allowed soda with breakfast as a child.  As a bonus, I wasn't allowed to play outside, so I grew up fat.  When I was 17 years old, I decided I didn't want to be fat anymore, so I used Slim Fast to cut to 1200 calories a day and started hiking a lot.  I lost 50 lbs/23 kg in six months. 
 Of course, my 1200 calorie diet was mostly Slim Fast shakes and Ramen.  I didn't learn anything positive about nutrition; I just ate a hell of a lot less.  I maintained my weight within about 10 lbs/5 kg for five years, and then I got pregnant, which I took as an excuse to eat anything I liked.  Cue becoming the Goodyear blimp and gaining 10 lbs a  month . 
 Around three months ago, I started reading fittit.  All the talk on here of cutting carbs and increasing fat/protein intake made me wonder what I was actually eating, since I had never paid attention to any part of the nutrition facts label beyond the number of calories.  People were talking about how fitness is 90% diet, when I always thought a calorie was a calorie and it didn't matter what I ate as long as I was at a calorie deficit. 
 I started to realize how much refined sugar and bad carbs I was eating and did a lot of research.  What I learned blew my mind. 
 It has had an insane effect on my diet.  I've always kept a food diary (except for a few months earlier in my pregnancy when I was pigging out with no concern for self-control), so I can compare what I ate yesterday versus a year from yesterday. 
 August 4, 2009 
 
 3 pieces of cake 
 
 1/2 package of Ramen 
 
 1 fried chicken breast 
 
 1 hot dog with bun 
 
 1 ice cream cone 
 
 
 That amounted to roughly 1800 calories, with around 250 grams of carbs (only 2g of which came from fiber).  Keep in mind that's ordered by when I ate the food, too-- I was having cake first thing in the morning.  If I go through my diary entries from last year, it's all like that: no breakfast/lunch/dinner, just cake and cookies and Ramen. 
 Then there's what I ate yesterday. 
 August 4, 2010 
 
 1 cup of oatmeal with honey and blueberries 
 
 Greek yogurt 
 
 1 small quesadilla 
 
 2 bowls of minestrone 
 
 1 serving baked chicken nuggets (my recipe!) 
 
 1 serving sweet potato fries 
 
 1/2 cup low-fat ice cream 
 
 
 That's around 2000 calories.  It's not perfect, and I'm still working to improve, but it's  so  much better that it blows my mind.  I cook everything from scratch, I eat a ton of fiber and much less saturated fat, and I'm even starting to lose my cravings for refined sugar. 
 I've only been eating healthier for three months so far, but I don't foresee ever going back to my previous lifestyle.  What has been learned can never be unlearned.  It's had a positive impact on my husband's diet as well as my own, since he eats whatever I cook, and it means my son won't grow up in a family where Ramen and cookies are the staple.  I just wish I'd figured this out sooner so I wasn't eating such crap (and thereby passing it onto The Creature) early on in my pregnancy. 
 I really look forward to giving birth (kind of) and getting to start weight training, too, so I can reap all the benefits of the knowledge shared on /r/fitness.  (You can probably guess my exercise has always been strictly cardio, no weight training, like many women.)

"Ok... Not a throwaway, but I know one person on Reddit IRL so it isn't a big deal. 
 So, there's this girl, let's call her Savannah. At the beginning of my freshman year in high school, I asked Savannah out. We dated all the way into this summer (the summer of my sophomore year) then we broke up because she said she had experienced the ""taken"" part of high school for 2 years and wanted to see what it was like being single for the other half. I was heartbroken. I was convinced I loved her. 
 Fast forward 2 months. I had moved on. I had found a different, beautiful, funny, smart girl (let's call her Mary). I'd hung out with Mary in a group for awhile now, but never 1-on-1 with her. Yesterday was her 16th birthday. At her party, a mutual friend of ours (her best friend) said I should ask her out, so I did. We're seeing a movie tomorrow night and then volunteering together on another day. 
 Now, the problem: Tonight, Savannah texted me (we're still very good friends and text daily). This text was different, though. This was an ""I miss you and love you"" text. After talking with her for awhile, she said the thing she had with a guy was fading because nobody ""clicked"" with her like she and I did. 
 So here's the issue, if you haven't gotten it from the story already: 
 Savannah is my first love. I've never been as happy in my life as I was with her. I miss being with her. She changed my life. During our time together, we never slept together, but just holding her and being with her changed me... She turned me from the awkward, never-kissed-a-girl, no social life kid I was into someone that people would talk to. I love her. 
 I'm just now starting this thing with Mary, though, and I really really like her. She's beautiful and funny and smart and she and I have so much in common. I want to try new things, but I don't know... Please help me try to figure this out. 
 Please only serious comments. My next date with Mary is tomorrow and I want to figure this out before then... Thanks in advance, y'all.","I'm a 16yo guy and about to be a junior in high school. I dated a girl for a year and a half or more. We broke up. I started going out with another girl. First girl comes back and says she still loves me. What now? 
 Update:  I was talking to Savannah today and she said that while she loves and misses me, she doesn't want a boyfriend right now. I interpreted that as ""Yes, I love you, but I want to try being single right now. Don't go too far, because you're my first choice when I do want another boyfriend.""

"I was lucky enough to get it out of my system early. 
 Freshman year University with a pretty cool girl I had started dating in highschool. We had a pretty great relationship, very open and rational etc. The move to university was tough though - her program was small, intellectually stimulating, and close-knit. I was bumming between 200+ full auditoria and wasn't in res. I didn't really know anyone except my old highschool crowd (Univ. was in same city as Highschool) so I ended up partying with them a fair bit while my gf was socializing with her new program-mates. 
 Result: we didnt see each other much. I mistook it for her avoiding me, she felt like she made major sacrifices spending time with me and not her program whenever we  were  together. Resentment built, and it felt like growing distance. 
 So, over a period of about a month, opportunities arose. I generally ignored them, but came really close to kissing strangers, kissed a highschool girl once (shudder) and -  first worth thing  -  left a party I was at with my girlfriend to hook up with a drunk girl I knew from HS   at a different party.  At the time, my gf was suspicious and I lied, saying this other girl was lost and I was helping. Apparently a mutual friend at the time called me out on it to her, and she vouched for my honour. Ugh.  (<--Second worst thing.) 
 Anyway, I woke up the next day and just sat around the house thinking about what I wanted, feeling awful. I changed my attitude right there, set aside any resentment (as if anything she had done could hold a candle to what I had) and worked on the relationship. Things got  way  better, and we both noticed it too. 
 Like some other people here, around Christmas I confessed to the ""event."" I didn't tell her about the close calls, or the HS girl because the gf knew her. I wanted the relief of confession without blowing the relationship. Dickish.  (<--third worst thing)  The relationship imploded for the holidays, but afterwards she said she forgave me and we got back together. She still doesn't know that there was some emotional cheating leading up to the ""event,"" but I imagine she has guessed. Or someone told her, a distinct possibility knowing my old highschool friend group. 
 She and I have since broken up, I did the single thing: I'm still in touch with my ex, and I value her friendship a great deal. I'm now with an utterly amazing girl who thinks I'm the bee's knees. Hurting her would be like kicking a puppy - impermissible cruelty to unconditional love. I haven't even  considered  cheating on anyone in the five years since, and I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to see my inner asshole. I know what I can do when I drink, and when I don't think my actions through.","Cheated and lied for no good reason, then lied again, then told partial truth. Suffered internally.

"Hello everyone, I'm new to this sub reddit, and to Reddit in general and am very excited to have found this group. I first realized I was into this when I was in high school. My girlfriend and I broke up, and I found out she ended up sleeping with a couple guys from school. In the midst of all the pain I felt initially, it was taken over by getting turned on. I was 16. 
 Now, I'm 25 and more into this than ever. It's become a huge part of my sex life and probably my biggest kink. I LOVE my girl being a slut, flirting with others, watching her fuck other guys, or listening through a door, or over the phone, or her just doing her thing on her own and telling me about it when we're in bed.
This past Thursday, we had the most exciting day of our sex life. We tried getting some people to come over Tuesday night, but we got bailed on twice in a row. I said ""Thursday on my day off, we should just have guy after guy come over and give you the sluttiest day of your life"" She replied with ""Well then I guess you better get started on setting that up now!"" So I did... 
 She trusts me completely. She fucks who I tell her to, and doesn't even require to meet them or know what they look like first. She enjoys being a slut and enjoys doing it for me. So I placed an ad online looking for people.. About 100 emails later, I had a select few phone numbers and pictures and was making arrangements with these guys to come have their way with the girl I love. I had her put on black lingerie and her red lipstick and lay in the bed and be ready for our guest. 
 Guy #1 One guy I've been in touch with for a few months, and he's been dying to get his hands on her. He was the first one. He is a firefighter, built and in extremely good shape.. We agreed I'd watch some, and stay out of the room for some so she could focus on having fun rather than putting on a show, and listening through the door drives me WILD.. Well, I listened through the door and heard some chatter. I heard the sound of movement in the bed, followed by some light moaning from her. They busted out her new toy (a vibrating massager) and I heard the buzzing through the door and her moans got louder. Then I heard him tell her to get up and I heard the sound of him slamming into her. About 20 minutes, some loud moaning later, he came out of the room, thanked me and I thanked him and said we'd do it again sometime... I came into the room, kissed her, and said ""Get dressed. Someone else will be here in about 15 minutes."" 
 Guy#2 He texted me telling me he was here. I let him in, he went into the room and got started. Meanwhile, I switched the laundry over while they got acquainted, and when I came to the room they were naked and he was eating her pussy. He fucked her missionary for a bit, then flipped her over and fucked her doggy. I even recorded it on my phone, from the front watching her ass slam back into him (my favorite view). They finished up and he left. Once again I told her ""Get dressed, the next one will be here in 10 minutes"" 
 Guy#3 He arrived. Had a European accent. Again, I let him in, and he went to town on her. He fucked her FOREVER! I recorded this one as well. With this one, I had her blow me while he fucked her... She couldn't keep my dick in her mouth because he was fucking her for so long she needed to breathe and moan... She was absolutely screaming! He was sweating all over her back and I was hard as a rock. Eventually they finally finished up... She told me she was sore. 
 Guy#4 - Me :) I lubed up her pussy and fucked her twice. I asked her if she loved being a slut for me and if she was enjoying her day. Of course she replied ""Yes"" with a huge smile. My precious slut. 
 Guy #5 This guy is one guy we see every now and then. He buys her undies and lingerie and only cares about her wearing them for him. We met up with him at his hotel room and he had her lingerie ready for her. She wore it and sat on his lap and grinded into him. He took her to the bedroom and I took a picture and recorded it.
Fucked her again when we got home. It was by far the sexiest day of my life and for hers as well. 5 guys in one day. I can't get enough of this... 
 For good measure, I'll throw in some pictures :)

"So yeah, this didn't happen today but actually a few years ago, whatever. You guys know the drill. This has been weighing on my mind ever since it happened in 2010. It remains one of my biggest regrets, and it is something I still wince at the memory of. 
 In 2010, I was 11 years old. I loved video games, as many my age did. I started on the Gamecube and PC, and by 2010 I had moved on up to the Wii. It blew my mind back then, before I got jaded to consoles. But even now, I still consider the Legend of Zelda to be some of the best games ever made. I had played the Gamecube versions of Ocarina of Time and Majoras Mask, and Twilight Princess had become the new object of my fancy. I finally got my hands on a copy, and started playing on my shiny, new Wii. It was amazing, above and beyond all my expectations. The world felt so real, the story so enthralling, the gameplay so exciting. Twilight Princess remains one of my favorite games, even though, as you will see, I never finished it. 
 About halfway through the game, 3 months after I started it, I decided it would be a wonderful idea to show this to my Mom. She and my Dad had always disapproved of games, but I figured that this game was so perfect, it would convince her that they weren't so bad after all. So, partway through the under-water temple, I paused, saved, and went to get my Mom. She received the idea better than I thought, and said she would like to learn about the things that interested me. Alright, off to a good start. 
 As any Zelda fan knows, Twilight Princess has one of the longest, most boring intros in the entire series. Things don't actually get fun until a good hour and a half into the game, and before that it's just a load of random tasks for the villagers. To a Zelda fan such as myself, it was all worth it, but my Mother simply didn't understand. I tried my best to teach her how to play, how to move around and press the right buttons, but she was just uninterested, and I don't blame her. I was kidding myself, thinking that she would get hooked and become a lover of games, having never even played Pac-Man at arcades. 
 After 45 minutes of micro-managing and my Mom running into walls, she had had enough. She tried to tell me politely that she would like to stop. What she said was probably some thing like ""This isn't really my kind of thing, I don't think I want to play anymore"", but what my brain heard was ""I definitely want to play this again, make a new save for me so I can come back to this"". She didn't know how to save, alright, hand me the controller. I went to save her game, went to the first slot, and promptly overwrote my three months of progress with 45 of minutes of Link bumming around the forest. I immediately realized what I had done, and could hardly believe it had happened. My Mother didn't realize anything was wrong, so she left the room as I scrambled towards the T.V. and unplugged everything I could. But it was too late. I turned the Wii back on, and found that I could never get it back. All my progress, 3 months of work, gone. Overwritten because I was just so familiar with the save process that I had forgotten to move down one slot and and save in another profile. I never played Twilight Princess again. I could have gone back and redone my work, but it just seemed so futile. 
 A few years later I got a Playstation, then my own computer. I've played many games since then, but none that captivated me in the same way. I like to think that it's better this way. In my head, I'll never be done with Twilight Princess, one of my favorite games. I'll never have to see a conclusion to Link's story. I'm content to believe that one day, Link saves Hyrule. But for me, that day will never come. For me, Link will always be a hero in his prime.",I ACCIDENTALLY OVERWROTE THREE MONTHS OF PROGRESS IN TWILIGHT PRINCESS WITH A SAVE OF MY MOTHERS GAME THAT SHE NEVER PLAYED AGAIN,11,M,tifu

"My friends and I were enthusiastic skateboarders so naturally we were pretty reckless.  We were crazy into the CKY pranks and stunts so my friends had the great idea of branding the Heartagram into each others flesh.

I felt a slight pinch on my arm followed by three of my friends holding me down and smelt burnt hair and flesh.  Thankfully the daily beating my body would take from bailing down flights of stairs saved me some pain.  They had taken the Heartagram key chain, torched it and branded my arm.

"So I am looking to upgrade my PC since my PC is a bit old now and is showing its age when playing games like dota or counter-strike. My fps is reasonable but my loading times are quite long. My current PC's stats (Which, for reference, was made 5 years ago) is:
-Windows 7 home premium 64 bit
-Intel i5 at 3.4k
-4 gb of ddr3 ram
-Some fairly good ASUS motherboard
-Geforce GT 640 graphics card
-A 1TB Hard drive 
 I would love to be able to tell my parents that I want some good pre-built pc and pay for 1/2 or 1/4 of it(since I'm not old enough to get a job) but my dad is the kind of guy who would want to make a pc and show me how to do it (My current pc we did that) and so it may just be easier to upgrade some parts or make a whole new pc from parts. Currently, I'm disliking how slow loading times are (first load up time on dota, for example, is about a one and a half minutes and after that about 25-35 seconds. Most of my friends load in about 25-35 on their first loadup). So I've had some thoughts about what to upgrade if I'm not able to just get a full new pc, this is what I was thinking:

-Better graphics card since mine is old","I would love to buy a new pc, but I may be able to save some money by just getting some good parts. If I were to get new parts, would it be better to get a separate SSD, Better graphics card, or just build a new pc?",17,M,buildapc
"Hey everyone. I'm 18F and a college student. This post may make me seem immature but as far as relationships go, let's be honest, I'm 18. So yes, I'm a little immature with dating. 
 A few weeks ago, I joined a campus social group for people in my (small-ish) engineering major. I quickly made friends with a few other girls there. They're all sophomores/juniors so they're kind of showing me the ropes I guess. 
 So, one guy (20M) in the group who is acquainted with one of my best friends apparently asked her what my name is, if I'm single, etc. last week. My friend told him, and since she knew I had mentioned that I thought he was really attractive before, she invited him to join our friends to dinner after the meeting. He did, and we all had a great time together. He got my number that night and texted me the next morning. 
 We've been texting all week, talking about everything from engineering to friends to hobbies, etc. He is really fun to talk to, very very smart, and very handsome. Frankly, I'm excited to be talking to him and I really like him. We have also eaten lunch together on campus almost every day last week, sometimes with mine or his friends and sometimes just us. 
 Last weekend, I visited my family. While there, he called me and said that he would like to have a proper date with me, and invited me to dinner and to watch a movie with him (one that I hadn't seen that he has been ragging on me for not seeing for a few days). I agreed and was super excited. We had the date last night since I was out of town over the weekend. 
 We had a fun time at dinner, he offered to pay, and we went back to his dorm to watch the movie. It was fun, and about halfway through the movie he kissed me. I kissed him back, and we made out a few times. Later in the night, he tried escalating it by feeling me up and putting his hands in my pants and such. I stopped him and told him that while I really, really liked him, I'm not super comfortable with sexual stuff this early on. He asked when I would be, and I told him the truth, which is that I'd prefer to go on a few more dates first, and I didn't like to have sex until I was in a relationship with someone. (I didn't tell him this obviously, but I've only had sex with one other guy, and it was a guy I was with for 2 years, so while I enjoy it, I'm just not into sex with someone I'm not dating, which is just a personal preference) He seemed to understand, and went back to just kissing me. The night ended nicely, he dropped me off and gave me a goodnight kiss, and told me he'd text me later. 
 I texted him goodnight last night and he responded the same. So today I asked him (over text) if he would like to hang out again soon. He responded that he would really like to, and that he REALLY likes me, but prefers to date girls who don't make him ""jump through hoops"" (his words) for sex. I asked him what he meant by that, and he said that he was put off by me talking about exclusivity before sex, because he thinks it makes no difference. But it does make a difference to me. 
 So, long post, I'm sorry. But that sums it up. I am thinking I already know the answer to this, but I really like this guy and I just want to hear it from others. So... 
 1) Did I mess up? If he had explained that he had different views on sex, I wouldn't be asking this question, but it was specifically his phrasing that I am making him ""jump through hoops"" which makes me feel like I messed up and am wrong here. 
 2) Are we 100% incompatible due to this? 
 Thanks.","Met an awesome guy who I really like, didn't agree to sexual stuff on the first date. When asked why, I explained I preferred to wait for more exclusivity before taking that step. Now he said that even though he likes me he doesn't want a girl who makes him ""jump through hoops"" for sex. I'm left feeling like I messed up and pretty heartbroken.",18,F,relationships
"To get to the main point of this story, I come from a strict Vietnamese family whose parents are both hard working individuals. They have sacrificed much of their time and health to provide for my younger brother and I in order to secure a better future in Canada. They both do intense labour for a living which my brother and I very much appreciate and try to help out to the best of our ability. However, they are blinded when it comes to our mental needs and are very one-sided. Often, my Nmother would scream at me and threatens me whenever things do not go her way eg. foods to eat, different opinion and perspectives, simple choices like changing internet providers, laundry etc etc. Simply put, we can never have our way with her, project our own voice, and our suggestions mean little to her. Because they are making the money, we have no say in anything which of course has become very detrimental in our decision making skills. 
In Feb/2014, I met my girlfriend on a winter break coming home (Toronto) from studying at my post-grad (London, Ontario) and we connected very well. Despite our long distances, we would often skype each other. My girlfriend is a permanent resident residing in Canada and have just finished her degree. She comes from a wonderful family and have many relatives here in Canada and the States. I have alopecia areata which I patches of bald spots which have truly underminded my confidence and spirit (Because of this condition, it's hard for me to find someone I can open up to or connect with despite having been rejected many times). I have told her about this and she doesn't mind it so long as I am happy. The only problem is that her parents are siblings are living in Vietnam and her wish is to one day sponsor them over. (We are well aware that despite the free health care Canada has, sponsors are financially responsible for their family's health and other accommodations if they are allowed to reside in Canada). 
In the month of May, I made a horrible mistake... Thinking that this issue was small, I decided to introduce my SO to my family only to be ridiculed by my father and nMom. Fearing that my future will be jeopardized if I were to be with this girl, they forced me to break up with her. Why? They fear that this girl is just cheating me to end up marrying her so she can claim her citizenship and so that I can sponsor her parents over. OR, fearing that if we are together one day, it will be a financial burden on me to have to send money home to support her parents. As much as I hated it, I broke up with her because of my parents' demand. We eventually got back together in secret knowing full well that it is my choice to date whoever I want to as it is my life. I can only follow my parent's words and fear and use it cautious. 
I fear that one day, if she and I are still together then how am I going to expose this to my parents? She already knows about my parent's fear and despite all this hardship still wants to continue dating me. I plan to tell my parents when I finish school in two years if we are still together. This is only way as my nmom has already threatened about disowning me and shaming her family. I want to prove to them that my girlfriend is true to me and that we are financially capable of handling ourselves. Slowly, I am introducing her to my cousins and brother so they she can feel accepted. 
I need some advice on how to handle the situation. I'm serious about my relationship but at the same time, I don't want to harm the relationship with my parents. I fear that when it comes out, I will have to pick sides and the stress will only onset and progress my disease even more.",Parents forbid me to date a girl because she has family back home.

"As a senior in high school, I would say what the hell are you doing? Work hard. Pay attention in class, do your homework, and you'll do well. 
My parents always told me to try my best, and I always did. It's not until now, that I've been accepted to every college I've applied to, and been offered multiple scholarships, that I understand why it is SO important to maintain good grades. It seriously makes EVERYTHING so much easier when it comes time to apply for college.

"Just some background info here. 
My wife was “Christian” when we met but not devote. Being a little undereducated and not taking school seriously she never really developed critical thinking skills. I on the other hand dropped out of high school in 9th grade, lived on the streets for a while, got a lucky break and got into college at 16 though a state sponsored program.  This information has been provided to highlight the difference in our upbringing and why our parenting styles are so different. 
 On to the story! 
 Our daughter has always had a fascination with geology and astronomy from a very early age and I have done everything in my power to foster her curiosity and my wife tends to deal more with the emotional side of things. She is 12 now and thinks the concept of a sky wizard to be a bit silly. Her “friends” on the other hand have parents that don’t share our views. 
 A month ago she told me her friends were talking about who loved Jesus more and when it came to her she stated her views, this lead to the start of her being bullied. My wife wanted to rescue her and I wanted to let her skin toughen a little. 
 A week ago random things started to show up on our door like half eaten top roman wedged in between the door frame and the door handle, dead plants, microwaves etc. We also found out our daughter best friend joined the bullies and kicked and punched her at the bus stop (she did fight back) and later that day on the way home from work my wife called me and told me they tried to push our door open to get to her. My wife’s only action taken was to coddle. We had a big fight about how to proceed, I was livid. 
 That’s it! No more. Line was crossed. All of this because my daughter didn’t share in the groups beliefs?! The police were called that night. They visited the homes of the other girls and had talks. The next day my daughter came home crying. She is a tough cookie usually so I asked what was wrong. I guess I kicked the preverbal bees nest. I took the next day off of work. I contacted a lawyer to get options and a little education on the law. 
 Next stop: A meeting with the dean of students and school police officer. My state has pretty harsh penalties for bulling and also makes the school liable for “damages” if they don’t spring into action.  After my meeting I called the districts superintendent’s office for good measure. Fast forward 2 days. 4 out of the 6 girls said they were very sorry and want to be her friend and the other 2 haven’t said a word to her. 
 It’s now been 2 weeks since all of this took place and all seems well. Our daughter is back to her happy curious self. I talked to her last night to see how things are going and asked her if she learned anything. She asked me “Is this how it feels to be a minority?” We chatted about hate, intolerance and its many forms. 
 I personally am not sure if this is a lesson to keep your mouth shut and blend in with the bigoted hoard or more of a reason to fight back. My daughter for her part won’t share that information with anyone anymore because of the scare. It pisses me off a little but I understand how hard school can be. 
 I’m not really looking for advice but more to share a success of using the system for a pleasant outcome. As a parent I never thought that I would be dealing with this. 
 Best of luck to you all!",Daughter spoke about her beliefs and was bullied for it. Dad used clear thinking to do some ass kicking,42,M,atheistparents
"Take a seat, this is going to be a long one. 
 Background: I had been with this girl for 4 and half years. We truly met for the first time the summer before my freshman year (we had played in band in high school, but she wasn't in my circle of friends). She was 2 years younger than me, so she was still in high school. Having already been accepted to a great school very far away, we decided that our we could handle the long distance. I would come home on holidays, breaks, etc. When she graduated high school, we tried to get her into a school near me, but it didn't pan out. We pressed forward. Last Christmas, I asked her to marry me. She agreed. So, 4 and half years together, engaged, and very much in love. That was the status. 
 Since I attend Drexel University, I was in 2 terms of classes followed by 2 terms of coop (aka work). Normally, the plan was for her to come live with me during my work cycle, but it didn't pan out this last cycle. I took a job near me; she took a internship near her. Everything was fine. For anyone who has ever been in a serious long distance relationship, the pain from the distance is almost indescribable, but this girl was my life. Being very broke, I didn't know if I could take off work and fly in to see her. This decision lead to some tension, and it hurt both of us. Finally, one day I said ""Fuck it"". Bought my ticket, gave my boss noticed. I was going to go see her for a week for her birthday. She was super excited, but she was broke too, so she started working 10 hour days, 5 days a week to compensate for the week she was taking off. So, she was super beat every day and I did my best to console her. 
 My flight was on a Saturday, at like 8 am. I was so excited to see her. I was practically dancing my way through the airport. When I landed at my final destination, I was grinning from ear to ear. I pretty much ran from the plane to the waiting area. When I got to her, I almost couldn't contain my happiness. I gave her a big huge and moved to kiss her passionately. Instead, I got the cold kiss, almost lifeless. This action was the first of many to come that crushed my heart. The next action was even better. The first thing to say to the love of your life that you haven't seen in 5 months shouldn't be ""I am on my period."" I was dumbfounded. I was like, okay, but I don't give a shit about that right now, I am just happy to see you. 
 We collect my luggage and start to the car. She asks if it is okay if we head start to her parent's house (her parent's hate me). I say sure, but let's call and tell them right now (they are weird about that kind of thing). She says she already did. Strange I think, she never used her phone while I was here. Whatever, let's go back to your apartment and get you some bags for the weekend. She already had them... As with anything that makes me uncomfortable, I made a joke of it, but we pressed on. 
 Upon arriving at parent's house (2 hours later), we decide to go ahead with the birthday celebration (even though the next day was her birthday). During this time, she is avoiding me like the plague, e.g. going outside to pet the cats, going upstairs to talk to her brother. Generally, she is not being staying near me at all. Little by little, I can feel my heart break more and more. I am not an idiot; I know what this means. I just don't want to believe it. 
 After birthday and dinner and whatnot, we all decide to go to bed (she is tired from her long week). Obviously, I can't sleep in the same bed with her, but I wanted to cuddle and be romantic, etc. She pretty much had no part in that. She just wants to go to sleep. I tuck her into bed, kiss her goodnight, and leave for my bed. I cried as I went to sleep. The pain of her cold heart was almost unbearable. I didn't want to believe it. I didn't want it to be true, but the pain was so real. 
 Upon her waking, she decided we were going back to her apartment. I was perfectly fine with that, haha, but I had made up my mind. I was going to confront her about it. We stopped nearby to get something to drink, and I asked her what was the matter. Why was she being so distant? So cold? She looked me in the eye, removed her fake smile she had been wearing since I arrived, and told me that she thought our relationship was done. With a ring on her and mine finger, we were done. I was devastated (still am, haha). She told me that prior to me coming to see her; she had cheated on me with one of her friends. She was going to pay to fly me back to my apartment, and she is currently together with her new boyfriend. 
 This is probably long enough. I have more details, and the story goes on. But, I think I should stop. Thanks for the read.","Fiance slowly kills will to live, then finishes it by flying me home.",25,M,AskReddit
"Recently met a beautiful, smart, talented 22 year old and originally started out as strictly platonic, friends, and I was totally fine with this, knew it going in no matter what I wanted, being friends was fine with me (voluntary friend zone lol).  Sure I was interested in more, but someone of like minded, geeky, and all around awesome who just wants to hang out is not an issue. 
 We have spent quite a great deal of time together in the past few days, getting to know each other and such.  I knew she had a boyfriend who is in the military and not around for various reasons. She was looking for friends, as was I.  It turns out though that we have feelings for each other that are mutual. 
 She made the first move, it was a small peck on the cheek that I did my best to play off, but later on it went to what would be considered making out (I think? never good with defining the difference between that and extended kissing). Her and I had discussed her situation prior to anything happening and I said I would do my best to respect him and I feel like I failed. 
 I did my best to ignore the advances, some further than just heavy kissing, and while those were fairly successful things got really awkward because I felt really bad and basically had to go. 
 We spoke about it today and I explained that she has a decision to make, she has all the time in the world and I will do my best to be as unbiased as possible and stay out of her way so she can collect her thoughts and such.  I dont want to be 'that guy' but I cant help but want this woman.  It is not even in a sexual way, she is just an amazing person. 
 She explained some things about her current boyfriend that put me off, but they have been dating for a while.  I am doing my best to handle it by simply being as unbiased as possible, even if it means digging my own grave in the relationship (or whatever it is...). 
 I am looking to see what else I should be doing here and if what I am doing is even the right thing to do.  I figure just give her some space, let her collect her thoughts and hope for the best.  I figure trying to skew her decisions one way or another tip the scales unfairly is simply not right nor fair, but I cant help but want to do it as I fell hard for this woman. From what I know about her she is a great girl, many unique qualities and a work ethic and drive for success that would rival some of the best business owners that I know. I know she immediately felt terrible for what happened and I do as well, I feel like I failed to hold my defenses up, but then I realize that it is really not my job to do that, so I am a bit conflicted. 
 Any advice on how to continue?  Just give her some space? Should I go and show that I am the better man?  Or should I just avoid at all costs (not really a realistic option in my head, but it is an option).  I feel like somehow doing anything other than just talking normally is not fair to the boyfriend, but at what point is that not my problem?","Taken girl, things got a bit further than I expected, time for her to choose between me and her current bf that has a couple of problems, what should I do?

"I spent like 5 minutes trying to pick a post title, then said screw it. 
 Ok, so I've only been keto this time for about two weeks. I have dropped 13.6 pounds, and I am thrilled! I am currently 323 pounds, so I know I will lose weight more rapidly at first. I am ecstatic to be losing weight and to be so dedicated to keto. It is becoming easier and easier everyday, and I feel good doing it. I don't have an exercise regimen at the moment, but I hope to change that soon. 
 While I am happy to be losing weight so rapidly, I am worried about people asking about my weight loss. My sisters are very supportive of my ""low carb"" regimen (I haven't explained full keto to them). Yesterday, my oldest sister asked how my weight loss was going, and it felt amazing to tell her I'd lost over 10 pounds. She didn't say anything except ""I'm so proud of you."" That was a relief, I was expecting to hear something like ""Aren't you losing a little too quickly?"" 
 Now, my sister has given me no real reason to be worried she would react like that. I have just discovered that I am worried that if/when someone notices my weight loss, and asks me about it, they may start ""It's not healthy to lose that much weight so quickly."" I even disabled my automatic news feed on MFP (EmilyRegans) for weigh ins so people would not start making negative comments about it. I weigh in daily, but I don't want people to start thinking I'm starving myself or something. I like the encouragement when people comment, but I am not wanting to deal with the negative comments. I have some friends on there who do low cal/low fat.  I don't feel comfortable really talking to anyone about keto because of the stigma that comes with it, and because I'm afraid I will fail. I hate being the 300+ pound girl who is always dieting but never producing results. 
 I'm very heavy, so I know it will take a good chunk of weight loss before anyone will notice, so maybe I won't have to face this situation for some time. I feel like this fear is irrational. Normally, I would just say ""Screw you! I'm doing what works for me!"" , but weight loss is just such a sensitive topic for me. Sorry for the rant, I don't usually post my own thread, but this community is so helpful and inspiring I felt like I could talk to you all about it.

She said yes and told me she could prove it and to follow her. We went to a blind spot on the playground hidden by some overgrown bushes and she told me to close my eyes. I did and she pulled my face down and kissed me on the lips. I melted. I opened my eyes and she was red faced and giggling, she asked me if I liked it.

"Hi all - long time Redditor but first time on a throwaway. I was sent to R/deadbedrooms by the guys over at R/Sex, and I'm looking for some insights in to my situation. 
 I'm 29/M, my GF is 25. We've been together for 5.5 years, we live together, and are engaged. Other than the sexual side of things I would say we have a very fulfilling relationship. We have a very similar outlook on life; we share the same set of friends, we have a lot of fun, we have the same approach to starting a family one day. 
 However throughout the five years I've struggled with the fact that she has a sex drive which is close to zero. I ALWAYS have to initiate. When we do have sex, it's treated as a 'favor' to me, like it's something she does just to stop me humping the sofa. Vanilla sex is the order of the day. There's no variety, or spontaneity, ever. Last night for example, I made a pass at her while we were loading the dishwasher, but just got batted away and fobbed off. The only time anything ever happens is in the bedroom, and my advances are greeted with reluctance by her, a sort of ""oh it's that time again"" mentality. When we do have sex, it's like she's waiting for it to be over, and I do all the work (which makes me feel like some predator just getting his rocks off, rather than that we are making love to each other). We can go weeks or even a month without sex, until I inevitably initiate it just to get some form of release. This all makes me very unhappy. 
 I appreciate my situation may seem 'mild' at present compared to many of the cases on this subreddit, but I'm really worried that I'm walking the same path to isolation & loneliness? 
 I've carried on the relationship because - aside from her untidiness - things are otherwise good. But in my mind, I've always had this voice which says; 
 ""If we have this little sex now, how will she be after children?""
""If sex is so lacking in our twenties, how will we stay strong through our 30's, 40's and onwards?""
""I've been faithful this long, but am I just delaying the inevitable because I'm only human?"" 
 My girlfriend is such a good person, and I do love her, but a sexless future terrifies me. But so too does the idea of breaking up with her (I feel like it would entirely destroy her life).  I should add, she's always had a low sex drive, I just overlooked this earlier in the relationship because I was pleased to be in one which seemed so healthy (my previous one was pretty sucky in a great many ways), so she seemed like a breath of fresh air. 
 The thing that has brought this to a head for me, is that an old friend of mine has recently come back in to my life. She and I have always felt a connection but we never acted on it due to one or both of us being in relationships at the time. If I'm honest I stayed clear of her the last five years because of how she made me feel. Her 6 year relationship has now come to an end though and we started talking again recently and have been really hitting it off. 
 I'm not proud of this but, but I met up with her at the weekend and we spent the night together. It wasn't full penetrative sex, but everything else happened you might expect. And most importantly, she was enthusiastic and receptive towards me! The passion was incredible, and I haven't felt this way in so long. I know this girl would like a relationship with me. She's a fantastic person and I think we'd do well together, but I can't get over what a bastard I'm being to my girlfriend. 
 Anyone who has taken the time to read this and in particular respond, I am grateful on a level I'm unable to express, as this is really weighing on me. 
 Thanks x","29/m in sexually tepid but otherwise good relationship, looking for advice from those who may have already walked the path I'm on. I'd prefer you not respond if you haven't read the full thing though please! :) 
 Edit Is there anyone who went through my particular set of circumstances, e.g. coped with a partners low (not just absent) sex drive for a long time before marriage, and had to make a decision one way or another?

"25/M here planning my first solo trip to Europe from May 13 – June 18!  I plan on staying in hostels the whole time and I’m sure I’ll meet a ton of people so I'm super excited about that aspect.  I'm planning on bringing a journal and having people I meet sign it/write something witty or inspirational as a memoir.  I also got one of those 'wreck it' journals which has you do a bunch of random spontaneous things to spice up your travels. I’m planning on doing a few touristy things but mostly trying to absorb the culture and find those hidden gems that all the locals know about, as well as finding all kinds of physical activities and adventures.  My current itinerary is flexible but I have a rough outline of the countries I want to visit, and the times I will be there. 
 
 [5/14-5/21] Spain – Madrid and Barcelona 
 [5/21-5/26] Italy – Florence, Venice  
 [5/26-5/30] Switzerland – Lucerne, Grimmelwald, Lauterbrunnen 
 [5/31-6/3] Germany - Munich  
 [6/3-6/7] Hungary – Budapest 
 [6/8-6/11] Czech – Prague 
 [6/11-6/14] Germany - Berlin 
 [6/15-6/18] Netherlands - Amsterdam 
 
 First question, does this seem doable? 
I am not really worried about budget too much- willing to spend a little extra on hostels by not booking in advance, and plan on using the Rome2Rio app for travelling country to country. Also looking for which stops along the way that would be a sin to miss. 
 Any tips or suggestions on things NOT to miss in any of the countries above would be HUGELY appreciated! 
 Interests : 
Food: I'm a huge Anthony Bourdain fan and as long as the food is good, it doesn't matter if it's super expensive or came from a street cart. Finding that place that does one dish really well is amazing! 
Activities:  I'm looking to do a few 'touristy' things, but mostly want to wander around, enjoy culture, nature, outdoor activities, and experience the nightlife on occasion. 
 Overall, I'm a little anxious as this will be my first time out of the country AND solo-travelling but I'm hoping ill get accustomed and fit in after the first few days.  I’m very easy going, laidback, and love living in the moment, taking everything in so I think it should be fairly easy to make friends. 
 Lastly, a question regarding SIM cards... is it better to get one here before I leave? Can I get one once I arrive and use it in multiple countries, or do I need to get a different SIM card in each country? 
 Apologies for the lengthy post, but I wanted to make sure I covered everything - I'm sure ill forget something as is..Thanks in advance and please let me know if you have any questions!!!","first solo-traveling experience to Eastern/Central Europe for 5 weeks with no strict schedule - looking for tips, advice, suggestions on places to see and things to do!

"f/33 which makes me ancient I know.  Met a guy online, had a great first date. Second date was a little less than great and I ended up canceling our third date. 
 I had a list of stupid reasons why, none of them important, and in retrospect I really didn't give him a chance.  I just bailed I think bc it had potential of turning into something real and I think that scares me.

 I emailed him and texted him a few times but he won't respond at all.  He won't write back to tell me to stop contacting him but also won't answer when my multiple requests to hang out or to talk.

"So I was thinking back to my first obe and it was for sure linked to smoking. I thought I'd share this story and see if its common. It was a accurence that kinda change my life and led to a whole new outlook on everythingso no haters please. 
 So being a 18 year old in southern  California well say cannabis was not hard to come by especially in 2011. Most of my friends had been smoking for some time and I was a little reserved till around 18 as far as smoking/drinking goes. So I had only smoked maybe 2 times before the incident. So here I was in a garage in socal in the dead of summer. It was a empty garage all white nothing in there except two plastic chairs and a bong. We begin smoking, and it being my 3rd time I decided ""its never been to intense I can match hits."". Around the 8th snap I drop the bong and somewhat pass out apparently. At first its dark and I can't really recall anything. I begin seeing cartoonish figires and feel a very intense vibrating feeling throughout my body. Soon I'm snapped to by my friend. And in the pattern of the vibrations my friend was saying my name repeatedly. Which tripped me out more. 
I awoke to a cartoonish world... Now the vibrations got more violent and with the pattern of his repeating voice. I assumed I was stuck in this moment in time... I know tried to leave the house thinking I'd break this time loop I thought I was in. I ran for the door. My friend grabbed me and got me to the ground to calm me down. As I hit the floor tho... I'm suddenly above him and I. He moved me to the garage... My ""astral body"" was watching. I barely got to move around in this form before I jerked back to the garage, back to the physical. 
After this some funny stuff accured but is unrelated to the spiritual side, well just say I was freaked out in a cartoonish claymation style world... I assumed I was stuck in some strange world still (and no it wasn't laced my friend was completly normal). Now this lasted till around 4 pm. We smoked at around 10am. Now I'm back to normal after a 6 hour weed induced adventure. I go home and everything's fine till I lay down. The vibrations began again and became more violent to the point of uncomfort. I'd get up drink some water and it go away. This continued throughout the night. I would eventually fall asleep and then sometimes my mind would be awake and my body still asleep. This continued for several weeks before I found a website explaining astral projection and how the vibrations is the soul separating. This led to a acceptance of it and I began to practice meditation and ap. It led to me basically questioning everything.. Helped me stumble upon spirit science, Joe organ podcast, Alex grey, Terence mckenna , Alan watts, and more. So I'm happy it happened but was terrifying when I was unaware of what was occurring. 
 P.s since I stopped smoking I can't astral project nearly as easy. But I can't smoke now that I got a big boy job...","got way to high, thought I was stuck in time loop, had obe, and then every night I experienced vibrations, which led to learning spirit science.",18,M,spiritscience
"Body: I've suffered with disordered eating on and off over my life (and if I'm honest the off times are far less than the on). I started dieting at seven and don't remember a day in my life when I haven't loathed the sight of myself. I'm 27 and I've come so far to be where I am. I thought I was doing so well but lately... not so much. 
 I sought help and worked really hard especially for the last year to not focus on losing weight, but on learning to eat better and being healthy. I am with a wonderful man that adores me and despite my flaws finds me sexy and tells me often. 
 I battled through parts of last year with restriction and bulimia but I always managed to work my way through it and refocus my negative thinking. The thing is, I live with my sister and she is away for three weeks. Since she's been gone I've found myself falling into old habits. Barely eating and when I do I vomit it straight back up. What scares me the most is that instead of being concerned I feel powerful and proud of myself. I want to stop but I also don't and I want with all my heart to just give in and fall back and rest on my ED that has been a part of me since forever. 
 I want to be strong, I want a healthy body that I can be proud of. A body I can look at without wanting to burst into hysterical tears. A body that can bear children. And when that time eventually comes, I want a mind that will not pass on any poison to them. 
 I can't afford to see anyone. I can't afford private health I am a student with a tonne of debt and that won't change for years to come.

"Edit: He's 22, not 23. Mistyped it. 
 Background:  I have been dating my boyfriend for 5 months now. I was raped two months before we met (completely separate incident, neither of us know the attacker) and I was still in the process of getting tested for STDs and seeking counseling when we met. We instantly hit it off and began dating. I told him before we started dating that the attack really shook me, and he was very supportive of it. He knows that I've met people who've said some really shitty things about me regarding this (ie: ""so I guess you're tainted meat"" & other things along those lines), so he knows that I find them both distasteful and hurtful. We did have a few incidents where his younger brother and best friend made rape jokes in skype, but after letting them know the situation, they were very understanding of it and didn't do so again. His family is aware of the situation and there haven't been any issues over it. 
 Today:  I was watching the C9 vs TSM finals on Skype with him and his brother, and there was light banter because we support different teams. It was really lighthearted and everyone was having a good time... and my then boyfriend makes this joke after finding it on an AskReddit thread: ""Q: What's the difference between Isaac Newton and the baby I just stabbed to death? A: Isaac Newton died a virgin."" I am shocked. I know it's just a stupid joke. I know it was read off an askreddit thread. BUT there are two things that makes this (in my mind) not acceptable. 
 1) His brother was the one who found it, and linked it to him  in private skype chat  because he knew that I wouldn't like it. I don't have a problem with that. He then read it out loud while I was in the middle of asking ""what's the premise of the joke? If it's not something you think I'd like, you should probably just giggle over it between yourselves"". Of course, I never got to the second part of the statement. 
2) We had previously had not a few, but MANY conversations where we talked about how I was NOT comfortable with jokes about rape. This is NOT the first time that he's made references like this (about rape in general and about my particular rape) and he knew better. The fact that he didn't use his better judgement about this ONE subject that I'm not comfortable joking about is astounding to me. 
 Please, /r/relationships. Am I over-reacting? I'm in shock and seething with rage right now, but I do want to re-evaluate this once I have a clearer head. Please tell me what to do.","I was raped recently, boyfriend makes rape joke in Skype call despite us having multiple conversations about how I don't approve of those jokes.

"I've skimmed through the ""getting started"" section, and I think I have my routine down, But I'm not sure if I'm doing it right. I'd like to start off by saying I've never been active, so ANY advice would be appreciated. 
 The F.A.Q said I should provide some background, so here it goes. 
 I'm a typical overweight gamer, playing 8+ hours a day, with little to no physical activity. Recently I decided I wanted to make a difference in my lifestyle and decided I wanted to get fit. 
I bought a kettlebell(25 lb.) and some protein powder (ON Gold Standard to be exact), and have been swinging everyday for 30min for the past week. I've also been trying to do intermittent fasting(16 hour fast) 
 My typical routine everyday is black coffee as soon as I get up, then I drink a protein shake at around noon (8oz of milk + 1 scoop of protein) I wait 30min-1 hour then I do a 30min workout with my kettlebell*. Followed by a shower and I make another protein shake, but this time in the blender I add 1 banana and 1 spoon of peanut butter with the same 8 oz of milk and 1 scoop of protein. I wait till around 7 and I eat dinner, which has been consisting of a chicken breast with brown rice, and on some days when I'm not feeling brown rice I'll just add a heap of portobello mushrooms. I always take a multi-vitamin with dinner. 
 *My kettlebell routine at the moment is: 
 As many pushups as I can manage to warmup.
Then, 
 50 x 2-hand swings. 
 Another set of max pushups

 then I end with a session of 2-hand swings where I try to swing for as long as I can. Max I've been able to do is 60 or so swings.

"Hi there, just looking for some advice. My family relationships feel like they are completely deteriorating and it's getting me really down and depressed. I’m 21, in my final few weeks of finishing off my Software Engineering degree. I’m in the height of stress trying to get my final year project and the thesis due with it done, along with exams. I want to do well grade wise as I’ve landed a really good job in my city that I’m based in for university. I’m really career-proud as it felt like I really belong and can make a difference. I’m totally in love with what I do. 
 To give the backstory: We are farmers. There are four sons, the eldest whom has moved to America (36), Daniel (34), Aidan (30) and myself (21). My father got into bad money problems once the recession hit back in 2007 – and has been dealing with the consequences since. He’s over 2 million euros in debt. The bank stopped dealing with him (between being a difficult man to cope with and the situation itself) and sold his loans to a professional services firm. They are currently getting his debts written off as in exchange for signing everything over to Daniel, who works on the farm full time. 
 Its stressful, having to get out of the property deals he acquired years ago, and be left with just the farm and having to give over 350k to these people/’vulture firm’. I would say that despite all the bad decisions made, we get to keep our land and continue the farm in the family name. My brother is planning to raise the money. He has three kids and a wife, so they will be spending the next few years paying that off, if/once it gets agreed. 
 The whole thing has grappled all of us for years, trying to juggle banks and making payments. I’ve mostly been dependant on my family for getting through college, which I’m really thankful for helping me. Despite the debt, him and Daniel still managed to get me into and through college (isn’t as expensive here as say, America but still). Any communication I have with my brothers or parents usually revolves around money. It pains me. 
 Daniel and my father had a very rocky relationship as a result, the new ideas vs old ways, and the struggles of it resulted in Daniel having a mental breakdown and having been admitted to hospital back in September. He’s a lot better these days, but needs to be aware to take it easy, which can be considered difficult with the lifestyle of dairy farming and these proceedings. My Father is an odd guy; he has been involved with a long term affair which he doesn’t know I know about. 
 I’ve found it very hard to fit in at home, I’ve never liked farming. I’ve always been seen as lazy and good for nothing since I spent all my time on computers. I’ve tried always to be as helpful in whatever way I could, looking after our Mother who suffers from schizophrenia, look after my nephew and nieces, offer feedback, do farm-work where I can. Anything I do feels not good enough. The phrase ‘you’re only as good as you are tomorrow’ is said to me often at home. 
 Despite them supporting me through college, its seen as ‘why are you doing that up there and being down here at home helping’. I’ve been given out to for moving up into the city by Aidan constantly. Where the truth is, I feel like I can’t handle the stress of being as home. It brings me down. But I can understand that he would feel I would need to be in the middle of the burden too. 
 As it turns out, I’m gay and that was tough to deal with and came out when I was 18. For me, it was the best thing I’ve ever done. I came to college as ‘out’. Not making it a big deal, just happens to be a part of who I am, I’ve developed amazing friendships and a real sense of family and community, which I never felt like I had with home. I feel like I belong in the life that I developed for myself. I’m so happy and proud of it. 
 Between all of us in the family, we find it very hard to communicate. My relationship with Aidan is particularly bad and is what has prompted me to write this post. He’s always been hard on me and most encounters have been very one sided conversations where I’m treated like a child. I don’t think he sees much more than a stupid idiot who only cares about himself. Everything I do comes across as manipulative to him. He thinks I constantly party and have sex with numerous men, which I do neither of. I’m too busy, and I rarely drink, I never do drugs or smoke. I just want to build a good life for myself. But I’m reminded how disgusting my lifestyle is. 
 Aidan makes me not want to go home to see anyone. He hates me, he sees me as selfish. Maybe I am, I don’t know. I don’t know what I can do to make him happy. I wish I could help more with the money situation. I still feel like I can see where he comes from, he makes me feel so little and what worse a part of me agrees that maybe I am manipulative and good for nothing. It could be seen that any money I look for is just to get ahead for myself and not have any regard anyone else. 
 What broke the straw for Aidan was when I shared my Summer plans. I got a loan out of 5000 euro to go travelling this summer before I start work. A chance to get away, to recover from the burning out I’m going through with college now. I also wanted to not have to request any more money off the farm, enough money to last me through from April to September of this year. 
 I thought it would be ok as I start my job in August with a salary of 50,000 with plans to pay it straight off. The annoying thing is that the bank requires payments immediately instead of delaying it until September which I had tried and begged them for. I asked my Dad and he said it would be OK to set up a standing order from his account as long as I pay it back. I have no problem and plan to pay him back the 900 euro as soon as I start working. I thought this would be ok. But when Aidan heard, he went absolutely crazy. He sent me a massive message on WhatsApp at 01:30 disowning me. Saying I have no regard for Daniel and all he is going through and to never talk to him again. 
 Am I in the wrong here? A part of me is really fed up the abuse I’m receiving and how all Aidan’s opinion of me is spreading where I’ve heard through the grapevine that Aidan’s wife, Daniel’s wife (who in particular I’m close with) have also disowned me. I feel so isolated that I should properly prepare to venture on my own and keep away from them, that I’ll be better staying away from them since I seem to be only ‘in it’ for myself. I don’t want that; I want everyone to be happy. I want us all to get along but I don’t know what I can do to do that. 
 I’d really appreciate some third party advice as its getting me so down.","Brother sees me as a shitty person for attempting to develop my own life while long-term family crisis continues, unsure if this is wrong. Am I a bad brother and what can I do do?",21,M,relationships
"So, my story is a bit of a shitty one, bear with me please! I'm an 18 year old guy who is about 171cm (5ft 7in?)  and used to weigh 61kg (130 lbs??). I wasn't in terrible shape, I've never been on the heavier side, actually I've always had trouble gaining weight all my life, but I was pretty happy with my body how it was I worked out occasionally and such, and I lived a regular life for a guy my age so I drank and smoked some times. Anyways, about a month and half ago I was diagnosed with henoch-schonlein purpura which ended up in me getting a rash all over my legs and arms and they got incredibly inflamed (couldn't walk or grab things), then it caused an  awful abdominal pain, which ended up in me taking a lot of painkillers which only made things a lot worse, because it caused me a severe gastritis and some bleeding in my stomach, also I had an inflamed colon (no idea why, maybe the purpura). After the pain was way too bad, I went to the hospital, and a month later I was free, but I lost essentially all of my mass, I haven't weighed myself because I'm scared, but by simply looking in the mirror I could see my bones sticking out, especially my legs.

"So, this was  years  ago. I was 14-15 and at the time thought I liked boys, and I was with this nice enough bro. We had been dating for like 5 months. 
 My dad's more Catholic than the Pope, and had forbade me from dating anyone until I was 16. I was his youngest daughter, and he was particularly protective of me. 
 But I was 14, and thought I was in love 4everz, and so I had kept my boyfriend a secret. After a few months, I started to indulge my boyfriend with handjobs. And this worked for a while. 
 That is, until one fateful afternoon, where I was with my boyfriend for like three hours (and I had insisted it was for afterschool things). We had decided to slink off, something we became accustomed to doing, and we started off making all sorts of jokes. And then I got him off, and we both were next to each other. 
 And I heard crinkling. My boyfriend and I looked at each other, confused. He checked his phone, and I found mine. 
 My dad was on the line, asking for me. 
 I couldn't muster words. I hung up, and inhaled deeply, almost feeling the talons of cruel death descend upon my soul. I look at my boyfriend, the color drained out of my face, and I tell him- ""I'm fucked."" 
 We had made the march of shame back to the front office, color still not returning to my face, and I had him stay back, because my school's office had windows facing the carpool lane. 
 ""If you don't hear from me, you know what happened,"" I said, my voice trembling, as I had to swallow my pride and all of his crushed respect of me in one gulp, and I approached his car, and sat in the front seat. 
 I could  feel  his rage. 
 ""So, uh..."" 
 ""I know what you've been doing,"" he growled, looking at me with pointed disgust. 
 ""Yeah, I know,"" I replied, crestfallen. 
 ""Do you want to know  when  in your darling conversation that your phone decided to let me listen in?"" 
 ""Uh, not really."" 
 ""Oh, it was when he fancied you could be a good  DICK DOCTOR ."" 
 And so ensued the most awkward fucking discussion of my life. 
 To bring it to today, my dad told me a year ago that he still would recognize his voice in any public venue. And I broke up with the guy, later realized that I'm actually into women, and I'm disowned because I'm into women. But damn I was glad when they moved to Florida, because I was genuinely worried that my dad would pick up my ex-boyfriend and beat the ever-loving shit out of him while he was working at the local McDonald's.","My younger self was a little shit and decided to have a boyfriend despite military father's insistence that I should wait until I was older.

"I (24.f) with boyfriend (23.m) of two years seem to be avoiding the inevitable, I feel like I should let go but don't want to. 
 Basically, I always told myself that me asking this subreddit means that things are pretty bad. 
 I am madly in love with my boyfriend.  He never exactly was the nicest guy in the world: the beginning of our relationship was very rough on me.  I felt like he didn't like me very much but I guess it was the first time I actually experienced being in love.  The relationships I had before did not compare at all to what I felt with this guy (even my four year relationship prior to this). 
 My boyfriend seems to be emotionally selfish.  As in, he needs me to baby him, make him feel good, and kiss him non stop.  I am fine with that, in fact, I love it...but I DO have my days where I am stressed or bummed (who doesn't?) and right away he starts saying that I don't care for him. 
 I'm not the only one that notices this, he is a 6'4 234 pound man.  He is massive and he expects me to show him affection in public, whether he is sick, at the gym, or simply just walking with me.  I have to hold his hand. 
 I normally would not care about this, but it seems as if every time I have a hard time and need my own emotional support--he fails.  I miscarried a few months ago and instead, every time I would talk about it he will kind of say ""it'll be okay"" and just go back to doing what he's doing. 
 My uncle is in the hospital for a heart attack in the ICU.  My mother has dealt with a lot of loss in the last year and has a history of severe depression, so I am obviously stressed about things.  He came to the hospital with me and was fine...the minute we get home I express how I felt and he cut me half way through and said ""ENOUGH! Quit being so negative!""  OKAY, this is where I MESSED up but I got really mad and stormed to the other room.  He flipped on me for ignoring him so then we had a heated argument where he said that I shouldn't take issues out on him.  HE IS RIGHT, I SHOULDN'T.  But I should get a damn pass, I'm freaking out here.  So the rest of the night was about HIM and how HE felt and disregards how possibly this situation weighs on me (my mother lost her father, mother, brother, and then this...she's had way too many blows). 
 I started crying bad all night and he came to the room, only after I told him how miserable I felt.  He slept with me but again has been cold all day. I know he has anger issues but I really don't know if this sort of thing is right for me.  Don't get me wrong: he does EVERYTHING he can to please me: takes me out to places I love, he tells me he loves me, he holds me, and most importantly is affectionate whenever these bad things aren't happening.  But I feel like I need him right now, I can't deal with seeing my mom the way she got when we were kids (she didn't recognize us and my dad had to raise us due to her severe mental state). 
 I don't know Reddit.  Today, he tried being nice and talking to me about things.  I told him I thought he was immature/selfish emotionally and that even people outside are starting to see it (if I am at work and need to get off the phone, he will say 'I love you' and if I don't say it how he wants me to...he thinks something is wrong). 
 I love him but I feel like he, to be honest, will always find something wrong with our relationship.  I just feel like he doesn't treat me like he wants to be treated.  If he has a bad day, I understand if he get snappy...IT HAPPENS.  If he is sad, I understand.  If he doesn't feel like having sex (I don't always feel up to it--but sheesh--I do try to get in the mood because I love intimate moments with him!), I understand.  If he says something out of line, I blame it on the heat of the moment and move on. 
 However, if I reject sex, he gets sad and angry.  If I'm having a bad day, I have to pretend it's all fine and talk about something else.  If I cross the line in an argument: he blows up. 
 I know this all makes him sound like a major dickwad but he sincerely does a lot for me......but what the hell? Why can't things be moderate or fair? 
 Whenever we talk about the future: he goes from hot to cold.  If he feels loved that day: he talks about our future, buying a house.....nice and reassuring stuff.  Whenever he doesn't feel like I've been loving: we will see, can't go to LA (I'm flying out for the holidays, I wanted him to come out) because he doesn't know if things will be okay.... 
 I love him so much...but what do I do? We scheduled counseling for next Monday but am I doomed with a person that will forever be like this? Will he grow out of it? Will he learn to process MY feelings like I process HIS?  Today, when we talked about all these issues he just comes to the room and asks, ""What do you want for Christmas?""  Kind of hit me hard.  He has an heirloom engagement ring he wanted to give me but we were going to have it redesigned to something we liked....I told him awhile ago that for Christmas I would like to get my ring process designed....so it felt bad that he asked that.  Almost as if I am just a temporary girlfriend or something since he just doesn't seem to know what he wants......what do I do?","I (24.f) with boyfriend (23.m) of two years seem to be avoiding the inevitable, I feel like I should let go but don't want to--even though he's emotionally selfish.",24,F,relationships

"So this is a new/first account because I am at a crossroads here and have no clue where to go. 
 Background 
I am 23f and he is 37m. We have been dating for 4 years. I met him (as my manager) when I got my first job out of high school while doing some community college work. I dated someone else for a year but after breaking up this guy was there for me and after a few months we decided to give it a try. I told him I didn't care about the age difference at that point in the relationship and honestly I haven't really given it much of a second thought since then. 
 I graduated and got accepted to a big state school 4 hours away. I gave him the option of breaking off the relationship but we agreed to go ahead and give it a try. 3 years later and I have graduated with my Bachelors and he was there for me every step of the way. We saw each other for a few days about once every 2 months during this time. 
 I recently moved back home with my parents as I will be going back to school for another 2 years to get my license to practice as a vet technician. Unfortunately the jobs available in my area are limited and as such I have been forced to go back to work with my boyfriend to keep bills paid until I can find something else. This is stressing the relationship as we differ greatly on the topic of work environments, but must be very careful to avoid other employees calling out special treatment etc. 
 The other thing that is stressing the relationship is mental and physical health. My boyfriend is always, and I mean always, sick. Colds, migraines, stomach problems, you name it. It is emotionally draining to deal with. In addition he was diagnosed as bipolar a few years back and is on medication. His life habits are poor (smoking/watching TV for hrs at night) and due to his schedule he sleeps until 2/3pm in the afternoon then gets up and goes to work, repeat everyday. He is extremely unmotivated and really has no idea what it is that he wants to do as a job, but he knows he isn't happy with his position now, especially with the pay (about 25,000/yr). I have tried to suggest additional schooling as he has his GED and dropped out of community college. No go as of yet. 
 Another problem is his debt. He has about 1700 in credit card debt. His spending habits are horrible and it is mostly because he was never taught any different. After meeting his parents I see where he gets it from as they waste money on trips and goods they don't need despite being in debt. I am confident we can work on getting his habits to change and until then I have set up a budget for him to follow every month. 
 I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder last year and am not on any sort of medication, but I have been doing a lot of work with figuring out why I react to certain situations and dealing with my emotional triggers. I am extremely opinionated and admittedly too demanding  of other people at times in addition to being highly motivated to get where I want to be in life. I also keep track of my money very closely which has caused me some aggravation 
 Problem 
Lately I have been feeling like we are going separate ways with our lives, but trying to make them fit with each other anyways. He is a loving person and I know he is committed to trying to work things out. I am worried that I am with someone who I am not going to be satisfied with 10 years down the road. Even though we are working on money problems I feel like I am asking for too much change and he will resent me. He accepts every part of my life, especially all of the quirks I have and my personality issues, and I feel like I am not doing the same for him when I ask him to work on things. 
 Reddit, do you guys see any hope in the long term for this relationship? What needs to change (besides me finding another job I know!). Ideally I would like to be married by the end of another 4 years. I am not in any hurry and don't need that to know he is committed. I feel guilty that after all of the support he put in during our long distance period I would be willing to leave because he really is a super caring guy and makes me happy in a lot of ways. 
 I am working long hours this weekend but will try and answer questions since I know this isn't a great summary of everything. Any advice/opinions are appreciated.","I am dating a much older guy, working as one of his employees, and we both suffer from emotional/personality disorders. Help!",23,F,relationships
"we're both 19 and have been engaged for one year. 
 we started our first year of community college this fall with plans to transfer to a state university together after getting our AAs. the classes are easy pre-reqs and general eds, so the work isn't difficult but he lacks the motivation needed to do well. he won't do assignments or study unless pushed (usually by me) and skipping class is a weekly occurrence. he spends more time on xbox than he does on his coursework. i'm pretty sure he won't receive a passing grade for 2 of his 4 courses because of the exams and homework he missed. 
 whenever i mention these things to him, he'll tell me it's nothing to worry about and that he'll do better, but he doesn't put any effort into changing his ways. it's always ""i'll try"", never ""i will"". 
 normally this type of behavior isn't much to concern myself about and i'd rather end it than parent my SOs. however, i am genuinely hoping to marry this guy one day but i'm starting to doubt the prosperity of our future if he can't get his shit together. this isn't a situational thing, i know him well enough to confirm there's no circumstance preventing him from achieving besides his general unwillingness to do so. his grades weren't phenomenal in high school but he assured me it would change in college because the latter is more important. i'm beginning to see trusting that wasn't my smartest move. 
 i understand college isn't for everyone and thought maybe this was the problem, so i offered some thoughts on alternatives like trade school or the military (not encouraging him much on this one but it's something he's considered on his own before), but he refuses because he doesn't consider those to have as much prestige as a college education. i suggested changing his major from psychology to something else that might interest/suite him more, but he remains cemented in wanting to open his own therapy clinic. i just don't understand how he thinks that can happen things continue this way. 
 also, i'm the type of person who thrives with someone who pushes me to challenge myself, but i haven't gotten that with him. if anything, i've unfortunately taken on some of his bad habits and it's reflected in my grades, too. he'll ask me to skip with him and, not that it's his fault i say yes, but it's just not something that i would've done if he didn't offer. i'm allowing him to be a bad influence on my academic life. 
 besides this, he really is a great guy. if he wasn't, i'd have no reluctance in kicking his ass to the curb. i want us to have our nice life together, but he isn't holding things up on his end and it worries me that we'll have problems in the future because of it. besides talking to him, which has failed in the past, i have no idea how to or if i even can convince him to change. help?",i want to marry who puts little effort into his education and our future might suffer because of it. how do i convince him to change?,19,F,relationships
"So here is the story: about 3 months ago, I started really liking this boy (we'll call him John). At the time, my best friend of many years, who we'll call Karen, was going out with another guy. They broke up, and I was always there for her when she needed me. John and I became really close, and I was really starting to fall hard for him. I told Karen all about how I felt about him, and how much he meant to me. When she broke up with her boyfriend, she began to become good friends with John. As she became closer with him, I found him becoming more distant from me. I thought this was suspicious, but I gave them both the benefit of the doubt and decided not to mention it.
Last week, Karen confessed that her and John began developing feelings for each other. I was devastated, but I didn't want to hold them back from being happy. I told her I wouldn't care if she ever hooked-up with him, even though I secretly would. She assured me that she would NEVER, and she would try to stop spending time with him for my sake. Keep in mind, Karen is very much aware that I still have strong feelings for John. 
 HOWEVER, yesterday, I found out from a very reliable mutual friend that they have been having sex with each other for over a MONTH, even though she looked me in the eye a few days ago and PROMISED that she would never hook-up with him. Karen has seen me cry over John numerous times, and she of all people should understand how crazy I was over him. Here is the tricky part though: neither John nor Karen know that I am aware of their little affair, and they can't know that I am aware without me screwing over the mutual friend who told me about it. 
 So here is my question to you, Reddit: how should I handle this situation? I can't exactly confront them directly, because they will know that the mutual friend told their secret. However, I feel as if I can't just sit back and let them get away with this. Any advice at all regarding the situation and how I should respond would be helpful, and I will be sure to update as time goes on. By the way, we are all 18 years old and seniors in high school.","I fall for a boy, tell my best friend about it, and she lies to my face about having sex with him for weeks.",18,F,relationships
"Third attempt, had a few hits off the last one, but alas, nothing truly came of it...so here I go again. As stated, 30 male, caucasian, looking for a single female to talk to, chat with, whatever. Long story short, I'm really looking for someone to really be with. Not like a FWB or NSA or short term malarkey. I'm in the search for a real deal. I've been lost and lonely for quite some time and it's high time that came to an end. 
 Little about myself - 
 I like pretty much all kinds of music, less country and R&B. However I do tend to favor classic rock, 90's grunge, hard rock, underground hip-hop, and anything with bagpipes or an accordion...don't judge me. I watch a wide variety of shows on TV from documentaries, to sit coms, to cartoons. Nothing beats a bad zombie movie or just random horrible Indie B-movie. 
 I do play video games, as well as the occasional bout of D&D. I watch anime, read comic books (marvel, dark horse, image, indie, no DC). 
 Nerdiness aside, I also thoroughly enjoy the outdoors, hiking, paintball, riding ATV's and dirt bikes, fishing, swimming, a lot really. Can't really run right now due to a lingering ACL injury but eh...I cope. 
 I also cook. Very well actually. Especially on the grill. I can do interesting things with seafood and red meats on a grill. I know my way around the kitchen as well as the patio outside. Can cook pastas, Thai, Mexican, and have been known to make my own chili from scratch. 
 Random fun fact. I can also French braid hair. 
 Interests and such out of the way, I am currently seeking a new job as a disability has forced me to seek a new line of work, I have a stable home, a car and a bike. I am 6'2"" 175lbs. fit build, several tattoos, one hole in each ear and have my lip pierced. Now, as stated before, I am in no way just looking for a hookup, not looking for NSA or FWB or any of that. I'm seeking something real and long term.

"I was 16 years old when my dad took his own life. I only knew he shot himself until recently. My Dad had a really rough life. He took the life of a man in self-defense when he was about 11. Was molested by his uncle. Dealt with a junkie of a mother who left him to live with his grandparents. Was married twice. Had 4 kids and a stepson. Due to a car accident, he was out of work. It all finally got to him one day and he lost it. He shot a rifle at my stepmom and almost hit my younger brother. When he realized what he had done he turned the gun and said ""I'll kill myself then"" and fell to the floor. My stepmom said in all the years she had known him, that day she saw peace in his eyes. 
 Shortly after, I started to entertain the idea of smoking pot. Life was hard for me after he passed. Stopped carrying about school so I decided to join the USMC. Well after 9 months of training and waiting, I left for boot camp. My first night on Parris Island, I was thrown by a DI. From that moment until about a month later, I was literally beaten to the point that I threaten my own life and was sent home. 
 After realizing I had failed at my one hope at a new life, I finally got a joint off my buddy and smoked it up. It was reggies so I didn't get too high. Maybe a [4]. That was the first time, at 19 years old, that I ever smoked. 
 I started talking to my now girlfriend and found that she was against pot. So I gave it up. Only smoking once that she let slide. After a year and a half, we finally broke up. Now when we were together, we agreed no sex. Yes, I'm still a virgin. Well, she started dating the guy that was basically the whole reason we broke up. He raped her and now she is so emotionally damaged, she can't now be intimate with me. I got really into smoking and selling pot when we were broken up. So I was always about it. 
 When we got back together, my girlfriend had even started smoking herself. So we smoked a few times until I got busted. I got off but she had had enough. She made me quit. 
 Our relationship was good for awhile until she started sliding back into being the old girlfriend. We got so heated in a fight, just to end it, she told me to go smoke. Ok... so off I went. Just to piss her off more. I get back and she was seriously fine with me smoking. She realized I can control my anger so much better when high.

"The recruiting industry is almost entirely sustained on placing comsci employees that make at least 50k.  The deal is they place you at a company and take 10% of your salary as commission (this does not come out of your salary, but is a fee to the companies they place you at).  So, all you need to do to attract these recruiters is have a resume that looks like you are worth at least 45 or 50k or so.

"So, I'm [25M] close friends with 2 other girls and 1 guy. We get together often to hangout and chitchat/drink/eat. The two girls have been best friends since they were kids. Me and the guy are housemates. 
 A year ago or so, one of the girls (25F, let's call her Emily) found a boyfriend (supposedly 30M, let's call him Adam) off Tinder. She told us that he was studying for the bar exam. 
 We first met him when she brought him for a group road trip. Long story short, Adam forgot his ID, so he wasn't able to assist with driving nor go to the bars with us. Emily's best friend thought his actions were strange so we dug into his background online and found out that he was actually 37 - 7 years older than he told us. He was also a practicing lawyer. His facebook profile for Tinder was fake. 
 Emily was naturally extremely upset over this and confided in us. We told her to give it up, since a lie that huge implies this person can't be trusted. How would she know what else he's lied about, considering he hid his job and career for months!? However, after much back and forth, and Adam ""proving"" that he loves her, they are now dating again (more serious than ever). We decided that it was her life and she could date whoever she wants but we won't be involved. She has since then revealed a few things Adam did that seemed very manipulative. i.e. telling her not to take a job because she could get a better salary. Turns out, the reason is because the workplace is in close to one of her exes. I find that extremely insecure, manipulative, and shitty since clearly Adam is not thinking of her career growth. 
 This brings us to last week, Emily wanted to go to brunch. After setting things up with us, Emily said she wanted to bring Adam along. We all just kind of said, ""We cannot get over his first impression and his blatant lies. If the situation was reversed and it was one of your friends' SO that lied about their entire life and hurt them, what would you do? Would you still be ok with hanging out with this shitty person if your friend decided to forgive and bring them around? OR would that shitty person be the symbol of everything wrong in a relationship: Lies and manipulation."" 
 She was really upset at this and said to us, ""you guys aren't the ones dating Adam. If I chose to forgive him, why can't you all just accept that and hang out? You only know him from the venting I do, but there are nice things about him that I don't say."" 
 Now she's really upset at all of us because we do not want to be in a setting where Adam is there. I really hate it when friends gets treated awfully by their SOs, and then come to me and others for support, which we heartily give ...only for them to get mad at us when we don't forgive their SOs because they have. Are we bad friends? How do we frame this so that she'd understand our perspective?","Friend's boyfriend lied about something huge (age, job, basically entire life) and has shown manipulative behavior.

"I'm a 17 year old who does not get along with his parents whatsoever. Sure, I sound like most kids around my age, but I need help-- I don't know what to do with myself. See, I'm getting kicked out as soon as I turn 18, and the clock is ticking. I will get no support from my family for college/university, and they're basically saying ""Good Luck"" and throwing me out. The military is an option, but at this point is only a last resort. What can I do? 
 My life story (It's really not a good situation.): I was physically and verbally abused constantly by both my mother and father when I was small. My dad was an alcoholic and my mother just has a temper problem. My dad will get drunk, my mom would get upset, and I could do the smallest thing like not put away my sega genesis correctly, and they'd beat the shit out of me. This continued until I was about 7 when one day, my grandparents decided to do a surprise visit and found me a bloody mess. They called the cops who called cps and had my parents investigated. Ultimately, nothing happened. Things calmed down until the investigation was over, and then went right back to the beatings. My parents divorced and I lived with my mother after. At 10, I ended up running away barefoot with no shirt on my back or shoes in ~25 degree (F) weather. I ran to my grandparents' house. Called cops again, and the cop basically called me a spoiled brat and that I deserve to get beat. I later found out that because of my mother's job, she was friends with most of the area's officers. 
 My grandparents ended up taking me in. They took me home to get my stuff and I left with them. But I left behind a younger sister who was 6 at the time. She was never subject to any abuse though. I was an emotionally distraught child who did not respond well to people yelling/being loud; I would tremble in fear and freeze up. After a few years, my grandparents help me put my head on straight, and everything was going great. But then I start to get calls from my younger sister that it started happening to her. I urged her to come with me and our grandparents, but she wouldn't. She was easily manipulated by my mother to stay. After a while, I gave up on her. 
 But then my mom got pregnant by the man she whom she married after I left, and she said she was moving halfway across the country with this man, my sister, and my soon to be born sibling. (my step father is a good man but very passive. Can witness the abuse and turn a blind eye because of my mother's tendencies). By this time, I'm 15 years old and my grandparents ask me to go with them and be a guardian of sorts to make sure they don't get abused. So I move with them. I've protected both sisters and gotten into fights/arguments. Cops have been called, cps investigations have happened. Nothing. They never find anything. My grandmother also protects my mother every time-- tells my mom she is wrong, but will never testify against her. 
 Things have somewhat calmed down. I've imposed my will, and she learned that she could not physically abuse me any longer since I am bigger and stronger. There will be an outburst every now and then where she will try to beat up my sister (the older), and I'll pull her off and wrestle her down until she gives up (I've trained in mma/wrestling/bjj for many years). But the verbal abuse continues. 
 Basically I'm a good for nothing leech that won't even be able to finish college or do anything successful in my life. I'll eventually turn to drugs and be an alcoholic like my father, so before that happens, they want me out of my house. (words of my mother) My stepdad was convinced that I was being kicked out to promote independence.

"Here's the deal. I've played too much Xbox, and Call of Duty, and Halo, and all that. I had seen my brother play ArmA II before, and I liked it, but I knew that I had no means of getting a computer at that age. Now, a couple years later, I'm willing to take up the challenge. 
 Now, of course, this shouldn't seem like a challenge. But trust, me it is. I want to build a gaming computer which can run ArmA II substantially, but I have no income.

"Hi, all, first time redditor here, this is just my second post, and I need some help. 
 I'll start by describing myself to give you a little bit of insight into my situation. 
 I'm a 22 year old senior male in college, I stand at about 6 foot 2 inches and weigh roughly 245 pounds, I've been hitting the gym lately to fix that problem. I'm generally very quiet and work focused at school but am outgoing when people engage me or in the classroom. 
 My situation is this, I've been seeing a lot of strange body language and behavior from women lately. I've noticed that particular women will go out of their way to avoid me. I've never spoken to any of these women--though one of them is acquainted with my older sister and another is heavily involved in my degree program--I see them often, just by being around the school. 
 Here are a few example situations: 
 About a week ago, one of these women seemed to follow me into the printing room, saw that I was preoccupied, and proceeded to pass me, turn her back, and stare at a blank bulletin board for what seemed like an eternity. 
 The second situation, this time with a different girl, seemed to be a clear case of avoidence of initimidation. I was sitting at a computer in the library and turned to look at the noise down the hall. I made eye contact with the young lady and what followed was a hilariously unsubtle change in direction. She literally turned on her heel and went through the printing room to the adjacent hallway. Mind you, the way our library is set up, both hallways lead to the same destination. 
 A similar situation happened with a third woman just the other day. 
 It's been bothering me, because it's mostly behavior just coming from these three. Are they afraid of me, or physically intimidated or something? 
 I make a point to mind my posture and I make a lot of eye contact with people in general. And from what I know of the first girl, she isn't exactly shy.","Pretty girls that I've never talked to seem to be avoiding me, is this common?

"I've thought about posting this on here so many times, and even though it's anonymous, it's still difficult for me to type out.
I'm a 21 year old female who was in a relationship with a slightly younger guy for several years (on and off). While I did truly love him, our relationship was very immature and he moved many times throughout our relationship to try to find himself. The total time that we were officially and actually together was probably about a year. Not trying to give too much away about our relationship to make sure I'm not recognized, but we have been completely and totally over for a very decent amount of time now. We never had sex, and once again...not to give too much away...just trust that it was for good reason and our relationship wasn't based on that.
Now to get to the gritty details...
I had ALWAYS found his dad incredibly attractive, and noticed that he would sometimes flirt with me (not blatantly, but little things that I noticed here and there). I have since moved out of town, and my ex has moved out of state, and I CANNOT stop thinking about his dad. I have so many fantasies about going back to my hometown and maybe leaving him a note or something with my phone number on it? I do not have any interest in him other than physical...while he is a nice guy, I could never ""date"" my ex's dad. I know he genuinely cares about me as a person, as me and his son were together all the time and constantly at his house (I probably should have mentioned at the beginning that his dad is single), yet I can't help but think he's probably thought about it too. His dad is NOT conservative by any means and lives a very laid back lifestyle by the beach or in the mountains or something along those lines ;) very hippie-esque.
Bottom line Reddit...is this something better left to fantasy? I've been telling myself that for months, but now he's making his way into my dreams and I don't even find myself physically attracted to guys my age because I'm hung up on this! I know you guys are not here to judge, so I really need an honest opinion! Thanks :)

"EDIT: Sorry its so long. I did not mean for it to get like that. I just sort of kept writing and it felt good to write it out. 
 Hi reddit. I’ve been internally struggling with an issue and can’t really find a solution so I made a post to get some advice. Any and all points of view are welcome. Throwaway because the girlfriend goes on reddit. 
 So I’m a 20 year old male and I have been in a long distance relationship with a girl my age for the past 2 years. She is an amazing, awesome lady. When I think about her it’s almost all positives. I find her beautiful and sexy, there are no problems with my physical attraction to her. She and I get along very well when we are together. We both enjoy similar things and never run out of things to talk about, sometimes we even spend 2-3 hours on the phone talking. I don’t have any real issues with her personality either. She is great. The problem is I only see her about 4 months out of the year. I go to school far away from where she goes to school and it’s a bit of an issue for a couple of reasons. 
 Firstly, she is way more emotionally and sexually needy then I am. She needs to be reassured of my love for her constantly. I have to call her every night before I go to bed for anywhere between an hour or two at least. I enjoy talking to her but every night is tiring for me and I feel bad asking for a night off because I know she looks forward to it all day. It also is affecting both of our sleep patterns because I stay up pretty late doing things I enjoy doing whether it be with friends or alone. I don’t want to sacrifice those things so I wait until I go to bed to call her.  Its tiring to me because I don’t need to talk to her that often but she does. I’m perfectly happy calling her twice a week and having a long conversation with her but every day is too much for me. I’ve talked to her about it before and she says she understands but I know she doesn’t because if we get in a fight or she is sad she will bring up that she feels I don’t love her as much as I love her. It’s not that I don’t love her as much at all, I just am different and don’t need to express it as often. This is frustrating for me. 
 She also needs more attention than I do sexually. Its fine when I’m with her, I can deal with having sex 2-3 times a day. I love sex and sex with her is very satisfying for both of us. We are very comfortable with each other and our sex is great because of it. The only downfall I would say is that she doesn’t give good head, but that is improving and isn’t a big deal. The problem arises when we are separated. She refuses to touch herself or give herself any sexual satisfaction. So if I haven’t seen her for 2-3 months she gets really frustrated and it affects the relationship. 
Some weeks she will call me and cry saying she needs me and that she can’t take it anymore, this is really hard for me. I try my best to be there for her but nothing I say helps because she needs my attention to emotionally and sexually relax her.  She can’t do either of those things on her own. 
 The second major issue I see is that she is much more mature then I am. She is very close to being ready to take things to the next level. I am happy where things are, of course I wish she was in the same city as me so I could see her more, but I am definitely not ready to share a place with her. She on the other hand is not only ready for this but seems to crave it. At one point a few months ago she kind of broke down and gave me an ultimatum. She said I had to choose either to have her come and live with me or that she was done. I told her that I needed time to think. I talked to a bunch of friends and they helped me realise that I am in no way ready for her to live with me. It has nothing to do with her, just at the current point in my life its not what I want. I also started feeling really guilty because I realised that my priority is myself and my life with my friends. I had never realised before but I asked myself if I had to choose between my amazing group of friends (who are like my family now) and her then I would choose my friends every time. She hasn’t even done anything wrong, it’s just where I am right now. 
 Anyways so the next day I called her and told her I wasn’t ready to live with her but I would be happy if she chose to move closer to me. She said she couldn’t do that but that she was also sorry for asking that of me and that she was just having a hard time. We talked for about 4 hours and agreed to keep trying. The thing is that I now realised she isn’t my top priority and I am hers. Sometimes we discuss our future and she wants to be living with me at least in the next 1-3 years and I’m not going to be ready for that (I don’t think).
On top of this there are a lot of women around me. I love girls. I don’t want to be 40-50 years old and look back and not have experienced different women. All my friends are single and I really enjoy going out and flirting with women but I haven’t got to do that because I am in a relationship. I’m 20 and live in a city where lots is going on. I don’t want to miss my opportunity to be a bachelor (something I’ve looked forward to since I was young). 
 Overall I am just really confused about what I want / should do and need some advice. She is an amazing lady and I don’t want to be stuck with someone in my future and look back wishing I was spending my life with her. I also don’t want to look back and wish I had experienced more. So what do you guys think?","Am 20 year old male, have amazing long distance girlfriend of 2 years. She is a bit too emotionally needy but I really love her and enjoy her company. I’ve realized that my priorities are me and my friends and not her at this point in my life. She is mature for her age and wants to move in soon and settle down. I am not ready to settle down. I don’t want to look back on my life and have missed out on my youth and experiences BUT also don’t want to look back and wish I was still with this lady because she is so awesome. Any advice or point of view for me to think on is greatly appreciated. The relationship is also stressful because of the long distance. Ask any questions as well. She is very important to me and I really appreciate any and all help. Thank you.",20,M,relationships
"I was a daily smoker for a long time, going through an eighth a week. 
 I am 6'2"" and have been losing weight.  I had peaked at 252 a couple of months ago and am now down to 225. 
 I knew the weight loss was working against me in terms of testing, but I thought after 4 weeks I would have been clean. 
 I got furloughed at work due to a positive test at 21 days of not smoking and got myself tested at 28 just for my own peace of mind.  That pretty much blew up in my face and now my anxiety is nauseating. 
 As I mentioned in a previous post, that home test I got at Rite Aid showed me negative at 14 days.  So do not rely on home tests. 
 I just want these metabolites out of my system for good.  I want to know for sure that I could pass any future employment tests, but I don't want to part with another $50 while I have no money coming in.  Plus the nice lady at the lab I went to became decidedly snobby when I told her why I was there.   Like I need more judgement in my life. 
 I am NOT looking for ways to pass a test; I want to be legitimately clean and I am incredibly mad at myself for what I have done to my body that causes it to leach this stuff after four weeks.",I am pissed off at myself for not being able to piss clean.

"This is a really tough and broad question for anyone to answer, but bear with me, I am trying my best. First, here is some background on me: I'm a college student at a rather large university, in a fraternity, and I am mostly a sociable person. I consider myself handsome and intelligent. 
 I've been in only one ""official"" relationship in my freshman year. In which case I was faithful %100 to her (this is the internet so I promise no lying). She went batshit crazy on me and started accusing me of cheating on her since I was in a fraternity and I'd go to various social events where she couldn't attend. So after a year and a half of dating, I broke it off. 
 I tried again at a real relationship the next year. I fell in love with this girl. ( I courted her for a few months but actually dated for only a week or so) I'll call her Cassy. Cassy ended up breaking my heart and crushing my self confidence. She seemed like ""the one"", even though I was only 20 at the time. 
 Past that, I've been with many girls over the past 3 years. I haven't really kept a tally, but I'd estimate between 20-25 hookups/ fuck buddy type relationships since the break up with Cassy. (This is no boast; in fact I'm kind of ashamed of it) 
 I go from girl to girl, we hook up, if she has the personality of a rock, then usually it ends there. A few girls stick around longer and we'll hit it off. A month or so later, things start getting to be a drag. But at this point girls begin to learn things about my messed up childhood and they feel bad and naturally want to help me. 
 As soon as a girl starts to become attached and I immediately distance myself from them. Sex becomes unappealing, no matter how attractive the girl, and I kind of go numb. I feel apathetic towards the girl and the relationship starts going downhill from there. When the girl starts feeling me slipping away she'll ask things such as ""Are you like, okay?"" or "" do you have any emotions at all towards me?"". They begin to see my flaws, and I begin to further distance myself. 
 I'm starting to feel like I won't ever find the right girl for me. I like the idea of marriage all ball and chain jokes aside. I'm convinced its completely hopeless for me. What could I be doing wrong? Is it my perspective that needs to be changed? Can anyone relate?",I went through a bunch of shit relationships and slept with 20~ women and now I feel nothing and I can't find anyone I think I could have a healthy relationship with. How do I deal with this?,20,M,relationships
"We've been seeing each other for about 2 months. I have only seen a side of her that is kind, happy, gentle, and understanding.  My friends really like her and I do too.  She always has a huge smile on her face, is adventurous,  doesn't seem needy, and I'm comfortable being my weird self around her. 
 My friends are really overprotective about me because I've had some real shitty girlfriends and they've urged me to have her come hang with the guys so they can feel her out. She's been very social with them and genuinely interested in their lives and getting to know them.  They love her.  She recently met my mom and they were like two peas in a pod, which is important to me because I'm very close with my mom.  Here's where the possible crazy comes in. 
 We've had sex but she won't let me see her with the lights on.  She won't go swimming with me but is usually down for anything.  I thought maybe she was insecure about her body.  Nope.  I convinced her to finally come swimming and then I noticed it.  Her legs are so badly scarred.  They're covered in deep scars from her cutting herself. Literally covered.  I asked a mutual friend of ours about her, and he did not have good things to say. He said ""stay away.  She dated the guy I used to buy weed from, and she was crazy.  She was a meth head and very suicidal.  She has a lot of problems."" 
 I talked to her about all this and she told me about her very terrible past.  Abusive boyfriend that used to beat her, was homeless and on drugs, tried to kill herself, etc.  This was all when she was 19 (four years ago) and she has 3.5 years clean of cutting and drugs.  She assures me she was worried Id judge her but she has grown up a lot and is no longer that person. That she is truly spiritually sound now and enjoys life, and her past only gives her a greater appreciation of it. 
 I am really freaked out Reddit.  I like this girl a lot but I feel like she may just be on her best behavior for me.  I know that 19 to 23 is a huge age gap but a part of me says ""once a crazy junkie always a crazy junkie."" Maybe I'm being judgmental I'm just really scared to get hurt or in a bad situation. 
 Does anyone have experience with situations like this? I want to continue things but I'm really freaked out. I don't want to hurt her or get hurt.

"I am a 22 yo male who goes to a top tier, out-of-state college for engineering. Due to my recent grades, I have lost my scholarship (around 1/3 of college/living cost). My parents are threatening to stop supporting me unless I give them the money during my summer internship. They make well over the FAFSA limit and would have no problem supporting the extra cost.
Finances: My tuition + housing (food from M-F lunch, not weekends) would be ~$35000.
I am going into my senior year and graduating on time. I plan to keep my internship into Fall, but I can only work 10-15 hours at a reduced pay. 
 Background:  I studied abroad Spring ‘11 and gained a girlfriend from the experience. My parents are religious Southerners who claim to not be racist toward her. Every time I mention her, they just jump to another topic. I helped pay for her to visit me for a month at the beginning of 2012 with the money I made working the previous summer. They got in an outrage, claiming that I had spent their money on her.
To compare, my sister is also in college. I know that they spend about $20,000 more a semester on her. 
 They are repeating their actions by limiting me from visiting her with the money I make this summer. I am reduced to an item of ownership. I love my girlfriend, but having to wait until I graduate to see her (assuming my job allows for the time) will further burden our very long-distance relationship. 
 Questions:  Is there any way to repair my relationship with my parents at this point? The other bomb I haven’t dropped is that I became an atheist during college.
I do not meet any of the requirements to become independent. Should I get a student loan, knowing that I should make around $60,000 after graduation? I know that I shouldn’t assume for my parents to support me. However, I am unable to get any financial aid due to their income.

Not only do I live with them, I'm also their boss and work with them daily.

"I feel like a massive twat saying this out loud. I feel like this not a real 'problem', and that I'm just too weak or perverted or deluded. But it is actually eating away at me day and night, and, having recently discovered the wonder that is Reddit, I need a medium to vent - and if any advice is forthcoming, wonderful. But I'm not expecting any sympathy. 
 I'm a dude, almost 30. I was in an extremely unhappy, often abusive, relationship for about 5 years with someone who almost certainly has serious mental health issues. I became pretty depressed, smoked and drank my way through life for a while. One day, I packed my bags and moved abroad for good, left the nutjob ex, and in doing so met an absolutely wonderful gal, with whom I have fallen in love. She is fun, easy to talk to, grounded, intelligent, cute, and holds much the same fundamental beliefs that I do. My family love her, and we NEVER fight. It is about as blissful a relationship as I could have hoped for. We got engaged after about a year and I am excited to make a life and family with her. 
 However, I am not, in the basest sense of the phrase, sexually attracted to her. 
 Yeah, kudos to me for falling in love with her personality, etc etc. It's not that she's ugly. She is actually very pretty, and I'm sure she would have a queue of guys lining up to take my place. Problem is I never really found her 'hot'; alluring and radiant, certainly, but not 'sexy'. She has also put on a bit of weight since we have been together - she never had the hourglass figure thing going on but she used to be a lot more slender. When we first got together I didn't really care, as I (honestly) fell in love with her as a person, not for her appearance. But time (and lack of gym-time and poor diet) has magnified what I originally thought was a non-issue, and it is starting to affect my sex life, and as a result, my relationship with my future wife. 
 Our sex life has always been pretty good (verging on very good), but I am finding it increasingly difficult to get in the mood. I feel more obliged than inclined to have sex, and although I make sure to please her every time, feel it is perfunctory and uninteresting. Seeing her naked does very little for me. I know this is probably normal for any long-term relationship... (?) but I think she is starting to work it out, and I feel TERRIBLE. We are very open with our feelings but there is no way in hell I would be able to put any of this into words to her for fear of her getting some pretty serious self-esteem issues (she's had some bad times, too). 
 Without blowing my own trumpet too hard, I am not a bad-looking guy. Never had issues getting girls, fairly athletic, etc. And since moving abroad I have been working out a lot, and my job is well paid. Now I'm in a new country, I also have 'the accent'. In short, I've had offers. LOTS of offers. And I'm not really used to it. I had a (hot) mother of 3 young kids send me a lewd video out of the blue. I've had an absolutely stunning 19 year-old blonde greet me naked and pretty much beg me to lay her. I panicked and pretty much ran. I've had more interest than I know what to do with, all of which I've turned down flat. I just don't know if I can do it for the rest of my life. 
 Problem is, I find myself fantasizing about these women. About what it would be like to have someone jaw-droppingly hot in the bedroom, someone who I get turned on just by touching their hand, who other guys look at in the street and wish she was theirs. I have dreams - not just sporadically, but most nights - that I am fucking an insanely hot girl. My subconscious screams for it, and it is pervading its way into my conscious. I find I ogle women all the time, and wonder what they look like naked. 
 I am totally expecting you all to say that because guys are guys, they all think like that, you just gotta keep it in your pants, get some goddamn self-control. And you're right. But it has got to the point where I am watching more porn than is healthy, where I have been caught out looking at other women, and quality and quantity of sex is rapidly declining. I love my fiance dearly and don't want to hurt her, but I am absolutely terrified of succumbing to carnal desires at some point before I die. 
 I often wonder how much this has to do with my previous relationship, as it was hellish and brought me some pretty severe issues. I wonder how many other people have the same problem. Please, anyone out there that feels me, I'd love to know your thoughts.",I not sexually attracted to my wife-to-be and am scared of being seduced and ruining the best relationship I've ever had.,29,M,relationship_advice
"I moved this to an AMA instead. 
 Mine is a very long story, but I think Reddit may find it interesting and upsetting. 
 I am a upper middle class 24 year old male. I come from a great family. I have a biology degree from a top university and a 3.5 GPA. I never thought this would happen to me. 
Last year, my now ex-roommate throughout college was nickel and diming small bags of pot out of our house. Not a big deal usually, except he grew to have ZERO discretion. We eventually moved off campus into a neighborhood full of old retired women. Great house, we were done partying, things were good. We (other roommate and I) made it very clear he couldn't do things the way he had been anymore due to snooping neighbors. He developed an almost literal revolving door policy. Anyway, he kept it up and people caught on. As it turned out, he had also grown two plants in our attic that I was unaware of. I got very nervous about the situation, and a week before I planned to move out, the local narcotics department raided my house. The police corruption involved in this is sickening: 
 The warrant reads that a confidential informant purchased multiple pounds of marijuana. Not true The two dead, chopped and harvested plants were reported as ""Currently growing 5 or more plants"" bc anything over four plants is a FELONY.
 Two bags with 4 total grams of pot in the house. Charged with ""Trafficking marijuana, 8oz. to 5 pounds"". Evidence used to obtain that weight, two containers of ""pot"" cookies with no pot in them; FELONY My friend, by random chance, left his prescription for adderall in my room. Mind you, the FULL bottle was still in the STAPLED SHUT bag from rite aid. The pills were poured into a plastic bag, I was charged with trafficking a schedule two controlled substance; FELONY. 
*About a year prior to this, I took some mushrooms for the first time. It was a blast and harmless. I left the bag with nothing but dust in it in the top of my closet. After tearing my entire house apart, it was found and contained a lab tested .7 MICROGRAMS of psilocybin. I was charged with a TRAFFICKING FELONY for this. 
I have been diagnosed with nerve damage in my shoulder due to not being properly handcuffed for 6 hours and thrown around my house. 
 I was drawn down by 14 police and the county sheriff, cuffed, interrogated, intimidated, arrested, and charged. The police violated my privacy by hacking my iphone passcode. Yes they can do that. Found two texts minimally related to roommates dealings, so to them I was part of his ""cartel"". The judge would not reduce my $28,000 bail right away, so I spent two nights in jail with my parents doing everything they could to get me out. Hell, I had to be transported to court in shackles riding next to a guy who got convicted of a double homicide and sent to prison for life that day. 
 I lawyered up, BIG TIME (Barry Badrinath was his name I think). For 8 months I struggled to contain myself from having anxiety attacks due to being charged with 3 felonies and two misdemeanors carrying a total 17 possible years jail time reduced to an offer of 4 years. The prosecutor took his sweet ass time to go look at the evidence. Not until the day I was to enter my guilty plea or go to trial,what I thought was going to be the worst day of my life, did they drop all charges, and me to my knees. The other innocent roommate had the same fortune. The only one doing anything illegal was charged with misdemeanor trafficking; he got two years probation. 
 Needless to say this was far beyond my scope of horrible experiences. I always have, and still have respect for law enforcement, but I can't help but be jaded after seeing such corruption first hand. I am so thankful the court system cleaned up the mistake the authorities made.","My roommate was selling dime bags of marijuana. Subsequent to police corruption, our house was raided, all of us were arrested, abused, charged with MULTIPLE FELONIES, but eventually proven innocent. 
 Redditors, after reading my novel, What is the worst ""Guilty By Association"" moment you've ever had or heard of? 
 When all was said and done, it was a blessing. I lacked the direction, inspiration and motivation to be truly goal oriented; because I smoked too much pot. I tried multiple times to stop to no avail. I haven't smoked since. I met an amazing girl who I see myself marrying. I started a career. All good things. 
 It should also be noted that I agree with everyone who points out the lapse in judgement, for the most part. The roommate is not a bad person, he needs to break his addiction to pot, which can exist in any smoker. We don't see each other anymore. However, I think it the way it was handled by the police is what should be the main focus of the story.",24,M,AskReddit
"Hey!  A thread I can participate in!  My parents divorced in 2000 when I was 3.  The attorneys agreed on 3 days with one parent, then three days with another, but we've never been that strict about it.  Before I say anything else, let me just say that they're both great people and I love both of them, but they just became incompatible and I'm not angry at either one of them for the decision they made.  I'm actually glad for what they did, because now I have an awesome step family on my mother's side that I wouldn't have had otherwise. 
 When they first divorced, I had no idea what was going on, but it's one of my earliest memories.  I remember just asking them to please stay together, because I didn't want to live in two different houses, not see my mom sometimes, and not see my dad sometimes.  For a year or so after that, my memory is kind of blurry.  I remember using a computer for the first time during that period (win 98 on an old gateway). 
 About 3 years after the divorce, life was starting to reach a pattern, because both of my parents were working on getting their living areas situated during those times.  I had to go to daycare and after-school events a lot because both of my parents were working a ton.  I had a big family on both sides, so Christmases and Birthdays were always doubled (best part for young-me).  My mom had a few boyfriends over the next few years (all decent guys, didn't work out though), but my dad stayed single and still is (that was already his second marriage and he had me late in life in his late forties).  For those few years, it was just back and forth between both houses. 
 I had a lot of counseling in early elementary school, it was nice, but I never really cared.  I knew it wasn't my fault, it was just time to play board games and talk instead of having to be in class. 
 As everything has progressed, everything has been pretty normal.  As I described above, it has been nice having the double holidays, but I tend towards staying with my mom more, because she is much less strict. 
 Middle school was probably the worst time for me.  First of all, that was just an awkward period in my life (pretty sure some other people will share that same sentiment) and I didn't have too many friends.  I was playing baseball recreationally, but my dad wanted me to take lessons so I could get better.  I did at first, but later didn't want to and my dad didn't like that.  My mom was on my side, and has always just wanted me to do what I want.  For a while, everything was really bitter between my mom & I and my dad.  My dad pressured me throughout middle school up until 9th grade (11th now).  When I became a sophomore, I still played, but I said fuck it and stopped practicing because I liked academics more. 
 Right now, I'm in 11th grade and this year has been my best in a long time (personally, socially, and physically) in a long time.  I stopped caring about sports, focused on school, and have been staying with my mother more.  I still love my dad, but it's just easier being here because of the laid-back nature of this house. 
 Holy shit,","Parents divorced when I was 3.  It was nice because of double holidays.  Attorneys agreed to 3 days at each house, but I now stay at my mom's more because of how laid-back it is.  Mom remarried to who is now a great step-dad, dad is still single.  There were a lot of tense years where my parents argued a lot and I argued with my dad a lot, but I'm doing pretty great right now (16 y/o).  Sorry I kind of rambled, it just kinda happened.

"This is purely matter of fact with nothing left out.
I'm 22 years old, always had fantastic hair, thick, dark, healthy, great hairline. Started working out at 17 years old, Did 3 year naturally until I was 20 - then went on roids. All cycles and also now blast+cruise. I started on Test. Have done a bunch of cycles of test plus the orals - dianaol, anavar, turinabol. In total done about 8months worth of test+tren accross 3 cycles.

 Did 3 things 6 months ago - stopped tren, stayed on 250mg a week test e. started finasteride 1mg od, 1ml pure rosemary oil on the scalp focused on the front and sides (Pumpkin seed oil (PSO) has been shown to block the action of 5-alpha reductase and to have antiandrogenic effects on rats - and rosemary oil has the same mechanism of action). 
 Right now my hair is better than it has ever been in my life. Regrowth noticed every single week. Its so thick and healthy. This is with me on test 250mg/week. 
 As far as my gym progress goes. I dont really have a control since I changed up quite a few things (went from 400mg test e 800mg tren e ew to simply 250mg/week test e. Initially I noticed a drop in strength.

"As many stories begin, this happened some time ago, about six years back to be exact. It's a long one, but I promise its worth the read. 
 It was my freshman year in college and I was going to a school over three hours away from home. The original plan was to room with a buddy from high school, but due to an administrative error in the Housing Department, we were split up. I was pretty bummed about the situation and upset that I was going to have to share a tiny space with a total stranger for an entire year. In an attempt to make up for the clerical error, the Housing Department placed me in one of the nicer dormitories usually set aside for athletes on scholarship instead of making me stay in the doldrums that were the freshman dorms. 
 The situation ended up working out in my favor. My roommate was one of the nicest and most passive kids in the world. He was up from Texas (we're in Tennessee) to go to school closer to his girlfriend, who had received a music scholarship to a school about 30 minutes away. He ended up walking on to the tennis team over the summer and was placed in this new swanky dorm with me. 
 Now a little backstory on the dorm we were in. The hall we were in was actually one of the older ones on campus, but had been remodeled a few years back when they decided to recommission it as one of the athletic dorms. It was an outdoor entrance dorm, almost a motel style, paired with an identical building that formed a nice little courtyard between the two (gotta keep those fornicatin' little hoodlums separated). It was also unique in that it was quad style. This meant that instead of sharing one large bathroom with an entire floor of frosh who couldn't pick up after themselves, you only shared it with three other rooms, so 8 people total. Keep this in mind for later. 
 I had decided to rush a fraternity that semester. This ended up not being my scene or anything that I enjoyed, but I digress. Anyways, its the weekend of fall break and our quad had completely emptied out, save myself and my roommate. He had things going on with the tennis team and I had some type of bullshit ritual retreat I had to go to for my pledge process. 
 So its early early Saturday morning, around 7 AM, and I was getting ready to leave for the weekend. I proceeded in my morning routine and my roommate did the same. He got a little later start than I did, so he was in the shower as I was brushing my teeth and getting ready to walk out the door. Now, in the quad style bathroom, you had the central bathroom with the four rooms that shared it adjacent to it on the outside. All the rooms locked the bathroom by deadbolt from inside your dorm so no one from the other rooms in the quad could come into yours unannounced. It had become a habit for me to lock the door as I left the bathroom without thinking, so that's what I did. I finished brushing my teeth and headed out to meet my pledge class at the fraternity house. 
 Keep in mind, we were being sent out of town for the weekend and wouldn't be back until early Monday morning. When we arrived at the fraternity house, my entire pledge class, save the class president, had to turn over our phones to the brothers so that we couldn't get any insight in to what exactly we were getting ourselves into from the more lenient brothers. So we all pile into a few cars and head out on the road. 
 Fast forward to around 4 AM Monday morning when my pledge class arrives back from what I'll only describe as a very uncomfortable few days. By the time we got back, all I wanted to do was pile into my single bed for the rest of fall break. If only it were that easy. 
 When I arrived back to the fraternity house to pick up my car, I was met by our Chapter President and a look of uneasiness on his face. He swiftly gave me my phone back and said that I needed to go to the Campus Police station immediately. He wouldn't tell me why, but only stated, ""It sounds pretty fucking serious."" So I drive to the police department and let the clerk know who I am and they immediately take me back to the police chief's office. After a few minutes the chief walks in and shows me a picture of my roommate and asks if I know who this is. 
 ""Yea that's my roommate, blankedy blank. Why?"" 
 ""Well he's been reported as missing. He was last heard from Friday night and is soon to be categorized as a missing person. When was the last time you heard from him?"" 
 My mind being kind of numb from the lack of sleep I was forced to endure over the weekend, I start to rack my brain and then proceed to say, "" I saw him Saturday morning when we were both getting ready in the….."" 
 Then it hit me. I had unwittingly locked my roommate in our bathroom for over two days. Ho. Lee. Shit. 
 I tell the police chief the story and he sends me with a patrol officer back to my dorm to see if my story held up. When we arrive back I rush to the bathroom door and unlock. Sure enough, there is my roommate sitting on the floor of the bathroom with nothing on but a towel and a thousand yard stare.

"I was 14 years old and my g/f at the time was a virgin. We had been having a hard time having sex because it wouldn't go in. It was a bit thick for her, being a virgin and all.

 Her brother had drove her over to my house and was in the other room. I had locked the door, but after we had been alone in there for a few mins he decided to start banging on the door. We decided to go for it anyway. With the blood it was much easier to get it in. 
 So I lost my virginity in a bloody mess while her brother was banging on the door, the whole time. After we were done, I decided to get him back.

"When I was a teenager (and on the pill) I thought that all my hormonal, crazy behaviour/mentality was just normal teenager stuff. Soon after I got the Implanon implant I started a long term relationship and figured I was just growing out of it or settling down. Two Implanon's and six years later I figured I'd change things up a bit and switch to an IUD. Well since I didn't manage to plan ahead properly I ended up having about a 6week break between the Implanon out and the IUD in and the doc gave me a version of the pill that used the same hormones as my planned IUD. 
 I went FUCKING BATSHIT! I was overly emotional, worried my boyfriend didn't love me anymore, that he didn't find me attractive, that he'd leave me for someone else. Every little thing would set me off. The worst part was that I could see myself acting irrationally but could not help myself but think or feel like that. 
 When I went back to the doctors for the IUD we discussed how I'd gone and all my concerns about the hormones and decided that it'd be best to stick to the Implanon, after all I'd never had an issue with it. 
 The funniest thing to me is my psychologist always seemed wary of it, like he didn't like the idea of it pumping me full of hormones. Turns out I need those hormones to even me out or something because without them, or using different BC, I am a nightmare for me and everyone I encounter.","Find a birth control that works for  you .

"I ran my first HM a few weeks ago and haven't been able to get running out of my mind since! (Un)fortunately, I'm a medical student in my last year of school, so I have 80-hour work weeks to look forward to starting in late June/early July, so I'd love to run my first marathon before that time. 
 A friend is running the LA Marathon, one of Competitor Magazine's 15 bucket-list marathons, on 2/14/16, and it just so happens the Nike Running intermediate marathon training plan recommended for my running ability takes 16 weeks. This may be my last chance to run the LA Marathon for several years, as I'm not sure where the residency match will take me or if I'll even have the time or energy to train for a marathon.

 Does anyone have any experience with this training plan?

"I'm a very skinny, short (113lbs, 5'6''--I've been destitute for months, but just got a job and looking into joining a gym while subscribed to /r/gainit/) 23 year old college student, and I usually just wear raw denim/chinos, a plain white t-shirt/OCDB, and a sweater/cardigan (so the basic MFA uniform--I need to get together a basic wardrobe before starting to find a personal style). I own a pair of CDBs in taupe suede, and they're extremely comfortable! They're boots that feel like sneakers, and it's great. But I was looking for something that was obviously more of a boot, and I want it to be something I'll only have to buy once. I'd like a toecap too, in a brown. 
 Now, I've looked into the Red Wing Iron Rangers, and it looks perfect for what I'm looking for. I've read they last and are good quality, long-lasting boots, but is there anything else in that price range (~$300-400) I should be looking into? I know of the Wolverine 1000 Mile series, but the closest thing I like is the normal 1000 Mile boot, which lacks a toecap. I strongly dislike the look of moc toes, as well, and wingtips are a little more formal than my style permits--I don't want my shoes to stand out for the wrong reasons. 
 So basically, I'm looking for a timeless workboot that'll last me at least a decade (with proper upkeep), with a toecap, between $300 and $400. If it matters at all, I have very narrow feet, in a size 7, and I live in a desert, so leather soles are fine, and I prefer their look as well. 
 Update from /r/goodyearwelt: So far I'm REALLY liking the [Oak Street Trench Boot]( with a capped toe. 
 I won't be actually ""working"" in these--I'm currently a cashier at a gas station, but should soon be at a downtown coffeeshop if I play my cards right. So yeah, you could say hipster or whatever, but eh.

"I've had my ability to trust people completely shattered by exes. I'm 22 and have been in two serious realtionships in my time. Both of the girls that I was with ended up cheating on me and ending the relationship. After the first one ended, I was able to throw myself into various activities to keep myself occupied, and eventually met the girl that I would go on to date until just recently. When her and I first started dating, she knew that I had trust issues, and while they cause issues, I forced myself to trust her. It was the best and the worst decision of my life. 
 For the next year and a half, we were blissful, and I knew she was the one. But then she started to act distant, always texting her friends and not really talking to me. I would ask, and she would chalk it up to being stressed about us moving in together. I believed her, even if it felt like something else was up. Then, she decided that she wanted to have some time to herself to, ""Pack and get mentally ready for our move-in."" Again, I was okay with it, but it really bothered me, so we talked about it. This talk lead to us breaking up because she was so unhappy with the relationship. I was blind-sided to say the least. 
 So, we didn't talk for a few days, but we broke NC to get our stuff from each other and sort out some stuff for the house. I ended up asking her about this guy she had been mentioning a lot, and she broke down and told me about her cheating with him. Since then, I've been pretty miserable to say the least, and I'm finding it hard to even trust my family and friends.

"A few years ago I was ""baby-sitting"" with then girlfriend on new years, she had a 12-13 year old sister who wanted to have a party with a bunch of her friends. We agreed to chaperone (I was roughly 22 at the time). I'm an avid home-brewer, and we knew these kids would want to drink, so I hatched the plan. I bottled up a case of O'douls in my blank bottles, and also brought a case of my real beer (since me and the girl needed something to drink). The kids drank the near beer, we drank the adult beer, everyone was happy. We never told her sister or her friends that they weren't drunk, we just let them enjoy the party. We did let her parents know, and they thought it was pretty genius.

"Warning: Wall O' Text ahead - approach at your own risk. 
 So it's now officially been a week since I had my little guy (what?!) I finally have both of my hands free and my mind isn't racing (I'm a MOM?!) so I'll take the opportunity in between naps to share my story! 
 Last Monday (the 21st) I woke up and got out of bed to feel a small gush (not even really, it kind of felt like my period starting), I waddled to the bathroom and saw a couple of clear dribbles down my leg. I was pretty sure it wasn't pee, but I wasn't sure what it was and once I was done in the bathroom it stopped so I really wasn't sure what was going on. Did my amniotic sac rupture and I'm leaking? I don't know. I called the doctor and set me up with an appointment that afternoon. Clearly not a super rush on their end. I called work and did some work remotely till 12:30, when I started getting stronger contractions, but there was no rhyme or reason so I figured I was going to have another afternoon of false labor like I did the week before. 
 I called my doula and told her what was going on and she wanted to come to my doctors appointment with me (I should have read this as a sign that I was in for a long night) but I was still convinced I was just having false labor and nothing was going to happen. 
 At the doctors appointment we find out that I'm 3-4 centimeters dilated, that my water didn't break (it was probably just extra fluid...nice.) and the ob isn't sure if I'm ""at the very end of early labor or beginning of active labor"" then she says ""I'm the on call OB tonight, and I wouldn't be surprised to see you later"" At this point I'm still convinced that I'm going to get home and my contractions are going to stop. 
 My fiance, doula and I go for a walk around the park and I'm feeling pretty good through my contractions (which are getting more regular, but not any stronger - still like 15-20 minutes apart). 
 I tell my doula to go home because I don't think anything else is going to happen and my fiance and I go home (it's now about 3:30). We get home and an hour later my contractions really start to kick in. I call my doula back ""I'm sorry I just sent you home but you should probably come back now"". She gets to my house around 5:30 or 6 (I think, time starts getting pretty fuzzy at this point, I feel like I'm operating on a different plane of reality). My parents stop by and I barely remember - the contractions are about 7 minutes apart at this point. Around 8:30 we go to the hospital and they check me out and I'm 5-6 centimeters dilated. Moving/being on my back is something I'm really not keen on at this point and spend my contractions rocking back and forth on my feet draped over my fiance. They admit me and we go down to the room (this hospital has rooms where you labor/deliver/recover in the same room). I get in the tub for a little while - it was nice in between contractions, but not so nice during - I get out after about 3 or 4 (again, my recollection of timing here is not so great, I'm asking my fiance to help me remember). Oh and apparently my water broke in the tub, how convenient. The nurse brings me an inner tube to put my belly on to see if that helps - it doesn't. I get back to standing up on one side of the bed with my fiance on the other and the doula rubbing my back through each contraction and every time I think they're at their worst, they get even worse. At one point the OB came in and asked me about pain management. I was lucid enough to ask her if/how long it would prolong my labor and she gave me a really wishy/washy answer, so I looked her dead in the face and said ""Do you think I can do it without anything?"" and she looked at me and said ""Yes, I think you can. Based on what I've seen so far, I think you can."" So that was that. Nobody even mentioned anything after that point and I just trudged through. It. Was. Awful. Like seriously. At some point they came in and checked me and I was 9.5 centimeters and they told me I could start pushing if I felt like it. I did. I pushed and pushed and pooped and pushed some more. The nurse kept telling me to ""push like I'm having a bowel movement"" and I screamed back at her ""I'm trying to fucking poop!!!"" This I remember very clearly. Just as I thought I couldn't do it anymore my beautiful son was born at 12:52 AM and the first words out of my mouth after they put him on my chest were ""holy shit."" I still kind of feel like that. 
 He was a week and a day early and was 6 lbs 3 oz and 19.5"" - I'm really thankful that he was impatient because I didn't tear, the OB had to check 3 times, she was surprised. I'm eternally grateful because a week later I feel more myself than I did most of my pregnancy. Overall I'm really happy and thankful for my whole experience, I really don't think I could have done it without my fiance and my doula there with me.","First baby, lightning fast labor - got to hospital at 8:30 PM, baby was born at 1 AM.

"A little backstory: I started a web design company a few months ago after my hobby of site designing really started taking off. I've had a few clients here and there, but I have been in a really bad dry spell lately and was told by my parents (with whom I live), that I either need to find a 'real job' or start getting my business on the up and up. 
 I don't really have that much money left due to an unforseen expense with my vehicle, but I would really like to start finding ways to market myself (other than reddit, facebook, and craigslist). I understand in this industry a lot has to do with word-of-mouth, but there's got to be some way I can get started. I've heard tales in different places of people making a decent living doing this type of thing on their own. I'd like to be in that place as well.

"The biggest thing I started with was getting away from my poisonous ex-gf.  Next thing I did was lost quite a bit of weight by eating better and exercising more (young people make losing weight sound too difficult, you know how you just have to put in the effort).  I tried clearing up my acne which has never been too bad, pimples and blackheads here and there, but I have this weird kind of acne or something on my forehead that doesn't go away on my forehead.  I realized I am more than a forehead with acne, but more importantly, people just don't care (they can identify you by features such as these sometimes, but its rare to be made fun of for stuff like this, even behind your back after 18.  If you are younger than that you might get made fun of, but who cares).  Get made fun of, and roll with the punches, and punch right back (figuratively of course, and all in good fun). People love being around people who aren't all uptight and can have a good time.  If you don't talk to people regularly then do that.  I was always afraid off me having bad breath and again, people noticing my acne.  Brush your teeth, carry gum if need be, don't eat onions and remember, people are either focusing on their own flaws or your conversation, not your flaws.  Try wearing nicer clothes if you can, save the pokemon and sonic shirts for weekends at the bowling alley (I wish I could wear them more, but I'm trying to look more professional/adult now.). POSTURE, POSTURE, POSTURE.  Boys like when girls have great posture and girls LOVE when guys have great posture because that alone tells them you are fairly confident (have you walked on a sidewalk at school with your shoulders slumped and people walking three wide won't move out of your way? Its because your posture tells them you're a puss that will move.  Walk head up, chest out, shoulders back, and back straight and people will move for you!). Once you realize you are in control of yourself and someone else isn't, and neither is their perception of you, you will feel more confident. 
Quick side note, right after I made all those changes I started dating a sexy little mexican who made me feel much more valued as a human being than the previous ex.

"This is quite a long post, and I'm mainly just writing this because I don't really have any other place to post, mainly just a rant. I apologize about the massive wall of text.) 
 A large section of a background on me...I grew up in a divorced household where my parents shouted about me 24/7 and completely hated each other. My mom was engaged to this asshole who was a drunk and used to hit her all the time. By the time I was 11 I was already depressed because I was such a huge loser in school. It never really motivated me to try harder to either A. Make friends, or B. Change myself to try and make friends. 
 I never really got out of the depression when I went through Middle School, and it just got worse with High School. I went through so many changes, which of course was High School. I never really tried in high school because I never bothered and by that point I had moved into my dad's ""house"" well it was basically a trailer that absolutely disgusting and I had to deal with. He is/was mentally abusive and never really bothered to listen; and I never really had friends to vent to or even trust enough to confide in. The friends I did have got tired of me being depressed, and only kept maybe a few friends (which I rarely talk to and I just watch them become successful over Facebook, which I am happy for them) after I graduated. 
 I had a few relationships but they floundered so horribly because I was depressed, and I'm not sure why they even stayed with me for as long as they did. I thought I was being selfish so I wanted to change and I devoted myself to being selfless and helping my friends. But, I got lost along the way and stopped caring about what I needed...and I ended just being more depressed. 
 Sadly, I ended up getting sick (diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma, Stage IV) and honestly by that time...I wanted to die I felt that there was nothing more to even consider about living. But, because my mother had already suffered one child having cancer (My sister had ALL (Acute lymphoblastic leukemia) and was about 2 weeks before they diagnosed her from dying) she didn't want to even consider have me giving up. They forced me to get treatment because they felt that my mental state was not correct enough to make decisions...so they became my ""proctors"" (mother and father, this helped kind of restore their knowledge of each other existing) and I went through treatments. 
 During my treatments, I met this girl. She was...god so amazing. She became this beacon of hope and shining light that was ending my depression and causing me to be more confident in myself and I was in an okay state to stop having my parents being my proctors. I ended up falling in love with her...and I visited her, hell I even delayed Chemo and lied to my dad about skipping it. Well, when I visited her it was...nothing I expected. It was basically a farce of who she was and well, not what I expected. Sadly, I still wanted to be with her because well, it was the first girl I had ever talked to in quite awhile. And sadly...I went just a little nuts. I went into a huge fucking depression...way worse than I had ever been in before. So much so that I refused Chemo for about a month and a half and nearly caused my cathider to get infected. During that time, I was to get a CT scan and was actually tied to the scanning bed because I didn't want to continue. This was back in 2008-2009 
 Well, obviously as you can tell I am still here. I ended up going to college because I wanted to make a change..and well it didn't work out well. I was horrible at learning because my bad habits from Middle/High school popped up and continued to College. I was lazy, always making excuses about why I couldn't complete the school work and barely passing (most of my major classes were 70/75's (about a D or C in GPA) and was just wasting money with loans and anything else I got my hands on. 
 I had a few jobs but it's been retail positions...because what's better than being depressed? Being depressed and working retail...this went on for a few years until I was finally able to get a job at BioWare, which was awesome! So I moved out to that city and started my dream job, as I wanted to be a game developer as gaming has been the only constant that has helped me escape from everything. 
 Well sadly 3 months in I get laid off..and it's been pretty much downhill from there. I got a car before I left that was so nice..but I ended up totaling because I went too fast around a corner and skip when it was raining. 
 And now I have dropped my major for game development and picked up Business...which I have racked up nearly 100k in loans (financial aid cut off after awhile because I took too much) and in that 100k are 7k in hospital bills because I didn't have insurance when I got a kidney stone. 
 On top of that, I'm still overweight from my treatments back in 2008 (I had to gain a lot of weight because I was 125lbs when I started chemo as it had been eating away at my body, well the cancer did) and my teeth have rotted out and the only girl I have fallen in love with since that epic meltdown is one of my good friends that has no interest in me... 
 So basically...I don't have an excuse. I know 90% of this stuff is my fault and there's not a lot I can say that will make it better. I just wanted someone to read my story..even though I know it's not nearly what anyone else has been through on here and I honestly really considered ending it all because I was just done with all..constantly in debt, not getting anywhere with my job, and so alone that I don't even go out anymore.

"Hi ladies, I need your advice.
I'm not together with my girlfriend for about 1,5 years, and we are in a LDR (500 miles). I'm 25M, she's 27. She's my first girlfriend, and my past romances have been a joke, but I don't want to go too much in-depth about.
We've had our ups and downs, but sometimes I just feel like I'm alone. Not the ""We miss each other"" kind of alone thing, but wondering if there really is a spark, or if I'm just filling the space (figuratively and literally). 
 On our anniversary we couldn't be together, because of the distance and we had other obligations that stood in the way, so we called like we always do. I told her at the end that I love her and wished her a goodnight, and all I got was a ""yes, bye"". I don't ask for alot, and I don't think it's too much to hear ""I love you too"" back once in a while, especially on ""our"" day. It made me feel really stupid, and made me act immature by staying offline during the day, and let the phone ring when she called. It's a stupid move, but at the time it made me feel worse when I thought about picking up. 
 Eventually we talked about it, told her that it hurt me and that it certainly wouldn't hurt her to say it once in a while, especially on our day. It boiled down to that she thought that I just know it. We talked it out, she acknowledged it, and we went on.
Just yesterday I dropped her off at the airport and the same thing happens. I told her that I love her and that I will miss her, but she said little of it. I asked her if it somehow hurts her if she would say it, or just doesn't feel that way anymore. She replied that she does love me, but thinks she doesn't have to, since flying over so far just for me should be enough proof that she does. Again I told her that it's nice to hear it once in a while, it's something small that means alot to me, but this time I said it calmly, without crying like last time. When she arrived, I had to do some effort before I could kiss her and a hug seemed out of the question. This happens every time by the way, and the next day she is fine and seemingly can handle my cheesiness. 
 All my romance was considered to be cheesy, or just laughed off as ""Aww, I love you too"" in a pityful way like ""Alright, here you have it and lets move on with our day :D"". She thinks of herself as coldhearted, and if she says something that expresses a feeling towards me I have to keep it a secret because her friends can't know about her romantic expressions. We refer to each other to certain flully animals, and she has put that in her Kik-status with a heart in between, which is nice, but I doubt that anyone knows what it's really about. And I got a heart, which is nice, but sad if you consider that the ""romantic gesture well"" is already running empty, aswell as the glue that glues my heart together after each time I feel waved off when I try to be a BF. 
 I haven't talked to her thoroughly about this, and yes, I know I have to talk, but I want to hear some advices before I say or do something stupid. 
 I am getting the feeling that we are more like exclusive fuckbuddies, it makes me feel stupid and alone. It makes me wonder if I should just break up, or if this is what a relationship looks like in her area.
She was in a relationship with a guy before me (which is relevant), which was perfectly fine with me. Was, after she told me some details on how long they have been together and how they have broken up. Simply said, they were together for a couple of months and slowly the guy always had things to do when she tried to meet up, and the fire just burned out. I thought he was a douche at first, but the further we are in our relationship, the more I believe that he just maybe felt like me. Maybe she was just as cold to him as she is to me which also led him to feel alone, feel resentment and questioned their relationship. 
 What I want? I want to feel loved. I want to hear ""I love you"" once in a while, I want to look into each others eyes and just smile like idiots, I want a random hug, and especially a tight one with a kiss with feeling when we get together or part again. Any kisses, or other physical things are 90/10 initiated by me, the other 10 are probably initiated by her guilt feeling. Interestingly she does show affection when I'm just not in the mood or something is really bothering me, as to try to keep me distant, but pull me back when I'm too far away... It's like the friendzone, but the fuckbuddy zone. I know....doubt.... she loves me and just acts distant for whatever the reason, but this is what I miss... 
 Is it me? Is it her? Us? Please, advice me how I should approach this.","Girlfriend is isn't into romance it seems, it's making me feel stupid and alone. I want to talk about it and fix it, or break up. I cried as I wrote this :(",25,M,askwomenadvice
"I was 16 and just finished high school. I go down to Devon (South England) with a friend and we have a few beers. My friend is 21 and no stranger to brothels. After most places close (given it's a Tuesday or Thursday, forgive me, this was a while ago) we are walking back to my hotel. 
 Two blokes are in the middle of the road and give us some directions to somewhere where can 'have a fun time'. My friend walks there with an odd sense of confidence, as if he has been there before. We reach the destination- what appears to be a run down terrace house. However, upon entering, I realise what is going on. 
 Two  gorgeous  women greet us at the door. I have no money at this point, nor does my friend. Enter a 6 ft 6 Russian man, in lots of Armani clothes and gold jewellery- scars on his face, drinking scotch- glaring at me expressionlessly. My friend runs out, to the nearest cash point to get some money. I am drunk, excited and completely scared. At this point I am sitting on a massive double bed, in a room filled with silk, suede and leather finishings. This place is nicer than my house. 
 Re enter my friend, with some cash. I hear his voice- him being in the entrance, me in a bedroom. He walks into the room I am in and begins to undress. I ask him what the fuck he is doing, beginning to ponder the thought we will be robbed. He tells me to undress, I ask why... And then walks in my reason. One of the stunning girls who greeted us. Turns out my mate only had enough for a 40 minute threesome. 
 We get down to business (I am deliberately skipping the nitty gritty details) and 10 minutes in to spit roasting this girl, my friend leaves the room. Flaccid. 
 I have the remaining 30 minutes by myself. I am not going to claim it was cute and sweet or I genuinely pleasure her because I was a drunk 16 year old. Nevertheless, it was awesome for me. Free sex with the hottest girl I will ever meet. 
 After I finished, I put my purple headed yoghurt slinger away and get dressed. My friend re enters, at this point it is just he and I in the room. He proceeds to urinate  everywhere .

 I worked in mcdonalds from i was 16 for 7 years. I am a self taught web programmer. Everything i do is in php/html/js and a few speckles of node/scala. 
 With no development jobs in my local town and no real opportunities to develop my skills, i decided one day to go freelance. I had no idea how i was going to get work but i handed in my notice and left mcdonalds which in retrospect may have been the worst and best decision ever. 
 I got very little work in the first few months- i had the benefit of living with my parents and struggled. I was mainly pushing facebook apps built using php or something similar. No one else in my area was doing it so it became my USP. 
 I eventually got in contact with a guy in another country who had a pipeline of projects with big brand names. We done projects every 2 months or so but they where sizeable to keep me going. Eventually one of those projects got financed to be turned into a business. 
 Now two years later the business got started, we are in line to do probably around 1mill USD  having done about 600k USD last year. I now fulfil the CTO and head of product dev roles and we are still a small team thats trying to ramp up. 
 I am vesting for equity in the business

"PSA: Not got a whole lot to lose? Start exercising from day 1. 
 I inadvertently performed a little experiment on myself re: Exercising
vs. Not Exercising. The “control” was doing SAD and exercise for the duration of a 45 lb loss in 2008, going from 167 to 122. After 7 months I looked fabulous at 129, with toned arms and a stomach flat enough to pull form fitting t-shirts down past the waistband of my jeans without any muffin top. 
 After having put most of that weight back on, this time around I decided to do keto, and have gone from 160 to 129 in 4 months, almost half the time it took me four years ago. Amazing for a petite, not super overweight woman, right? Right. Go me. 
 But. 
 It is easy for almost anyone with a high bodyfat percentage to lose weight on keto very quickly without exercising. However, you will pay for it when you are close to your ideal weight and nowhere near as attractive looking as you’d expected to be. This is the price you pay for your number vanity. 
 I was so fixated on the scale reading changing quickly that I didn’t exercise at all, in hopes of winning some race to the 129 finish line, where I told myself I’d finally start exercising. Now, I’m left
looking about 15 lbs heavier than I did at the same weight the last time around. Talk about discouraging. 
 If anything, the consistent low-level frustration that I, a lazy person, would have experienced by making myself to go to the gym this whole time is way less overwhelming than the condensed and desperate frustration I am experiencing now. I compare it to running most of a marathon in under three hours, only to spend an hour running the hundred yards to cross the finish line. 
 Pace yourself. Start going to the gym now.","Future you will be really pissed at current you for leaving all the hard work and frustration till the very end. Yes, keto is easy, but that doesn’t give you license to be lazy.",35,F,keto
"So, a little more than a month ago I applied for this detention center located just outside of the city I live in. According to a few friends of mine who work there, they are super shorthanded and are in dire need of more detention officers; to the point where current officers are working 7 days a week and almost 14 hour shifts just to make up for what they don't have. Since I was 15 years old, I'm 21 now, I've wanted to pursue law enforcement. When I was 17 years old, I enrolled in my first law enforcement academy at my local community college that totaled 158 hours. Once I graduated that, I signed up for the Corrections Academy the next semester, which totaled 176 hours. I felt good about myself, knowing that I had two certificates to show for. I was 18, almost 19 by this time. You'd think that'd be enough experience to have for any police department or correctional facility to be throwing the job at you, but I decided to endure a THIRD academy. This one was a little more prestigious because it was through the County Sheriff's Department. I suffered another painstaking 80 hours just to build myself a higher reputation for my intended career choice. Not only did I graduate this one too, but I graduated at the top of my class as the Class Sergeant. I gained a lot of respect from numerous different authorities including District Attorneys! All that being said, I submitted my application to the detention center with my resume attached and I still haven't received anything at all. No emails, no letters, no calls; nothing. I've called twice to check the status of my app, and all they've told me was that they don't give out any information regarding employment, and that it's all through their corporate office. I'm hoping I receive something soon.",I have 3 law enforcement/correctional certificates and haven't been hired by local detention center that claims to be shorthanded.,21,M,AskReddit
"I say you need to grow up because you use flagrantly ignorant language. Do you want to be an adult? If yes, then you should type and speak like one. If not, shut the fuck up and accept that being twelve years of age makes you a child, because if you are not a twelve, you have a lot more growing up to do before you can all yourself mature, or any word close to ""mature"" in meaning. 
 And if the useless downvotes come in, I shall say this; I am 24, and I currently am the primary caregiver to my four youngest siblings. I know the real world, and I know maturity.

"Well, I died for 28 minutes then I died 6 more times in the hospital. I remember that the recovery was unimaginably painful, (really, all my brain remembers is that it sucked. I can not even imagine something that I felt.) 
 I do not remember that whole week and my memory for the following two months is very spotty, so i can not tell you what it is like. 
 I was hit  directly  on the front of my body and have numerous entrance and exit wounds that are all keloid now. 40% was 3rd degree, 20% was 2nd degree, and the rest was 1st degree. No lichtenburg, just a fuck-ton of keloid. 
 I have been recovering for about 2 years and 3 months. The first month was treating burns; second month was relearning how to sit up, eat, get dressed, transfer to a wheel chair, and relearning how to barely walk, (for around the house and further training. 
 The next four months was everyday physical and occupational therapy for three hours a day. After that I would go receive an experimental pain treatment for my neuropathy, (from the lightening, not preexisting.) the treatment was, ironically, using electricity to trick my brain into thinking I was okay by mimicking the ""everything is fine,"" signal that nerves usually send. I would then go home and mope in pain and sit with my girlfriend, (now separated.) I went on Good Morning America during march. 
 The next 6 months was roughly the same as the first four, but I shifted from walking to running in PT and OT was focused on getting me graduated and prepped for college work. I was also only going twice a week instead of every day. Pain persisted through whole summer. Almost attempted suicide in mid-June by pulling the trigger on a loaded gun. I am alive because a preservative called cosmoline jammed-up the firing-pin and it did not strike the primer hard enough. (gun was a Mosin Nagant, if you know anything about them, then that will explain the cosmoline.) the Saturday before school started in August, I separated from my girlfriend. 
 Since then it has just been college and trying to get my hands working because the fingers do not work, (I chicken peck or use my iPad.) I have been using neural feedback therapy to try and get them working again. i probably should have mentioned that the pain is only in my arms and mostly under control now.

"I've been dating this girl, long distance (I'm in FL, she's in Japan) and its been going great. She loved me so much, she is the Ideal woman. She is sweet, kind, very very good manners, very respectful, careful when driving, would make an excellent mother. and of course, amazingly beautiful.We talked daily for 1-2hr over LINE ( like skype) I live at home with my parents, because I have no need for otherwise. They leave me alone, they will retire in a year so I'll move out then. I have 18/hr job and a Vespa scooter. This provides me with lots of extra $$ that I use for travel and other stuff. I go to college and will graduate in about 1yr, I pay 100% of the tuition so I owe no loans. 
 We do have some problems, there is some language barrier, combined with my hearing damage makes for a lot of misunderstandings. She has little confidence in herself, low self esteem and such. I've managed to fix some but I think she needs professional help. There are other minor things that I find missing in her. She will not dance anything, she cannot be ""sensual"" she's kind of plain. She comes from a rural area of Japan, she's not your Tokyo-anime-girl so there is some reason for her way of being. 
 She also has the tendency to over investigate and ask things. I tried to leave my past in the past but she keeps asking me and digging, and then confronts me when I did something wrong in the past. This is hurtful because sometimes I've been to X-place or Y- restaurant with another girl and she will then avoid said place, even if nice and romantic. If you think of it, then eventually there is NO place for us to go that may contain a memory of someone else years in the past. 
 Our relationship has not been perfect because of me. When we met, I didnt feel much commitment, and I tried to cheat, she caught some messages, we broke up but I ended up not doing it. I felt like garbage, and eventually visited her in Japan, where I spent 2 weeks traveling and sort of got together again. 
 When I went to Korea after Japan, we were in a ""limbo"" of relationship status. I took advantage of this and tried to get laid with every hot chick I met. I ended up with 2 prostitutes. 
 I didn t tell her about this, we got back together. I visited her again this past Christmas for 2 weeks. All was well. But when I came back to FL I was thinking of just so many more things I could do if I wasn't with her. So many places I want to visit, so many other women to meet and ""socialize"". I  want go out and about, without having to worry about hurting her. I want to be free. I'm still young and I if I decide to do stupid shit, which some may find reckless or irresponsible, I dont want to do it while betraying and lying to someone. While chatting with someone on Fb, she sugested I should break up. I thought ""yeah I'll do it next time we fight"" but that took too long, she bought a ticket and came here. I was a coward and didnt tell her not to come. 
 So recently it came out ( trough her over-questioning and poking at the past) What I had done. Of course she was not happy. We broke up halfway trough her vacation here, she got mad, punched me so much her fist became bruised, cried etc. She still has 5 more days here. I paid for her hotel and even offered her to drop her at the airport so she could go home right away and I would pay any flight change fees, ( she said it would raise too many questions why she was home early from her trip). 
 However, She still had feelings for me, she stills wants me, She is everything any man could possible dream of. I find no reason to break up with her, except the things I want to do cannot be done ""morally"" while in a relationship. Yesterday was the final straw when I told her I chose a future without her. She called me an asshole for the first time, I've NEVER heard her swear, much less in English. This morning I found the ring I gave her on my phone ( we have a 2 bed room...yes its kind of awkward). 
 Thats why I said "" loved"" and ""had"" feelings. Because I pretty much ended all hopes for her yesterday. Even she offered to change her questioning ways, and tried to fit my life ( I told her I make barely enough to have apartment maybe car payments and live by myself, but I would not be able to travel if I had those things. I wouldn't have enough $$ for anything else in my life except ""live""). I simply said I  wanted to do other things in my life and she said she felt like a ""burden"" to me.... 
 So my question is: 
1)Am I doing the right thing? 
 2)Am I throwing a golden opportunity down the toilet? 
 3)will I regret this for the rest of my life? 
 4)is it realistic to find a person to marry at 31 or 32 later in my life? 
 5)Should I give up on stupid childish party lifestyle? 
 6)am I too old for that shit? 
 7)WTF should I do.... I can still save her and change my life and stay with her.","I want to break up with my Gf because I want to travel party and bang hot young chicks, but I'm not sure if its the right choice because my Gf is such an amazing person",20,M,relationship_advice
"Using a throwaway because I would like this to remain anonymous.. 
 Story:
Met the summer before high school.  Different high schools, mutual friends, hung out all the time.  When we were 15/16 respectively, we lost our virginity together.  We had regular, teenage (bad) sex.  After a while I naturally started to get the hang of it and really enjoy making love.  I started to feel more adventurous, but she was always very shy and reserved.  That said, outside of our sex life, I was still attracted to her.  She's an extremely sweet person, exceptionally selfless...a great counterpart. 
 I didn't go to college to pursue other avenues.  Even though she went locally, we broke up for her first couple semesters because she wanted to experience college.  Fast forward to the end of her first year: we were back together, and sleeping together, for about a year(ish?).  At this point, not too much had changed...still having regular sex, although it was ALWAYS initiated by me.  I'd always be leading the way.  But I definitely remember, even this early on, feeling like I wished she would take control and just fuck me.  Or just be more deviant in general. 
 So at this point, I was 18 and decided that it would be good to be single for a couple of reasons.  1) I was traveling a lot, meeting lots of new people (see: girls) who I was fantasizing about...and I was in a position to have a reason to flirt with all of them... and 2) Despite a deep love for her, I had a fear of hitting a certain age and realizing I never once tried to love/meet/date anyone else...because I didn't want to look back and think I may have missed out.  After all, how likely is it that someone you meet when you are 13 years old is ""the one""? 
 I spent a little while on the road barely keeping up with her.  Occasionally texting every now and then.  Then eventually resumed an amicable relation/friendship.  I always had feelings for her, even if they were suppressed. 
 In those two years, not too sound cocky, I met a decent amount of girls.  I wasn't hooking up with girls every night.  But I did sleep around a bit, and certainly fooled around and/or just flirted with as many more.  I realized around this time that I just flat out love physical intimacy with women.  they were too hard to deny.  I accepted that I just love that raw sense of natural being during sex.  I got with girls a bit older than me, too, which were experiences that further fueled my fire.  Nothing ever built to be more than just fun, lighthearted sex.  Even when it was physically rough, it was all lighthearted. 
 I moved back home in 2011, when I was 20 (she was 21).  Didn't start ""dating"" right away.  But at this point our friendship and connection was years old and ran pretty deep.  I realized that she hadn't moved on from me.  I still don't know if she slept with or hooked up with people.  Didn't care, never asked.. We started sleeping together again...been together ever since. 
 So, since then...not much is changed in regards to her sexual being.  I'm still always initiating foreplay/sex.  And even though I always make the best out of it, often I've felt unsatisfied...I long for her to initiate sex, or take control in some way. 
 With some girls, I've been so turned on when they walk into the room and let me know somehow (without words...usually) ""i am going to fuck you, you are going to fuck me back, and it will be magical"" -- i never experience that with my girlfriend. 
 During foreplay, to try and get her to take initiative I'll say things like ""you look so sexy, undress for me"", or ""i want you so bad, show me you want me, too"" -- or i don't know...sometimes not even hints at her taking control.  I would say things to simply let her know I thought she was turning me on, and that i wanted her.  although even when she obliges, it feels forced and very unsexy altogether because i had to request it of her.  like forcing her to do something she didn't want to do, almost. 
 Eventually I figured I just needed to start flat out telling her the things that are bothering me with our sex life.  So I've said things as honest as, ""sometimes I really wish you would be the one to initiate sex with me"", or ""sometimes i feel like I'm turned on by you more than you're turned on by me"", or ""sometimes i want to be taken control of, but you seem uninterested""....this is always greeted with a deflated, surprised and melancholy response from her. 
 She is a petite girl, with a great physical figure.  I find her very sexy.  I wonder lately if maybe she doesn't find herself sexy, and that plays into it?  Maybe she's just not as sexual of a being as I am? 
 I haven't cheated on her, but I am now very consistently fantasizing about other girls.  This bit is particularly sad, but I've been having flashbacks of some of the better sex I've had with people I know FAR less than I know my gf. 
 Also worth noting is that she climaxes regularly.  And very often, especially lately, says things like ""god you're so good at this"" or ""every time...how are you so good at this?"" -- and it breaks my heart that my internal response is becoming...""BUT WHY AREN'T YOU GOOD AT THIS?!"" 
 I'm just very torn and don't know how to proceed.  I can't imagine breaking up with her over this.  But I also can't imagine staying with her if I'm just regularly fantasizing about fucking other girls (very, very regularly)... 
 1) What do I do?
2) Am I in the wrong, for wanting more?","I've loved a girl my entire teenage and early adult life.  Dated on and off.  Have had sex with other people.

"So myself (21) and my boyfriend (21) have been seeing each other for about 5 months now. When we first started seeing each other it was a friends with benefits kind of situation and he made it very clear he had no intention of dating me. He had just broken up with his ex and seemed really into her still (i.e. - her picture was still the background of his phone) but I didn't want to date him either so I was ok with that. However, I quickly learned I was really into him but didn't want to seem clingy so bottled up all the feelings of jealousy towards her and never told him about it.
Fast forward 5 months and things seem really good, pictures of his ex are gone and he finally asks me out. But not two weeks later I got completely black out drunk and kissed someone else completely screwing things up. I honestly have no idea why I did it, I have never cheated before and never had any intention to as I was really loved him. Later that night when I sobered up and he told me what happened he got really upset and said he loved me for the first time and ended up even proposing (which I said yes to). We spent the next two days together and talked about the fact that we were engaged and kept doing things like call me his wife.
Once he went back home though he blew up at me and said he never wanted to see me again and he deserved better. All I could do was apologize, I was black out drunk but I fully took responsibility for the fact that I drank that much (this has NEVER happened to me before and I never plan to have it happen again). He didn't seem to want to hear any of it so I left him alone. About a week later he contacted me and we started talking again.
Once we hung out we ended up hooking up and he said he wanted to try again and make things work. Now he never said whether that meant we were dating again but I assumed we were kind of going through a trial period so I didn't really want to mention it. He came to visit me this past weekend (I'm assuming as a bit of a trial) and I discovered that the background to his phone is of his ex-gf again. He put all the old pictures of her back on his phone and all 3 of his backgrounds are of her. I understand deleting the pictures of me but I don't understand why he had to put old ones of her back on. Now I'm really uncomfortable with this but I don't know what to do. I really want things to work out but I don't know how or when to approach him about this. Do I wait and see if we get back together (although it feels like we already have) or do I tackle it right away. It just really hurts to see her picture, I feel like I am constantly being compared to her.","Started seeing someone as a fwb, turned out I really liked him.

"Updated with aggregated advice from comments over the past few hours (mostly for my benefit). Thanks everyone! 
 
 Increase protein to 180g/day, if possible with real foods 
 Protein/creatine on weekends too! Recovery vital 
 More sleep (unlikely!) 
 Reduce calorie in-take to 1700 (i'm still high bf% and don't need the extra calories yet) 
 More accuracy! Food scale, calipers and measuring tape for BF%, body weight fluctuations likely from increase water weight from creatine 
 Better tracking, weekly status photos in conjunction with more accurate weigh ins. Maybe body fat assessment only once per week with normal weigh ins on daily basis. 
 Don't worry too much about weight ratios. This will sort itself out once I plateau on my gains 
 Next gym trip reassess my current weight levels (skipped initially at trainer's recommendation) 
 Cheat days, eat healthy breakfast/lunch if possible, phase in healthy habits gradually 
 Power cleans! add em. 
 
 
 Hi /r/fitness, I've been following the SS program as best as can, but I wanted a 2nd, 3rd, etc pair of eyes to look over my routine/nutrition to help point out any glaring mistakes I might be making, and to give me some feedback on how to proceed in the coming weeks. 
 My first day of starting strength was about 3 weeks ago on April 15. I am 5'8"", 25 year old male. On April 15, I weighed in at about 215lbs with an estimated body fat percentage of 26% (possibly highly inaccurate as I only have one of those digital scales). I weighed myself today and I was at about 223 lbs with an estimated 27.5% body fat percentage. 
 Following the Practical Programming Novice 2nd Edition, I leave out power cleans when I started. 
 Lifts 
 Starting: 
 
 Squats: 3x5 45lbs 
 Press: 3x5 45lbs  
 Bench Press: 3x5 45lbs 
 Dead lift: 1x5 45lbs 
 
 Cardio (days between workouts 2-3 times a week):
treadmill or elliptical, 30 minutes about 2.5-3.5 miles.
elliptical miles tend to be inflated more. 
 Today: 
 
 Squats: 3x5 115lbs 
 Press: 3x5 85lbs  
 Bench Press: 3x5 125lbs 
 Dead lift: 2x5 125lbs 
 Pull Up (Negatives) 1x5 
 
 Nutrition 
 When I started, I looked up on some diet calculators that I need 2200 calories sedentary lifestyle to maintain my 215 weight. I started at a caloric deficit because at 26% bodyfat, I thought I'd be in the category of people that are overweight who can still burn fat and build muscle simultaneously. I generally kept my calorie limits within 1600-1900 Mon-Fri and ate and drank whatever on weekends. 
 2nd week I paid more attention to my protein intake. I added 2-3 scoops ON Gold Whey, along with a scoop of ON Creatine, and a tablespoon of Konsyl for some fiber to my post workout.  I think I'm getting around of 150 grams of protein a day but it's not 100% precise as I do a mix of eatting lunch out and cooking. Around this time I did some more reading about SS and nutrition specifically, and I decided to increase my caloric intake to about 2600 a day (about 500 above what my 2200 sedentary requirement is) 
 Weekends, I don't monitor my caloric intake at all, and will typically eat and drink whatever I want. Go out with friends and coworkers to bars, get drunk, all that good stuff. I don't eat and drink to excess for the sake of being off my diet, but I will go out and have a good time. 
 Results Interpretation 
I have no clue. I started at 215lbs and am 223lbs now. My gym has one of those scales that have a sliding bar which I'm told is more accurate, I might switch from my home digital scale to that one. I'm certainly still on the big side, though my pants in terms of waist size feel like they fit a bit better (less snug) than when I started. I thought that maybe part of the weight increase might be due to my muscles retaining more water from the creatine. On the whole, because of the protein/creatine/fiber shake in the morning (16-20oz water), I also think I'm a lot better hydrated than I was before. 
 In terms of my lifts, I started with just the bar for a week because I was worried about injuring myself and having proper form. I was pretty weak just starting out, fortunately my gym owner was really cool and guided me my first 2-3 workouts to help me with my form. I realize the overhead press is my weakest point now. I'm following his suggested weight progression, but preses always feels a bit shaky when I try to increase weight for that. I need to get started on power cleans, but I haven't made it early enough to the gym in the morning to have the gym owner show me how to do them properly. I've watched the videos and read up on it, I just feel uncomfortable trying them out on my own.","questions 
 
 Weight from 215-223lbs @ 2600 cal (150g protein) over 3 weeks, I don't think this is mostly muscle, might be fat, should I alter my nutrition? 
 
 Press lift lagging behind my other lifts, should I continue my linear progression on the other lifts while letting the drag behind, or should I maintain everything else at my current level until Presses catch up? 
 
 Power Cleans, I will be introducing them into my workouts soon, similar question to Presses, do I start at just the bar only, and slowly ramp it up on its own pace, or do I stall progression on the other ones until power cleans catch up? 
 
 For my cheat/off days, I get drunk and eat whatever (not to crazy excess), if my progression is funny, should I look into moderating these off days a bit more or are my results so far good for 3 weeks? 
 
 For my deadlifts, I do 2 sets because I can complete the first set with relative ease, but don't want to jump ahead and increase the weight too much out of line of what the program recommends. Should I just bump up the weight or continue doing my 2 sets?

"A little background -- My girlfriend and I have been in what I though was an extremely healthy relationship that alternated between long stretches of not seeing eachother and long stretches of seeing eachother almost every day. We first met in highschool and were ""talking"" but nothing ever came of it. I left for college and she stayed home. We kept in touch very loosely over the next 6 years with the occasional text or social media post every couple of months. 
 Last winter break, while we were both home (me in law school and her at her undergrad) I asked her out on a date. I don't really know why I did this because I hadn't seen her in so long but for some reason she popped into my head when I was given tickets to this event. We went together and ended up sleeping together for the first time. After about another month or so we became official and just as we did she went back for her final semester of school.
Her school was ~4 hours away I made trips to see her every 2-3 weeks or so. She also made an effort to come and see me which she did a number of times during the semester. Surprisingly, even with the stressors of law school and all the struggles of a long distance relationship I actually performed even better my second semester and ended up making the Dean's list. She landed a great job starting in August which will require her to travel a lot and once again their HQs are a ways away (~3hrs). Despite this, I thought we were very happy and we would always talk about the future. We were a team. She was my best friend. Her family took me in and treated me like I was one of their own. Her sister felt like one of my sisters. Her mom felt like another mom. I would go to family gatherings and parties with them. I became close with the grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins. They were like family to me. 
 Yesterday, my girlfriend started crying while we were on a walk with my dog. She said, ""I don't want to be with you anymore"". I was completely lost for words. I didn't even start crying right away. My first question was ""where is this coming from?"". I think I went into a sort of shock. She just started crying more so we went back to my place and sat down across from each other. She said that she doesn't want to feel guilty about not being able to call me before bed and that she doesn't want me to worry about her. She said its not fair for me to be worried about her. She said that she felt like instead of her going for her own dreams that her dreams were changing to adapt to me. I told her that I still have similar dreams as to when I started but they aren't static. I told her that my end goal of becoming successful one day and raising a family has always remained the same but the the lens that I see it through has changed slightly. That dream now included her right by my side. She says we want different things. She would always talk about moving to Europe one day and making enough money to travel the world. I always told her how amazing that sounded and we would talk about it frequently. We held each other for maybe 5-10 minutes and then she left. I went to my bedroom and broke down. 
 I know this is all very fresh but I don't know what to do. I made fostered so many relationships over the past 7 months with people that we both knew. We had a lot of similar friends and being from the same hometown everyone knew we were dating. We were  the  couple that made it work after moving away and coming back home.

"Okay first off, a little back story. 
 I'm not gay but my best friend is. (I'm a female) I met him when I was 22 and he was 16 so we've been friends for about five years now. 
 When I met him, we clicked immediately. For a long time we had this wicked intense codependent relationship (which probably wasn't very healthy) and we seriously could not be separated for anything. 
 I was there when he came out to his family and I made sure that they all knew that I was behind him 100%. Most of his family was fine with it except his mother who completely flipped shit. She started treating him like hell and he was staying at my apartment more and more to get away from her. She would tell him he couldn't eat there or that if he wanted school clothes then he should ask one of his boyfriends. Just really immature things. 
 I started taking care of him like he was my little brother. He was already pretty much family to me and I knew his situation so I didn't mind helping him get school clothes, or helping him pack lunches and stuff. I gave him dinner every night and I would take him out and do things with him. 
 It got to the point where I was more like a mother to him than his own mother was and he pretty much lived with me. I took care of everything that he needed and told him I would do so as long as he promised to graduate high school. I bought him a cell phone, clothes, and whatever else he needed or wanted. 
 Well we stayed super close for a long time. One of his boyfriends tried to break our friendship up because he thought that my friend would cheat on him with me (which still confuses me because I'm a girl and he's gay. smh) and to a degree it worked because he made me so uncomfortable when I would go to their apartment that I slowly stopped going over. It all came to a head when his boyfriend lied to him about me and he said some extremely nasty things to me about my boyfriend. 
 Fast forward about two years and they had broken up. We started hanging out again more and more but it wasn't like it used to be. I understand that our friendship before was a little too much and we were so clingy because of our situations but he kept trying to be how we used to be. We tried and failed multiple times and I told him that we just needed to get to know eachother again because we had both grown up and were different people. 
 That seemed to work, and he started dating this amazing guy who I absolutely loved. I started hanging out with them more and more because it wasn't like hanging out with my friend and his boyfriend, it was me hanging out with these two amazing guys who I adored. We had a ton of fun whenever we were together and I was happy with the friendship again. I loved them and they loved me. 
 Unfortunately their relationship didn't work out. I stayed friends with both of them since it was a clean breakup and they were basically just trying to take time away from eachother for a while. 
 When his ex moved away, my friend ended up dating someone new. That's where my question comes into play. 
 Now around 6 months ago I finally found a job. I had been trying to get a job for about a year after college and even though it wasn't a great job, it was a paycheck. Well My friend lives about 5 minutes away from where I would be working and since I didn't have a car I called him and asked him if he could meet me where my sister in law worked (about 10 minutes away) and then drop me off at work. 
 I got there at about 8am (I didn't have to work until 6pm) so I told him if he wanted we could spend the day together and hang out so I could get to know his new boyfriend and he agreed so they came and picked me up. 
 About 20 minutes into me being there his boyfriend starts acting really weird and tells us he's leaving. At first I thought that he was just uncomfortable around me because he didn't really know me so I told my friend to call him and ask him to come back to hang out with us. When he called him his boyfriend said no and that it seemed like we needed time to ourselves. 
 I said Okay but I didn't really think too much into it at the time. We left and I bought him dinner and gave him some gas money. He dropped me off at work a little later and told me he'd pick me up when I was done to drive me back to where my sister in law worked. 
 At the end of my shift I called him and he told me he was on his way. I told him that work asked me to come back the next morning, and I asked him if he could pick me up in the same place because he had to work a half hour after I did. (So he would have had more than enough time to get to work since he worked about a mile away) 
 I heard his boyfriend say ""You tell her no."" and he goes ""Oh, sorry. I can't"" So I said okay and then I saw them pull in. 
 I get into the car and his boyfriend turns around and goes ""If it were up to HIM then he'd come get you but I told him no. You don't need to be using him like this. If you really want a ride you can give us 20$ for gas and not 14$. I can't believe that he lets you use him like this."" 
 I was completely shocked. I started to cry a little bit because I could not understand what I did wrong. he only had to drive about 10 miles to pick me up and take me back PLUS I bought him dinner and gave him my LAST 14$ for gas. 
 I asked him what he meant by me using my friend and he told me that he's sick of people using my friend for rides everywhere. I kept looking at my friend and waiting for him to defend me but he didn't say a word. I took care of him for two years and paid for everything he needed and wanted. I paid his phone bill, and his car insurance, and for his gas so when his boyfriend said that I used him I couldn't even believe it. It was even worse when my friend didn't speak up on my behalf. 
 That night I texted him and asked him why he didn't stick up for me and he told me he didn't know. He also said his boyfriend told him that he thinks I'm in love with him. (I'm already in love with someone who definitely is NOT my gay best friend.) 
 It's been a while since all of this happened and he's still with that guy. I've sucked it up more than once to go see him and hang out but it's really hard with his boyfriend constantly accusing me of things and saying things to me. 
 I'm not sure what to do anymore. I love this kid like he's my little brother and I'd do anything for him. I would never make him choose between me and any of his boyfriends. Not ever. I just wish I knew how I could make this work. 
 I'm sorry that this is so long and I wasn't completely sure if this was the right place. I kind of ended up ranting my way through it, and if you took the time to read it then thank you so much.

"I think you sound like a mangina. I am 41, my wife is almost 40. On the whole we have a great sex life - between 3-6 times per week and long sessions when we can. 
 Thing is this. When I married my wife part of what I promised was monogamy and exclusivity and I wore the opportunity cost. In return my wife promised to care about me and my (sexual) fulfilment. Of course there are plenty of reasons why sometimes we can't fuck but communication around these will almost always avoid heartache and that is cool. 
 But there is no way in hell I am gonna resign myself to an ebbing sex life like you clearly have. To me your wife just sounds lazy, complacent and uncaring. Sure, if you are happy with that then more power to you, but I never would be. The bottom line for me would be either she took my needs and desires seriously and responded appropriately including showing a little fucking enthusiasm and reciprocation or else I would go elsewhere for some younger, tighter and moister puss.","Bitch is complacent and needs to feel that there may well be some competition out there if she refuses to lift her game.

"Hi all, I x-posted this to /r/SRSWomen, but just as I was checking reddit before bed, I found this sub and thought I could also find some answers here! 
 So first: the facts. I am a 23 year old cis woman. I always thought I was heterosexual, although I never had a whole lot of experience with guys until about 3 years ago, when I met my boyfriend, a straight cis man, and I love him very much, and am very attracted to him. 
 About year before I met him, a (cis female, hetero-identifying) friend and I got very drunk and did some sexual stuff. The next day, we laughed it off, and our friendship is fine, and I never felt any lasting attraction towards her, so I assumed it was just a drunken experience that was interesting, but sort of confirmed that I was more interested in men. 
 But lately, I don't know why, but the past few weeks I just have this little nagging doubt at the back of my mind: am I bisexual? I kept dismissing it, because the thing is, I am not explicitly attracted to any particular woman right now. It's not like I am attracted to anyone outside of my hetero relationship. I don't want to leave my boyfriend to experiment with my sexuality, because a) I love him and want to be with him, and b) what if I experimented, and then discovered that I wasn't attracted to women after all? 
 I just... OK, I know I'm struggling to get to the point here. I don't even know if I have a point. I just feel so confused, where I've always been so sure before. I don't know who I am, and while I know that sexuality does not define a person, and does not fit into neat little boxes, I want to be able to define myself as something. Because I always defined myself as hetero, and now I find myself feeling some lack of identity. 
 And I don't know who to talk to about this, or even if I want to. I mean, is there any point telling my friends or my boyfriend, if I intend to stay in a relationship with him? I'm happy being with him, I'm attracted to him, so telling him/ my friends something like this might just cause unnecessary drama, I don't know. I mean, do I have to ""come out""? Or is it unnecessary? 
 I'm so sorry. I'm just so full of questions and doubts, and I needed to get this all off my chest. I'm just so confused, and I've never felt this kind of confusion before, and I'm getting really upset by it. And I don't know why this has come on so suddenly, almost out of nowhere. If anyone has any words of advice, they would be very much appreciated.","after 23 years of thinking I was straight, I feel like I might also be attracted to women. But I don't know if I am.

"Dammit; my time to shine, the vast majority of these were in place until I graduated high school at 16 and left the country to live on my own until I was 18. After I returned they attempted to enforce the rules to no avail so they kicked me out penniless on the street. 
My 23 yo brother still lives with them under these rules but he is borderline autistic and needs some of them.
1) I couldn't eat anything in the house without asking first and was usually told no unless it was served to me as meal.
2) 1 hour of computer/video games (nothing violent or over E rating) a day tops. Including school work.
3) Couldn't talk to my girlfriend on Yahoo chat or call her or text her. 
4) phones downstairs and off by 7pm all txts were monitored and had to be explained
5) no use of the car. ever.
6) had to tell them every time i went somewhere/they had to know where I was at all times. Suppose by some stroke of luck I went to a friends house (better not be caught playing video games) then we wanted to walk to the corner store. I had to call my mom ask permission and if i didn't i was being deceitful and lying. Generally speaking, if we did anything she didn't know about or remember, we were intentionally deceiving her. This caused the most problems.
7) no locked or closed doors, bathroom bedroom whatever. If it is closed or locked we were hiding something and being deceitful.
8) being homeschooled, if we had our hands in our pockets or were fucking with our belt or shirt or were ""distracted"" by some article of clothing, we had to take it off. Trying to do math in the basement classroom in the middle of winter in Detroit? Better not try to fix your twisted pants or they were coming off for the rest of the day. 
 Bonus addition. If she was yelling at us and tried to hit us and we (being trained in martial arts) tried to block or caught her wrists, she would scream louder and tell us to let her hit (slap) us. I blocked and countered once when I was like 13, not hard but quick enough to quite literally pat her on her cheek. She didn't try to hit me again until I was like 18 and 250 lbs of solid muscle.

"Hello all, 
 First off if you are reading this and you currently have your RDD in Multichain, stop right now and get them the hell out of there, don't make the mistake I made. I bought 2.6 Million RDD though the second 1/2 of the IPO and 2.4 Million more for a nice 4.5 Million total. As some of you may know the OSX file for Mac is currently not working and there is no alternatives. This subsequently left me with no other options other than to use Multichain to store my RDD. So I opened and account and started depositing, and today out of the blue I decided to check on my wallet, just cause you know RDD is awesome. I currently cannot access my account, I have entered the correct information along with my 2FA code and get nothing but a ""Login Failed!"". I sent Multichain an email but of course there is no response. 
 It in the end was my fault, I saw a thread warning me about it but of course my 17 year old head told me ""Oh it wont happen to you"". I was stupid, never should have used an online wallet and I will never again. Lesson learned, time to move on. 
 Anyone know if its possible for me to contact the developers and have them change the deposit address so I can salvage what is left? If so can anyone help me find an alternative way to store my RDD?

"A little background on me... I'm 29/M/5'11"", currently 256 pounds.  I started out at 317 pounds last September, and through diet alone brought myself down to 270 pounds in April.  I added exercise once I felt my body wouldn't injure itself moving the body weight around.  For the past two months I have been regularly seeing a personal trainer.  Currently, my doctor's readouts are telling me I have about 50 pounds of body fat on me still, so it's going to be a while before I'm at a healthy weight, but I'm progressing.  I still don't know what that all means, my end goal is to be under 200 pounds. 
 Now, on to my problem.  My absolute favorite thing in the world is to hike to the top of large hills / mountains, and to jog around home.  However, I haven't noticed any stamina increase when it comes to hiking trails with any kind of elevation gain, and my average time per mile jogging hasn't moved in weeks, despite weight loss and muscle gain.  I was just in Boulder, CO and did several hikes.  I did a 1300ft gain (Mt. Sanitas), and a 2200ft gain (Chautauqua ==> Green Mountain), and I was just as out of breath as I was back when I weighed my most. 
 So, my question is... what kind of exercises can I do to bring up my stamina?  I can currently run about an 11:30-12:00 mile sustained for multiple miles, or a 9:00 mile all out...   Nothing stops me short of being out of breath or exhaustion... I've managed to get past cramping after a couple of months running.  I'd like to get my distance running under 10:00.

"Now todays fuck up isn't as bad as the usual TIFU's, but it was embarrassing all the same. 
 I (M/mid 20's) work in one of the main clothing stores in the UK, but a rather small branch in a small, old fashioned town. By old fashioned I mean, the people have never left this place, for generations. Anything new, different or even mildly out of the ordinary is instantly frowned upon. 
 My day begins, it's quiet, very quiet and I'm on the menswear department by myself. I know that womenswear has just had a delivery of clothes, so I go grab a few boxes to help them out. 
 Once the paperwork has been checked over, you open the boxes, all the items of clothing are individually packaged in sealed plastic bags. You strip the bag off of the clothes, then you put a security tag on them, hang them up, then they're ready to go. 
 Now sometimes when processing the deliveries, they can kinda smell a bit weird. A chemical smell almost. From the new clothes or the plastic they're wrapped in I guess. But whilst I was sorting through this one, I could smell something different, like petrol or gas. So I grabbed the next one out of the box and gave it a sniff. My sense of smell isn't the best, so I went in for another one. But instead of a sniffing sound, I heard a loud gasp. 
 I looked up and there was a woman (mid 50's) and her son (17 maybe) staring at me. Her mouth wide open, but her eyes scowling. He just smirked. 
 There I was, standing with a pair of panties in my hand, held to my face, apparently not getting enough of them. They kept staring as I fumbled to try and pretend that I was reading a label or some shit, I don't know, I panicked! Nothing was said. They turned and left. 
 I just stood there, head in my hands, praying I wasn't standing where the security camera could have seen the whole thing.

"I am a 24 year old college graduate. I graduated with my bachelors in the standard four years. I have my degree in teaching (grades 6-12) but the subject I want to teach is very competitive so, for now, I am subbing. I make $100 a day. It's not a lot, but it's a decent amount considering I live at home. 
 I have a friend that I went to high school with, we are very close. She's been trying to get her degree at a community college since we graduated SEVEN years ago. I think she has finally dropped out... Who knows. 
 Anyway, she works at an after care center at a school. She always brags that she is payed ""salary"" but considering she works three hours a day, I'm not sure how high that salary is.  She recently got a second job as a hostess at a restaurant. Honestly, I have no idea how much she makes because 1) I don't care and 2... 
 THAT IS FREAKING RUDE! I was always raised to believe that it is incredibly crass and rude to ask a person what they make. I have some friends that are very successful in their careers, I have others that are not... Yet I do not know what any of them make and I would never ask. 
 The other day, I wound up subbing at the school she works her after care at. It was the end of the day, and she dropped in to see me. We were talking and she FLAT OUT asks me how much I make subbing... I was stunned. Looking back, I wish I had made a joke and blown it off... But I didnt. I told her. $105 a day. It's not a pay I'm embarrassed by, but not one I'm proud of either. 
 That was that. I really didn't think much of it. That is, until the next week. Me and like eight of my friends went out to dinner for her birthday. We were talking about entrees and I made a comment about wanting something, but that I wasn't going to get it because it was expensive. She looks at me and goes ""why? You make 100 dollars a day right?"" In front of everyone. 
 I was shocked. I really wish, again, I had said something. But again, in the moment, I laughed it off and made a joke like ""yeah, I have so much money I don't even know what to do with it all"" 
 One, I'm not sure if she makes more or less, so I don't knoww how to take her comment. It's possible she was saying it like that's a lot (it's not, but maybe for her it is?) or if she was being sarcastic and rude and taking a dig at what I make. In any event, I think it was so rude for her to announce that in front of all of our friends, as if asking in the first place wasn't bad enough. My freaking boyfriend doesn't even know what I make!! 
 I should add, my friend can be very immature and kind of clueless of social etiquette. She's not a good judge of character and I think social faux pas like that go right over her head. I don't think she was trying to be catty, I think she's really clueless...

"The details: We dated for 4 years starting at 16 years old.  We had a great relationship but I joined the Army at 18 years old and shipped overseas and never came back so I broke up with her after what would be 4 years together.

I'm happily married and have no interest in playing that game. 
 I have been trying to find her on facebook for a few years but with no luck.  It looked like she and her friends had my profile 'blocked' meaning I couldn't 'search' for her/them.  This is one of those little red flag moments, maybe I should stay away, but of course I decided to make a fake profile with fake pictures and whole back story of once sitting next to her in class in high school and then moving away when my fake parents divorced. Did I mention I found her profile with the new fake profile?  So I was blocked.  Surprisingly she bought it and friended me and has been openly hitting on fake me.  We've talked about school, life, work, music, and have hit it off really well.

"I recently came out in February to my (at the time) fiance. We agreed we had been staying together for our nearly 2 year old daughter and to break it off. We are still very good friends and see each other often (and when I say see...I mean see, I get asked if we hook up all the time.) 
 I've been told by multiple guys that they respect me and appreciate me for having a daughter and breaking stereotypes and helping promote equel rights. But am I really? I feel like there are plenty of bi / gay guys with children out there, perhaps they don't flaunt it? Though I'm sure a lot of them are still closeted, or stay together for the kids, hiding who they really are and hurting everyone involved (I know my emotional state towards the end of my relationship probably didn't benefit anyone.) 
 That being said, lots of guys will run away when they find out I have a child. I realize having a 2 year old at 24 is what some may call baggage (I call her Juliet and the best daughter anyone could ask for / my favorite comedia.) I guess it would be weird if someone found out I had a daughter and was extremely interested, but then on the other hand I find it weird that guys run away as if they are to be her step dad right away, haha. 
 I have gotten to the point where, unless I'm really comfortable with the guy / girl, I don't reveal right away that I have  a daughter. I'd prefer to do that shortly after the first date, if things go well. I mean, my daughter is an important part of my life and I love her and anyone who wants to be with me will eventually have to be in contact with her, but on the other hand, i see her like 5-10ish days a month.

"Years ago, I met this girl. At the time I was thirteen and she was twelve. Her family was visiting other family in California, and my mother worked for the family living in California by cleaning their house every other day. So I saw her constantly over the summer they were visiting. She hated my guts at first and didn't really want much to do with me. Her mindset at the time was that since I was the son of the cleaning lady working for her family I was below her. I thought she was incredibly pretty. I tried talking to her on numerous occasions, but she would usually ignore me or just flat out tell me to go away. One day, she had started playing her PS2 she had brought along with her, playing a game she had had trouble beating. I had already beaten the game and knew what to do. I laughed at her for not being able to beat the extra boss. She told me to try it and I did, winning. She screamed in joy and gave me a hug. She felt really cold. But I like it. She said I was amazing. Every day after that we talked whenever I came with my mother to help clean. We bonded so much in those last few weeks of summer. Then it was time for her to go. It wasn't too bad of a good bye. One final hug and exchange of IM names. Then bye. 
 Once school started, I always rushed home after school and other appointments I had to take care of to talk to her on IM. We would chat four hours a day at least. Doing homework at the same time, not responding and just enjoying the fact that someone was on the other end for you. She got a cell phone and so did I. We always texted after that. We also always called. Talking on the phone late into the night until one of us, usually her, fell asleep. 
 Her family in California moved away. There was no reason for her to ever go back there. We couldn't see each other anymore. By this time, it has been two years since we first met. That summer was filled with us scheming and trying to think of ways to see each other. Mostly just having joking fun, but actually wanting to see each other. Another year passed. Another year without each other. We had actually had several almost successful attempts to see each other. They all failed. We'd always feel depressed at the fact that we couldn't see each other for every brief chance we had. By this time, we said we loved each other. Very much. 
 I had been going through quite a bit. My mother had just had my little brother. He was born with several physical defects and went through numerous surgeries. There were many times where the doctors said he may not make it. I was very scared for my little brother and we went through a year of worrying and fear. He almost died. It's a bit difficult to see a small baby hooked up and tangled in so many wires, IVs, tubs going into his stomach, and stitches. I was scared. I tried to stay strong for her, and she thought I was doing fine and handling everything well on my own. But I wasn't. I needed someone to tell me he'd be fine and that I didn't have to worry. She wasn't there to do that for me. 
 During this time, though, I met someone else. She was a really odd girl, but at first she noticed how out of sorts I was and tried to comfort me without knowing the actual story. She hugged me and said it'd be alright. She was cold. I remembered her. It felt like it was her. I closed my eyes and pretended it was her. 
 I went out with this girl for the next few months. She found out and she told me how horrible of a friend I was for lying to her about my feelings. Not that I ""Cheated"" on her, because I lied to her. It went back and forth for a while with a few messages online. She said she was incredibly hurt and that this would ruin our friendship now. I didn't even think there was much of it left after what I'd done. Eventually we stopped. I broke up with the other one and heavily regret ever going out with her in the first place and wish I could have her again. I still miss her after so many years. I want to go see her. But I'm just scared. I've always been too scared when it came to her. I miss her, each and every day. I've kept old letters from her, drawings I made for her, and most of all I have  a shoe lace from way back when that matched a pair that she had.

"Yeah, it's formatted weird. Pretty much stream of consciousness, still kinda in the shock of things.- 
 So a few hours ago I found out me and my SO are expecting. Most likely a month or so along. Though scared shitless of the fiscal responsibility to come, I'm excited at the idea and always thought being a father would be a downright blast. I'm 25 and she is 23, been together for five years and have went the entire time without so much as a scare. 
 However, we're both unemployed and have been this way for several months now, though actively seeking, not to mention I've got about 30k owed in a failed tech school venture. (Long story.) I was hoping to find a job at least before fall and maybe save enough for certification or two in netsec/networking or take a few classes in programming, or even take helicopter flight lessons as it's a career I'd rather have than sitting indoors all day staring at a screen, no to mention the demand around Houston is pretty high and will be that way for the length of my career. 
 But now every shred of theoretical income I'll be getting will go to my SO and our child and I fear I'll be stuck to a dead end job, a situation my father found himself in when I came along and to this day, he's still trapped in. I want to be there for my child, not slaving away 14 hours a day just to barely make ends meet. We both came from poor families.

 Adoption will NOT be considered. Granted I know what it's like to grow up in dog-shit poverty, I'm sure as hell glad my parents didn't put me up for adoption. We talked about an abortion, but it's only if the health of the child or mother is in danger. 
 And tech school didn't work out because I was dumb and young, and that two as five years ago in another state even. Going back to finish wouldn't be an option, as from what I understand the requirements for an Aviation Maintenance certification have changed since I've been out.

 Furthermore, only her mom knows thus far. To be honest, we're rather concerned with her health. Luckily she has health insurance to hopefully tomorrow we'll be able to get her to a doctor for a check up. It's after this the entire family will be told.

"I actually had something like this happen when I was younger. For some reason 7 year old me decided it would be a good idea to help cute 8 year old neighbor girl carry a cinder block from the back yard to the front yard. About halfway there she DROPS HER END and the corner of the cinder block lands on the big toe of my sandaled right food. I scream, drawing the attention of one of her older siblings and some other neighbor kid. They proceed to watch as I manage to hop home on one foot, screaming, nearly blinded by tears, with blood dripping from my big toe. My mom bandages it up and the next day we get it x-rayed, nothing was broken. 
 A day or so later I thought it was healing alright, then we went to change the bandage. Along with the bandage comes my ENTIRE TOENAIL. Needless to say I was a bit freaked out. We called the doctor, apparently that sort of thing is fairly normal and it ended up growing back. I wanted to save it but my mom wouldn't let me.

"I'm on mobile, so forgive any formatting what-have-you's. 
 My boyfriend(31) and myself (26) have a generally fantastic relationship, with the only real imbalance being in signs of affection and our libidos. I've approached him a couple of times to talk about me needing to feel sexually wanted a little more, and if the lack of frequent sex was due to any lack of physical attraction or sexual chemistry or whatever the cause may be. Response was ""no, I guess I just don't need sex all the time"" 
 I've just been out of town for 2.5 weeks for work, and got back a few days ago. We had sex the day I came back involving some oral for him but none for me (though I asked and he's generally pretty enthusiastic about giving) and a session that seemed slightly lackluster. A couple of nights later, he spent the night and we had a nice dinner, watched some movies, and headed to bed. No sex. He's leaving town for maybe four or five days for his work, and I run pretty frisky, so I was hoping to stock pile a few goes in the old bank. 
 When he crawled into bed I tried to initiate, with no response, and I finally just said ""no sex tonight?"" To which he agreed, saying he was tired. 
 Normally this wouldn't concern me so much, but I've always been high libido in most of my relationships, and the men have not had such trouble matching me. I would prefer once a day plus maybe a middle of the night or a morning thrown in sporadically, and if I haven't seen you in a while? I want to feel like you just can't wait to tear my clothes off. I'm also pretty kinky and love to be tied up tied down blindfolded gagged spanked and teased, but we haven't even reached the point of a measly pair of handcuffs. (Though I've expressed my kinks before and asked if he had any at all that he would like to explore) 
 The real problem is that I am generally in need of more verbal assurances of affection, as opposed to acts or whatever. So when I was out of town,  the lack of communication made me feel even less wanted, even more clingy, etc.  I'm not comfortable with being this clingy girlfriend, who I've never been before. How to stop this spiral of feeling the need for affection and assertion and a good'n'honest couple of fuckfests?

"I'm 18M and I just came back from my first year of college. My girlfriend is 19F and will be coming home in a few weeks. We've been dating for not quite 2 years now and we're very serious and committed to each other. 
 My problem is with my parents, both 45, who at first glance are pretty normal. In fact, most people would say that they are extremely normal. But to me, there's something about them that makes me nervous. Not just a little nervous, but mortally afraid of something I don't even understand. I don't always feel this way about them, but I feel it especially when I need to ask them for something or when they tell me to do something. 
 Now mind you, I had a fairly normal childhood. They were strict and protective but not abusive. I was a shy kid and didn't have many friends, but they tended to support my efforts to hang out with the ones that I did have. In short, they did nothing exceptionally horrible to me, and gave me no reason to be afraid the way that I am now. 
 The thing is, they still give me no reason to be afraid. When I actually work up the nerve to ask them for permission to skip dinner to go on a date, they agree without protest. When I ask for anything, so long as it's not a big deal or I have a plan that makes sense, they are willing to comply. So why am I still afraid? Is there something wrong with me? 
 My girlfriend has, for our whole relationship, has had to deal with the fallout from my problem. On a regular basis I can't work up the nerve to tell them that I'm leaving for the evening, and end up canceling our date. The first time that she said something about it, however, was a much bigger deal. My parents had planned a week-long family vacation at the end of last June. That happens to be the same week as our anniversary, and to top it all off, she had to go under for surgery on another day of the same week. I was downright  terrified  of asking them if I could stay at home, but eventually I did it. I overcame my fear and begged them to let me stay- and they wouldn't hear of it. My girlfriend resented me for a while for it, but what was I supposed to do? 
 Later that summer, after I had gained her trust back, she began telling me that she ""didn't like the way that they treated me"" and that I should ""stand up for myself more."" I agreed, but I was still afraid, even more so than before. I continued to let the fear control me, canceling dates and taking a job they had lined up for me over one that would have given me more time with my GF. She continued to bring up the idea that they were controlling me, but we were still relatively happy and things were going just fine. 
 Once we moved out for college, things got better at first. Though we weren't at school together, I visited on the weekends and we got a decent amount of time together. We fought very little and our relationship was at its strongest. Then, at the end of the fall semester, we hit another speed bump. It's a familiar story: my family was going on vacation, she was going home, and we wanted to be together. This time, I worked up the courage to buy myself a plane ticket home before they left and tell them that I'd be leaving halfway through the trip, once we had Christmas together. They were perfectly fine with that, and things seemed okay. Unbeknownst to me, my GF was not too happy with the situation, and once I got home the talks about ""standing up for myself"" resurfaced. 
 This winter and spring, our relationship has been an emotional roller coaster. We haven't been together as much, due to her athletic schedule, which has caused a lot of undue stress on us. Also, my parents have planned an even bigger family trip for this summer,  in the same exact week as last year.  The only way I could possibly avoid going is if I have a job that requires me to be here- something I don't have- and even if I did, I'd be terrified to ask them for permission to stay. She has been particularly adamant about wanting me home for our anniversary, to the verge of tears, but has said that she'll deal with it if she has to. 
 Now that I'm home for the summer, my parents have given me a few chores to do around the house until I find a summer job. My GF, upon finding out that I'm obeying them instead of resisting and focusing on myself only, has  flipped the fuck out  and is threatening to leave me if I don't change immediately. What's more is that once I finally opened up to her about my irrational fear, she demanded that I find and see a therapist  on a weekend  to work it out or she will be gone. 
 I guess my question is: What do I do? How do I fix my problem in short order and fix my mess of a relationship? On the other hand, is it even worth fixing?",My parents are somewhat strict but I am mortally afraid of disobeying them for no apparent reason. My GF has dealt with the consquences of this for two years now and will likely leave if I don't turn it around. What the hell do I do?,18,M,relationships
"This year I had been doing well, starting with the new year I followed through with the workout resolution. With that and a couple of other changes I had been pulling myself out of my depression, but recently I have been slipping. My mother had been doing some spring cleaning and come across a series of folders that contained the official paperwork from her children's schooling. While my siblings folders were fairly thin and only contained report cards and a the few disciplinary write ups, mine was several inches thick. I had been a problem child for a long time and when I was 14 I think I got in the most trouble of my school years. It was shortly after the Columbine shooting and I made some bad jokes that got me expelled. Part of my expulsion included a psych eval, which I found in the folder that my mother had given me. This 15 page document didn't shine a light on my past, it highlighted it with a spotlight. Reading the most complex evaluation of my young mind had left me shaken. Ever since I read it I have wanted someone else to read it, I don't know what I expect them to say. So I scanned the report and redacted the information that could identify myself or the schools.

"20 M here, dating a 19 F for three years now. I first noticed signs of trouble when we would get into verbal arguments. At first she would just cry and try to see if I would forgive her. That or shift the subject to something else. If these tricks didn't work, it was like a switch just turned off in her head. She would go from being a girl that loved me and pleaded with me to being more understanding, to a girl who just didn't give a damn. All attraction or feelings she had for me minutes previously were gone. Nothing I could say would get through to her. She would calmly and calculatingly say the worst things imaginable to me. It's madness unlike anything I have ever seen. After being broken down by her, she would just give me space until I would eventually apologize. I am not saying I'm the strongest person here, but I invested a lot of time and money into a relationship with a person I care a lot about. So I went out of my way to try and fix things.

I told her I needed time to think about it. The waterworks stopped. Then I realized that she honestly did not feel guilty at all. Right then, she would have been able to cut me out of her life without a second glance. Is it possible for someone to fake emotion for the 3 years we were involved? Did she ever really love me?

"I'm currently in a long term relationship with my incredible boyfriend. For most of our relationship he was on the fence about children. About a year ago, he told me that he really does not want children. 
 As for me, I always thought I would have them when I was a bit older. Thinking things like ""I'll have when I'm 25... No wait... I want to work... Maybe 30? No... I want to travel... 40 still good?"" 
 So here's where I feel like a complete piece of shit.
My super awesome boyfriend and I are protected by birth control pills at the moment and when he first came to me about being child free, I was supportive but deep down I thought ""I'll just stop the pill when I want a baby. He'll learn to love it.""
But after working a few years for a fast food monster and another couple of years for a retail conglomerate,  as well as earning a post secondary education in a field that makes a ton of money  I will NEVER have children (this epiphany came to me about 4 months after my bf made the child free declaration).The thought of betraying his trust like that makes me sick. 
 But I still feel like a piece of worthless shit for even having such an entitled frame of mind at the time after everything he's done for me. I hate kids so much to the point where I'm getting an IUD put in with hopes of tying my tubes at some point (once I get some questions answered). 
 With that being said, should I tell him how I thought? Or should I keep it to myself? I don't like keeping things from him.

"So my boyfriend (M18) and I (F18) have been dating for almost a year now. He has always had a lot of friends who are girls and sometimes that makes me extremely uncomfortable. It doesn't help that he's had a crush on a few of them before he met me. I also don't know most of them well at all. 
 When he talks to them, he'll often say something like, ""hey beautiful"" and always gives them long hugs. On nights that he's not with me, he'll be on facebook talking to them for hours. Or a girl will post something on his Facebook page that will get me upset.

I watch him lay down on the couch and open the jar of peanut butter. Enter Clifford, his dog. The dog takes a seat at his side, near his waste, staring intently at him. My friend then takes his hand and scoops out some peanut butter and begins to spread it all over his now erect penis. He turns his body so that his legs are hanging off of the couch and his cock and balls are hanging in the air covered in peanut butter. He gets the dogs attention, positions him in front and the dog starts going to town licking the peanut butter from his dick. I slowly duck and crawl off the porch so he doesn't see me.

"I'm trying to think how to write it to make it as concise as possible, it was a clusterfuck. This is going to be long to fully detail this dude's wtfery. I mean, typical bad boyfriend behaviour but imo a lot of shady shit, too. 
 So I was 17ish, playing Everquest back when it was ""cool"" and met him in EQ of all things. While not a dating site it was still online and an even worse thing to do than using a dating site imo. But anyway, EQ moved to IMs moved to webcams moved to phone calls, over the course of a week or something stupid, and it was omglove and he lived only 4 hrs from me, and he was only a few months older than me. Naive teenage mind thought this was all find and dandy and amazing. 
 A month after knowing this douchenozzle he hops on a Greyhound bus and comes to visit (he didn't have a driver's license, and did not know how to drive). My parents are skeptical of this ordeal but were trying very hard to be cool, something I can look back on and thank them for since it allowed me to learn from my mistakes. So we're omginlove and on that FIRST motherfucking visit the dude proposes to me. But you see I was IN LOVE and this was THE BEST THING so I said yes. Parents are instantly a lot less cool with the situation but say nothing. 
 So this whole thing started the summer before my senior year of high school, and ended just after I graduated. In this time, he'd come visit once a month via bus or we'd (Mom and I) go visit him. My parents became more and more distrustful of this scumdog and I thought they were just being dicks, so I became pretty angry with them. Mom only drove me to meet him because she is a badass and knew I'd steal her car to go alone if she didn't, and she didn't want me alone with this guy. I feel pretty bad about that bit. It was on one of the trips to see him probably in December or January that he poisoned her. 
 He was pretty hateful of them by now, too, because they knew he was crap and hated him and he didn't want all this to fall down around him and cause me to leave. The three of us (Mom, me, him) all ate the same food for dinner that night. The only thing my mom had that no one else had was a cup of coffee that he prepared out of sight in the kitchen, and I guess my mom didn't think he'd stoop this low so she didn't watch him make it. He never admitted to what he put into the coffee but whatever it was made my mom dreadfully sick. She was down and vomiting within an hour, and had horrific stomach cramps and diarrhea. She developed a fever. We slept very little that night and I had to drive her home early the next morning as she could barely walk. She refused to go to a hospital at any point and after several days she slowly got better. She told us she had food poisoning. We bought it. And after that she wouldn't let me go visit him anymore, and he was not allowed in our house overnight (he used to stay the night when he'd come). 
 One of his tall tales a month or two after that was that the reason he was so late getting home from his bus ride back was that the Greyhound flipped and he had to walk the rest of the way until his dad would pick him up. My mom's bullshit detectors went off, she called Greyhound and looked up news reports for the area and there were no accidents. Now she forbid him from being anywhere near me, but you ultimately can't stop a teenager from ""going out"" so I still did because my parents were CLEARLY WRONG and I was IN LOVE! 
 From day 1 until it was over the dude was rough and abusive, and did it cleverly without me noticing it until I came to my senses. Too rough during sex, bashing my head against the headboard (""oops!""); too rough during sparring (we both took martial arts) and nearly broke my leg twice; various bruises and cuts all over from ""accidents""; and once he nearly put my eye out by cleverly moving a part of my desk while I bent over to retrieve a fallen pencil, causing me to crack me face on the sharp corner. A half inch lower would have taken my eye. I have a massive scar in my brow and below from that (that shit bleeds like crazy, fucking eye injuries). 
 SO the final turning point that made me wake up was after high school graduation. He came to graduation, much to everyone's dismay. My whole family was about to kill this dude. I said ""fuck you"" to them all and ran off with him for most of the evening, and he left the next day. He called a week later in tears, saying ""it wasn't my fault"" and ""I didn't mean to"" and I finally got out of him that he'd slept with his father's girlfriend. Let me clarify that the dude was 18, the girlfriend was 23ish, and the dad was in his 40s, in case anyone wonders. 
 So he's just slept with the girlfriend, and he says it was an accident. He just woke up and she was on top and he couldn't get away so he just finished. This finally set off my bullshit detectors, which apparently didn't function very well. I told him that was stupid and that we were over. He proceeded to harass me for the next year, himself and via my friends that he still had on his side. He also continued to fuck the dad's girlfriend when his dad wasn't home (according to the grapevine). 
 He eventually disappeared and no one knows where he is. Good riddance. My mom told me later that she'd been poisoned, that she could tell something was off with the coffee but she was afraid to say anything because the dude was a timebomb and didn't want me to be injured if she caused a scene. I just wonder why my parents never called the cops or anything on this guy. I guess the evidence wasn't obvious enough to point to him, or something. I dunno. That was ten years ago so def nothing worth worrying over now.","Exfiance poisons my mom, nearly puts my eye out, and then fucks his dad's girlfriend",17,F,AskReddit
"My wife and I marred when we were 19, shortly before our 20th birthdays (they're close together). One of her reservations prior to our getting married was that she wanted more sexual experiences, we were actually both virgins until we met. However, at the time I had more conservative views and was against it, she acquiesced, we got married. 
 Ever since she's periodically brought up that she would like to be in an open marriage. For a long time I was against it, but the last few years the idea hasn't really bothered me that much. Now my main issue is that, she being female, is going to have a really easy time finding sex outside of our marriage. I, however, have no romantic experience with other women, am generally taciturn, and not particularly attractive. To put it mildly, my chances are slim. 
 We've been married 8 years and are still delaying having children for another year or two. If this is going to happen while we're still relatively young and unencumbered  then the window is getting pretty short. I don't want to feel like I'm restraining her from something she wants, but at the same time I also don't want to end up jealous/depressed because my wife is seeing someone on the side and I'm not.","My wife wants an open relationship, I'm not sure if I do because I'm dubious about my chances of getting of laid.",27,M,relationships
"I've been with my girlfriend for almost two years now. We met in college and we are now long distance since I have transferred schools about six months into our relationship. When we first started dating she told me she was a virgin and wanted to wait till marriage, which I saw as a huge problem. I still took the chance though because she's absolutely incredible, and I'm happy I did. After about three months she told me she was ready to have sex and it just added one more great thing to our relationship. Up until now I couldn't have been any happier. 
 We've been long distance for over a year now and things have still been great. We both live in California, so I fly up a ton to see her. I see her about once or twice a month during the school year and we spend weeks at a time together during summer and winter break. When we do see each other, we tend to spend a good amount of time having sex, eating and watching Netflix. So it's a big part of our relationship, it's not the biggest by any means, nor the most important, but it's still huge! 
 About two months ago she sprung this idea on me that she wanted to wait till marriage to have sex again. She said that she feels guilty after we've done it and she believes it's something married people do. I know part of this is due to her upbringing (her family is very spiritual and her mom made it a point to teach the children the importance of sex early on in their lives) although I don't understand the idea completely, I get where it comes from and the importance of it to her. At first I told her it would cause a lot of stress and would probably cause a lot of problems (and it has), but reluctantly I said I'd try my best and I have. The thing is when we see each other there are ""slip-ups"" and we end up having sex only so we can be upset and talk about the whole situation again. Every time we talk about the subject, she always says it's just a couple years (we've talked about possibly getting engaged after college), but now I'm thinking marriage could be a ways off, since I would like to pursue my PhD so I can become a professor. I don't have a problem getting engaged after college, but I don't want to get married until I can support myself and her, plus having a relationship in grad school is hard enough from what I've heard. So marriage could be about six years down the road. I can't wait six years to have sex with my girlfriend who I've already had sex with. 
 Am I being selfish in this situation? I want to support my girlfriend, but I want to have sex. I don't want to break up with her. I would like a solution to all of this, but I'm having a hard time finding one. I love her dearly and she has helped me grow as a person in ways I couldn't imagine. She has always been supportive, and I've always tried to support her, but I can't get behind this decision. I'm confused, stressed, flustered and to be honest I'm afraid. Please provide me with some perspective or some advice or a hug is cool too because I'm losing my mind.","My girlfriend wants to wait till marriage to have sex, even though we've already had sex with each other.

About 3 days ago her and her boyfriend broke up and we've started talking a tiny bit and I think i would like to give me and her another go now that there is no one to get in the way. I want to know what the best way of going about it would be? considering our history and the original nature of our relationship. Any advice would be greatly appreciated as I feel something exceptional for this girl (Typical teen cliche I know) thanks in advance. Time is a bit of an issue as im from a small town and good looking girls like her don't stay single for long.","Met a girl had different kind of friendship wanted more grew apart, shes newly single I want to try again",18,M,relationships
"I'm about to start my second Masters in Public Health (MPH ). My first Masters was in basic science and I was able to get my tuition and stipend covered by my mentor.

"This is my first time posting here! Hello! 
Kinda a long story..... 
 It was my 21st birthday, beginning of my senior year of college. I was incredibly sick, my roommate had to feed me in bed for the past week. Well, I woke up that morning, still single, on my birthday, and said to my girlfriends, ""I am going to be single for this year!"" (you know,  girl power  and all). So we decided to just go out to dinner just us four girls, and then hang out at my friend's apartment for the night, because I really didn't have the strength to walk, let alone go out and party.
Well, it turns out that my friend has been talking to the boys across the hall in the complex for a few weeks, and they were throwing a party for a roommate whose birthday is the day before mine. Being without any plans, we just drank some wine, and went over there and kinda turned his bday party into my bday party once it hit midnight. 
Well, about 10 of us were sitting around in the living room, introducing ourselves, eating cake. A couple of the roommates were pretty drunk, and sat down on the couch across the room from me. So I go first, and I'm like, ""Hey, my name is Jacki."" and this boy looks at me from across the room, eyes glazed over, and says really loud, ""THATS MY EXGIRLFRIENDS NAME"". I notice he is cute, but I didn't think anything of it, because WHO SAYS THAT?
well, we all keep talking, and me and drunk boy find out that we are in the same 700 person psych class for freshman that neither one of us took yet, so (being a confident bday girl), I look across the room at him, throw my phone at him and say ""put your number in my phone."" 
I texted him about a study guide the next class, and after a few classes of texting back and forth and using going over to our friends apartments as an excuse to see each other, we fell in love and have been together for the past 10 months, LD since June. I have never been so incredibly happy. We are great together.","we met at a party, his first words to me were ""that's my exgirlfriends name"".",21,F,LongDistance
"One of my favorite stories to tell: 
 For my 21st Birthday, I was working in Toronto for a few months to open a new facility. Even though I could drink just by crossing the border into Canada, my friends wanted to do something for my birthday. 
 My company was pretty cool at the time before the economy hit the shitter and they had to tighten things up more. So, my company flew my coworkers who were also my friends to Toronto for the week. They helped me do opening training work during the day, and we would party every night the whole week. 
 When it came to my birthday, I told them I wanted to go to as many gay bars in one night as possible. So we headed to Church Street and proceeded to get smashed. I don't remember all the bars, but we were doing all sorts of shots bought by awesome Canadians because they're the nicest people ever. 
 The last bar we went to was a little bit further out than the other bars. There was a sign on the door essentially saying that you agreed to be videotaped by entering the premises. I thought it was just a security/surveilance camera kind of notice. There was a drag queen doing a standup routine with about 6 guys standing in their underwear behind her. 
 So there I am, completely hammered with my coworkers, one of whom was my HR manager. Apparently, I was being too loud while the drag queen was doing her standup routine and called me up out of the audience on stage to tell me I was being too loud. I explained that I was celebrating my 21st and visiting from the States. She said she had a present for me, and to close my eyes and lift up my arms. I complied, and within 5 seconds, the 6 guys standing behind her had stripped me bare ass naked on stage in front of a huge bar full of people... including my coworkers and HR manager. 
 She said she would give me free drinks if I participated in naked wrestling with the 6 other guys, who were pretty hot, so I agreed. So I naked wrestled in front of a crowd for about 30 minutes with a huge hardon, before they dismissed me back to the audience and the ""professionals"" proceeded to fuck eachother on stage. 
 I put my clothes back on, my friends/coworkers dragged me out to the car. Some thought it was hilarious, others were clearly mortified, but no one really said anything on the way back. I passed out on the ride back to our hotel. The next morning, I was afraid I was going to get fired. No one ever said a word about that night, except my best friend who came out to me as bi. 
 Turns out this ""bar"" had a website and sold videos of such events online. So, for a couple years, I was afraid of other people finding out about it. Luckily, it seems the site doesn't exist anymore, so I'm more open about telling the story. So there's video of it out there somewhere, just don't ask me to help you find it. 
 I should note the I later found 2 of the guys that I wrestled with online and hooked up with them about a month afterwards. It wasn't mindblowing sex or anything, but it was still pretty hot. 
 I had a lot of crazy times in Toronto, including the one time I passed out on the street during Pride dressed in rainbows and white hot pants. I didn't wake up until the next morning at about 10:00AM splayed across the steps of a bank as customers and employees were walking around me and my stuff that was strewn about me. 
 When I lived there, I would frequently go downtown during the weekend, get smashed, and stay at the bathhouse at night because I was too drunk to drive home and it was a pretty cheap way to crash and sober up. Those nights ended up in some weird orgies.","Celebrated my 21st birthday in Toronto, wrestled naked on stage in front of my coworkers.",21,M,gaybros

"Hey guys I know that in all likeliness no one will see this, but it's worth a shot I guess. The past year has been really rough for me, culminating in some of the worst months I've ever experienced in my life. 
 Back last year around this time I was training for football double sessions as usual. Despite busting my ass, and giving a good consistent effort, I ended up getting mixed messages from my coaches, specifically my lineman coach, and didn't end up starting varsity. After a couple of games into the season with the addition of injuries, I got some playing time, blocking better than the normal starters. However, this was short lived, and I ended up getting only a quarter or so of playing time for the rest of the season, playing sparsely on Senior Night and Thanksgiving. Failing at playing one of the things I've loved my whole life hurt a lot, but I was so busy with applying to schools that I didn't have much time to think about it. 
 Football season ends and a couple days later I attend my first party, never having drank before. The party was at this popular girl's house for her 18th birthday, and was pretty fun since I never drank before. 
 Anyways me and this girl begin getting to know each other better over the coming months, hanging out, seeing each other at parties, etc. After a while we see each other a bit less with winter sports going on, but we still talk a lot during class. 
                                    ...
 
 At the beginning of spring, was when everything really went to shit. Despite working out all winter and practicing my stick skills for lacrosse with my buddy, I get stuck on the bench behind the athletic director's unathletic son. After being constantly shit on by my coach for doing things CORRECT, I had to draw the line and quit. I liked lax, I still do, but I didn't want to be miserable for the rest of my last year of high school. 
 The Friday after I quit lacrosse my buddy had a big party, a great opportunity for me to ask someone to the prom. The house was packed with kids, and I had trouble finding the girl I liked, let alone talk to her. After a fun night of winning 5 straight in pong with my buddy, the party comes to a close because the dad of my friend who's hosting the party was coming back home earlier than expected. He's cleaning up with a few other people, including the girl I liked. Seeing this as my opportunity, I tell my friend I'll help him clean up. Being the paranoid asshole he can be sometimes, he tells me to go home, he's got it taken care of. 
 Next morning a good majority of my college acceptance letters come in,  REJECTION   REJECTION   REJECTION   REJECTION . Already severely depressed/in shock, I find out later in the day that girl I liked was asked to prom by someone else. Crushed... 
 By the time they all came in, I got rejected by 8/9 schools, forcing me to go to my safety school. I was in a state of self-hate and frustration for the remainder of the school year. I wasn't going to go to prom, since everyone already had a date, and because I didn't want to take anyone else but her. 
 You would think this is where my misery ends but nope. I get a call one night from my mom, who happens to be a hair dresser, saying that one of her clients, this sophomore girl who goes to a private school wants me to take her to prom. I only knew the girl from helping her take a train a couple years back. I assumed that the girl, being super attractive, was only going with me out of pity or just to go to a prom. But without any other options, I agreed to take her. 
 Apparently the senior girls in my school didn't like her for whatever reason, as she told me she was even threatened not to show up to prom by one of them. The girl who I was originally going to ask to prom texted me trying to shit on my date, and I blew her off. 
 Fast forward to prom night, I'm with my date who is easily the hottest girl I've ever seen, let alone take anywhere as a date. Because the senior girls gave her so much shit I couldn't take before prom pictures with the majority of my grade, and had to sit at a prom table with all weirdos. Despite a somewhat shitty start, I was optimistic that the night would get a whole lot better, until I found out that my date  doesn't dance . Disappointed, I sit with her and one of her friends, this sophomore I played football with, for the majority of the night. Plans for an after party fell apart since prom was on a tuesday night, so me, my date and a couple friends go down the beach to drink. She doesn't say a word to me the rest of the night, and leaves with the kid who was sitting with us earlier, leaving me and my friends to drink the stupid fucking Mike's hard lemonade that she wanted. I smashed the last bottle I was so pissed.

"I live in Portugal. 
 My boyfriend is 18 years old he has this stupid idea in his head that he wants to tag, I've always been against it (I'm 22) and I've told him multiple times but he just stops in the middle of the street and tags while I keep walking and ignoring him. 
 He came to visit me in my town (45 min away from his) and was insisting on bringing his cans so in my rage I told him a private property (hotel that was not licensed) that he could go and explore or tag. 
We went there on his motorcycle and parked on the street, entered the property he tagged the place and we left.
Has he was starting his bike on a public street and I was walking a long the street a security guard approaches me and accuses me of having sprayed the place because the walls now are painted. 
 My boyfriend arrives with the bike the man explains again...I say I wanted to show the place to my boyfriend because from this place we can look over the entire town, he says I'm lying. 
 Another security guard arrives, neither of them showed Identification, at first I thought they were random people.
They again ask for Id, I say I don't know them from anywhere and won't show my Id because I don't know if they will steal it from me. The other guy keeps rambling about calling the police and not finding the number, and I tell him ''I thought this place was abandoned'' 
He answers that it's just looking for investors and that I'm admitting to graffiti to which I say no or don't answer, I don't remember.
To avoid him calling the police since he said I had cans in my bag and I actually had them and weren't even mine I gave him my ID and my bf too (they were in front of the bike and saying they could break it and hide it). 
They took our names and said they were going to press charges and we left.

"I'm a 25 year old woman in pretty good health. I smoke marijuana daily and drink alcohol almost every weekend. I definitely prefer to smoke over drinking. I don't usually get fall-down drunk except maybe once or twice a year. I am very aware of my limits and avoid drinking in excess. (But I do still like to have a good time ;) ) 
 This has happened on three occasions which I will detail in chronological order:
1st time, approximately 7 years ago. I was 18 years old. That evening I had maybe 1 or 2 Bud Lights and also a decent-sized Vicodin. (Side note: I no longer abuse prescription medications. I experimented a bit in high school and after graduation, but I haven't taken a medication not prescribed to me in over 5 years.) We were smoking a big fat joint and someone gave me a huge shot gun off of it. Almost immediately after exhaling, I started feeling light-headed and really hot, and started to sweat. I stood to excuse myself to have a quiet moment in the bathroom to calm down, but as I stood I blacked out and hit my head on an end table. I came to a few seconds later to my then-boyfriend and a couple of friends standing over me, frantic. I was face down when they ""woke me"" and couldn't remember anything after feeling hot. I was shaky when they stood me up and my ex insisted on going home. I rested up and then felt fine afterwards. I chalked this up to me fainting due to maybe not getting enough oxygen during the shot gun hit. 
 2nd instance was almost exactly 3 years ago. Once again, I was at a friends house having a few drinks and smoking socially like I always do. I was sitting on my friends front porch and we were having a good heart-to-heart about her mom who had cancer, when I started feeling light-headed and super hot again. I was trying really hard to focus on my friend talking because I cared very much about what she was saying, but I was losing my concentration. When I woke up my friends were standing around me calling my name and saying ""Are you okay?"" I had fallen out of my chair and was blacked out on the porch. In this instance, I also figured I had fainted because I hadn't been eating much recently. I had just gotten out of a long relationship and I was very depressed. I never felt hungry so I never ate. I assumed that I had fainted because of that, and made sure I started eating regularly again even if I didn't feel like it. 
 The most recent incident occurred last night. I started drinking around 9:30pm. I had three drinks over the course of 2-3 hrs. I stopped drinking around midnight when we left to another area of town. We stopped and I had half of a sub sandwich. Then we left to a nice scenic area to sit down and have a toke. We smoked a nice big bowl of some good weed that I had purchased as normal from my same dealer of about 2 or 3 years now. These are not seedy people. My dealer is a good friend of mine, I have also met the people he buys from and they are older hippies. I truly cannot believe that any one of them could have sold me something laced, it's just not that kind of scene. After we smoked the bowl, we decided we were all getting tired so we headed back home. I was in the back seat of the car. When we got in the car and started driving, I felt light-headed, hot, and sweaty again. I thought maybe I was going to be sick from drinking, even though I had definitely stayed well below my limits. I opened my car window to get some air, and rested my head. Black out. When I came to we were parked on the side of the road and my friends were standing with my car door open, same spiel ""Oh my God, are you okay?"" This time was  a BIT different though... While I was blacked out I was having visions. It was almost like a memory or a dream, not unpleasant. I remember seeing my son and my mom, and some friends. It was almost like I was living another moment though, or maybe it was just flashes of things. Recalling the ""dream"" is like recalling any other dream: the more I try to grasp onto the details, the further they slip away from me. When my friends brought me around after I blacked out, they said I was laughing and saying ""Guys, guys, guys."" The closest thing I can compare this to is an intense salvia trip. I have experimented with the 40x variety a few years ago and it was very much the same sensation - Loss of control of my body and seeing almost an alternate reality. 
 I was really shaken up when they brought me around and so were they. I kept apologizing for scaring them. They told me that when I was blacked out, my eyes rolled in the back of my head and I was twitching (not violent seizures just twitching). I was blacked out for about 60 seconds. After I came to they got me some water and we kept driving back. Eventually one of my friends got me home, I left my car elsewhere so I wouldn't have to drive. I was kind of nauseous and still feeling light-headed and very drained. But this is where I started connecting the dots because I recognized that really hot and light-headed feeling that is the onset of each incident. I didn't go to the ER because I know that the other times this has happened I was fine. 
 I saw my primary care doctor today who told me all my vitals looked fine and did a basic assessment of my nerves there in the office and said I reacted well. I had a CT scan which came back normal. My vitals are good. She took a blood panel to check my metabolic systems and also a urine screening to ensure I wasn't dosed with anything without my knowledge. I should have those results back tonight. I am going to see a neurologist sometime next week. 
 My doctor thinks that the common denominator here is mixing alcohol and marijuana. I see that all the signs would point to that considering it has never happened when I'm sober, but I'm still having a hard time wrapping my mind around that. I have combined the two for years and years in much more excessive amounts time and time again and not had any issues. Overall last night was more a of ""mild"" night out for me. Today I feel a little sleepy (I didn't get much since we got home a little later.) but okay in general. 
 I'm getting ready to take my dog out for a nice little park stroll and maybe read under a shady tree and just try to relax or take a nap. I took the rest of the day off work. For now I am going to avoid mixing the two drugs, and just stick with smoking pot. Like I said before, I definitely prefer marijuana. I would be truly heartbroken if this was the cause of my affliction. Marijuana to me is a miracle plant, and I truly believe in legalization and the plants' useful applications in all different industries. I know one other girl about my age who I've heard doesn't smoke weed or like being around it because it causes her seizures though. 
 Has anyone ever experienced anything like this, or heard about it? Any recommendations on how to move forward. What about dosing with psychedelics? I am also very much an advocate for their therapeutic uses. I have experimented with 2CI with no instance. I usually eat mushrooms every 3-4 months. I have also dabbled with LSD and had one really fun molly experience. That's about the limit of my recreational drug use.","Have had what I think are seizures on 3 separate occasions over the span of 7 years, while under the influence of marijuana and alcohol.

"As the title states, do you guys and girls find it strange or wrong if a person wishes to be foreveralone? I for one do in fact want to become just that. I want to experience how it is. Now, perhaps I should explain a bit of my reasoning behind this. As of right now, I'm not foreveralone in terms of ”friends”. Really, I consider them more as  acquaintances, or rather people I just conversate with. I don't tend to share my true feelings or thoughts with them at all in regards to serious matters about my life. I mostly just joke around and have a nice, friendly time with them. As for my lovelife, I am 100% foreveralone in that area. I have never had a girlfriend in the last 18 years that I've been on this earth. If anything, I can at least say that I have never been friendzoned. Never try, never fail, right? It's such a simple and true theory that I can always find comfort in. Now, I'm not going to pretend that thought of having a girlfriend hasn't crossed my mind more than a few times. But whenever that happens, I just remind myself of this theory and for a little bit, that thought is pushed to the back of mind. For those few minutes, I feel genuine happiness take over and I smile.

It's one of the only things I take comfort in, besides myself and the internet. I was taught that family would be the only ones there for you whenever you need them. This has held up true for me to this very day. I can always take comfort in them, but even they don't know of my true intentions or secrets. If worst comes to worst, I always have myself to rely on.

"After my divorce I was forced to move out and to live on rent for couple of months. I got a nice deal on a small cottage on the edge of the city. It was in bad condition but nothing I couldn't fix myself or with my friends. So I bought the home for 68k EUR, pretty much for the price of the property as the owner wanted to get rid of it. Compare that to the cheapest condo I could find, 80k EUR plus 30k EUR for pipe/plumbing job, totaling 110k EUR. 
 Couple of first months were horrible. ""Why I bought this shitty house? The roof is leaking, the bathroom walls are covered in mold, the kitchen is a god-awful mess, I can't get enough hot water for a proper shower, the yard looks like someone ran a junkyard here. Everyone thinks I'm nuts for moving into this place!"" During couple of months, I installed a new kitchen, painted the house, repaired the roof and chimney so I could use the fireplace on fall and winter. Slowly it started to look like a real home. It's a really quiet and peaceful, next to the nature and a park. 
 Anyway, to the point. After my summer leave I returned to work. I realized something had changed. On my drive to work, I couldn't stand listening to music or the news. The traffic was horrible. The office was loud, everyone so busy and in hurry. I turned on my workstation. 330 new e-mails. Even if I had liked my job before, the cost savings and layoffs made during the last two years (hey, let's fire the secretary and leave all the office work for engineers!) had turned this nice and cozy engineering job into a super stressful one. 
 Was this the thing I wanted to do for the next 50 years? Hell no. When I came home that day, I did some calculations. If I managed my finances properly and saved about 700 euros per month atop my mortgage payments, I would be debt free in September 2020 - just in time for my 35th birthday. 
 If I didn't need to pay mortgage (400 euros a month) or have to pay the upkeep of a car to get to work (600 euros a month), I could make do with about 200 euros in house expenses and 300 euros for food and ~500 euros for everything else. And now that my boyfriend moved in with me, we are able to split bills. I wouldn't be surprised if we managed to live with just shy of 1000 euros if needed. 
 But, where am I going to get that 1000 euros? From my hobby which is running a small web store as a side business. I know it sounds weird, but I really enjoy it. I can do it on my own pace, I love the products, have amazing customers and best of all, the work I need to do (maybe 2 hours a day tops) is fun!","Moved somewhere next to the nature, realized my job is not for me but I'm working here for couple of years so I've got my mortgage paid.",35,M,financialindependence
"22, male. 
 
 I have a Bachelor's in Mathematics and will begin law school next year. 
 
 Yes! 
 
 Introduce them to more abstract mathematical subjects rather than just the hard calculations and applications of mathematics. Many people don't realize the creativity involved in what is taught at higher level math courses in university and just assume math is all about difficult, brute force calculations. This is not true! If they taught something like graph theory in K-12 schools, I am sure you would have more kids interested in math. Learning about theoretical structures and about which shapes are possible and not possible to construct, and challenging students to come up with an example of such using their own creativity would have been something that I would love to have done in my school years! Instead it was all solving polynomials, doing applications and word problems, and just overall boring and soulless class material that would turn anyone off of the subject. 
 
 Very much so! Many people don't understand why I am a math major going to law school, but the logic in mathematics is extremely relevant to what is used in the practice of law. The outside of the box thinking that I had learned from so many years of creating theorems and proofs helped me perform well on the LSAT, and basically changed how I approach many problems day to day.

"I'll try to make this short, but it's probably going to end up a bit long anyhow.  Sorry in advance. 
 Background : I'm in my late 20s, she's in her mid-20s, we're both otherwise stable and well educated. We both have competetive/stressful careers that demand a lot from us. 
 We've been dating a bit over a year, and things were absolutely amazing for the first 3-4 months.  After that, she kind of had a breakdown where she was feeling incredible anxiety about us.  We took a few weeks off over the holidays, and talked after about what we both wanted, and decided to give things another try.  Things went really well for another 3-4 months, and then the anxiety came back.  Since then, the anxiety has been intermittent, punctated with some really awesome times.  When things are good, we have a ton of fun together, relate extremely well, and otherwise have a great relationship.  We communicate extremely well, and have very similar goals. 
 However, when things are bad, they really suck.  She'll break down out of nowhere and feel incredibly anxious about our relationship, to the point where she feels she needs to do anything she can to get away from that feeling.  She says very hurtful things ( e.g. , ""I don't know how I'm ever happy with you"" or ""I don't know if I'd be better off without you in my life""), which it turn make me hurt and insecure about our relationship and how she really feels about me.  After these, I'll feel a bit weird about things for a couple of days, which creates a pretty horrible feedback loop.  Generally, we'll make us, she'll tell me that she really does care about me and doesn't want to loose me, all that jazz, and that it's the anxiety that's the problem.  I'll question her on it sometimes, but generally I believe that she does want to be with me and that it really is a mental health issue.  Though she claims it's specifically about the relationship and committment, I've noticed that she's definitely at her worst when she's under additional pressure.  She's always been a worrier, but she's never had anxiety like this.  It's to the point where if anything is less than perfect ( e.g.,  one or both of us is really tired) she'll see that as cause to worry about how she feels, which will trigger her anxiety.  If there's nothing at present to worry about, she'll worry about how she might feel sometime in the future. 
 When she's calmed down and we talk about it, she'll feel bad about things, but she usually can't pinpoint anything in specific that set it off.  The best she's come up with is that she's afraid of me depending on her, which I find a bit odd since I'm generally a very independent person and feel I support her much more than she's ever supported me.  I hardly rely on her for any emotional support anymore because I'm not sure when she's going to spontaneously break down.  I avoid burdening her with any of my difficulties, but yet I am still her primary means of social support.  We saw a therapist together for a while about six months ago, and we had a few months with no anxiety where things were awesome, but I attribute that mostly to the fact that we both had relatively low-stress summers.  She started seeing a psychiatrist independently now, but after ~2 months things haven't really improved. 
 Does anybody out there have any experience with this?  This is a girl that I could see myself being with indefinitely  if  the anxiety were not such an issue.  Am I an idiot for continuing to try?  Any advice in general?  I'm kind of running out of ideas to try, and feel like I have to work soo hard to be the emotional support for both of us when I don't have anyone I can rely on myself.",Been dating a girl with relationship anxiety for about a year.

"I should probably start by saying that I might be considered ""damaged goods""-- I've never had a relationship longer than a few months in which I have not been cheated on. 
Highlights: the first time, my boyfriend cheated on me with another guy, which gave me some self-confidence issues. (The sexuality part shouldn't matter, I know, but it is still tough to deal with). The most recent example landed me with a guy who cheated with several women through the course of the 2 year relationship, culminating with my younger sister.
Basically, I have some trust issues, and have become fairly deeply afraid of ""letting people in;"" honestly, this is just as much to do with the betrayal of my sister, whom I was very close to all my life, just as much as my boyfriends. 
 But I met this wonderful guy online just over a year ago, about a year after the latest cheating incident. He knew about all of that from the beginning, and I explained that it may be hard for me to completely open up without enough time. He was still willing and really wanted to be with me, so I gave it a go. 
 This guy has become my best friend- our relationship is amazing, great sex life, and he has mentioned eventually wanting to move in together and get married etc. He was the first to ask me out, give me a kiss, a key to his place, and bring up the future together. He always goes way out of his way to do everything he can to make me happy, and I truly think I'm falling in love with him. 
 While this is scary for obvious reasons, as I believed myself in love with the last guy too, it is even scarier to tell him I am feeling this way. He has not said ""I love you"" yet, and neither have I, even after a year. He makes it obvious with his actions that I think he does, and I have tried to do the same. But whenever it comes down to saying the words, there is this completely crippling fear. I know it is normal to be nervous, but I just literally cannot do it. I don't know if this is because its admitting to myself that it is true and I've become vulnerable or what. ? In my past relationships, I have been the first to say it and haven't had nearly as much of a problem doing it. 
 Basically, though, I don't think it is fair that he is always putting himself out there so much and I am always on the receiving end. It feels like he is always taking the risks of putting himself out there for me, whereas I have remained closed-off from fear and even punish him for my ex's mistakes. (at several points he has brought this up, since it can make it seem like I am not as interested in the relationship as he is) I don't want to stay ""damaged"" forever. So is there a way I can try to gradually get over my fear enough to say those 3 words? Or even lead a conversation into that territory somehow?",Girl (23) with extreme fear of trust has problems letting her bf (26) who is her world know that she loves him.,23,F,relationships
"Apologies up front for this not being a SEVERE problem, but it's really tearing me up and i'm curious to get some feedback from this community. Here's the scoop:  I've been with my GF [28F] for 6 months, and we both seem to really dig where our relationship is headed. We're very attracted to one another (physically/psychologically), love to laugh and spend time together, and overall I feel like we are extremely compatible.  There is however 1 area we keep bumping in to that is proving to be problematic, which manifests itself in multiple ways.  She is a Korean adoptee (grew up in US, was adopted when she was 6-7 months old) and has by my estimation an extremely difficult time with trust & intimacy.  Here are my observations: 
 1) I will often times find myself fielding questions from her that overtly expose the fact that she is fearful I will leave her. 
 2) I will often show affection towards her (physical, doing something for her, leaving a sweet note, etc...) that will not be reciprocated or even acknowledged. If I say something about it, she will gladly reciprocate/acknowledge, however the fact that she does not feel at all compelled to show affection back in these situations strikes me as very odd and...cold, frankly. 
 3) Anything even remotely resembling constructive feedback is met with her shutting down and looking like a sad puppy that I just kicked in the face. Conversation ends, and we must wait until sad puppy turns back into happy puppy (sometimes a few hours, sometimes a few days).  I then continue (VERY gently) providing some constructive feedback and...you guessed it...sad puppy immediately comes back.  I find this particularly odd in light of the fact that she has a Masters degree in counseling. 
 4) Some of my favorite topics of discussion (science, philosophy, politics, etc...) make her feel immediately overwhelmed and fearful.  I get the sense that she doesn't want to talk and share any opinions out of fear for providing the ""wrong"" answer...but these topics are an important part of my intellectual ""diet"", and not sharing even rudimentary conversation/ideas on these topics kills me! 
 5) She repeatedly (& unintentionally) exposes the fact that she has yet to forgive me for extremely petty things that I've already genuinely apologized for, in some cases more than once. 
 I am more than willing to elaborate on any of the above points...and i'd also like to add that I consider myself to be someone of very honest, objective, caring, and calm demeanor.  Her reactions to me really leave me scratching my head, especially when I remain calm, supportive, and focused on creating positive energy out of our interactions.  Do these strike you as red flags, or are they things that can be drastically changed as her trust & affection for me grows?  Or do I strike you as someone who is inadvertently feeding in to these issues somehow?  I've never experienced anything like this with any past friends, family, girlfriends, etc...  Any feedback would be much appreciated! ;)","My GF [28F] is a Korean adoptee, and seems to have issues relating to intimacy/trust. Are these red flags? Or simply growing pains?",28,M,relationships

"Last weekend, I got pretty drunk (as usual) with my roommates and friends. 
 Let me preface this story by telling you ladies how ridiculously uncomfortable I am about my stomach. I HATE it. I'm 5'1"", ~147lbs, though I have a large frame, so I hold my weight somewhat well. That being said, the sight of my stomach makes me want to curl up in a ball and die. I lived through years of my family berating me about it. 
 From my sisters disbelieving that my stomach looked skinny, and that I wasn't sucking in. I was 6; my mom, disgusted, exclaiming, ""Oh my god, you look  pregnant ! Look at your love handles!"" followed by my older sister and neighbor laughing, asking where the boy was. I was 10; to my younger sister literally shielding her eyes any time my stomach showed, FOR YEARS, even if it was an accident. started when I was 12; to my dad asking me repeatedly whether I, ""really need that piece of pizza,"" or, ""When was the last time you worked out"" while looking me up and down. He only recently stopped; to the time my neighbor said, ""You would look so hot if you lost some weight,"" and when I lamented this to my older sister, she responds with, ""Well, he's right."" I was 17. I could go on and on and on. So ta-da! I hate the way I look. 
 ANYWAYS 
 My roommate and I are in my room, pretty drunk and high. Somehow (I don't know how I built the nerve... maybe I finally found a friend I truly love and trust), I cried out, ""Joan! I hate my stomach! It's so disgusting! I want it to go away!"" and I lift up my shirt, hunch over to show all the fat, pouring over my waistband, and look at her expectantly. I don't know what I was expecting. 
 Now, I see my roommate as someone with an ""acceptable stomach"" or one that I would like to have. There's fat on it, but not ""too much"" and I'm constantly jealous of it. 
 She responded by lifter HER shirt up, saying, ""Ijobuby! I hate my stomach too! Besides, our stomachs are the same exact size! And you look fine! And so do I! YOU'RE FINE."" I was baffled. 
 First of all, I could NOT believe that our stomachs are the same size (they aren't!). Second, it was crazy to see this person whose stomach is something I envy, hate it so much! I mean, is anyone really happy with themselves? I hear girls talk about it, and I'm envious of them. How freeing it would feel satisfied with my looks. 
 Essentially, I learned that everyone goes through body image issues. I've heard it, but it never really sunk in, because I always thought my body was the worst. I constantly think everyone is better than me. Hearing my roommate say that we looked the same, and that she has her own issues, made me realize that we're all in this together!

"Me [29/m] and [24/f] my girlfriend have only been going out for around four months and used to talk every day for hours at a time. She has a pain condition that makes it so she sleeps a lot when she's not at work. This affects any plans we have since they can be cancelled in the morning or only hours before we're supposed to meet. 
 I deal with it because I put her and her needs first always. Openness and honesty were big keys that were stressed from both of us, so I figured if there was ever an issue it would be brought up. 
 She lives with her parents and I on my own and we both work out seprate jobs, seeing each other a couple times a week. 
 While we talked about sex a lot and aspects of it a lot, we've only had sex a handful of times because her medication ""might"" affect her sex drive (it does even though she doesn't want to admit it, because this started when she was on it for the pain). I worry about initiating sex all the time because I worry she might feel used for sex, my ex told me this so it's always in the back of my head. 
 She's recently told me she felt distant and mentioned out of concern that we don't have as much of a connection as she had hoped. Also she didn't feel like she loved me, but still cared for me and wanted to still make things work. She told me this out of worry for how she was feeling and didn't want me to worry since she cares too much for me. 
 This worried me though because she wouldn't tell me why she felt this way or offer to talk about it further. I'm a generally paranoid person after being taken advantage of because I'm a kind, generous and person and friend. She knows about my past with people and friends taking advantage of my trust and kindness and said she'd never do that. I also have trust issues from that and my last ex cheating on me last year. 
 Everything up to this point was perfect and I felt and could read she was extremely happy. Fast forward a couple weeks and I feel she's distant: less texts, quality isn't there as far as the conversations we were having and just a undertone of unease. I worry that I when I told her I love her and that she's the best thing to ever happen to me, that she didn't know how to handle that, so she tried distancing herself instead. She wouldn't talk to me in person about what was wrong and va text she said I was raising her anxiety and stress and to just tone it down. 
 I did and her behavior towards me continued, raising red flags. I shouldn't have, but I looked at her phone and found out she has been telling her friend that she's breaking up with me as soon as she gets some senior pictures I had taken for a friend of hers, but doesn't want to right now and not risk getting the photos. Then I found out she's been talking to two other guys in depth and what I would consider cheating for the sex talk and same type of conversation I had with her before we started going out. 
 This crushed me because I have my trust issues and this felt like betryal and cheating. What's worse is she hasn't wanted to talk to me about any issues were having and I keep trying, not knowing what had been going on under my nose this whole time. 
 So knowing this I'm devastated and don't know how to go from here. Do I bring up that I know she's talking to other guys behind my back and do I then say HOW I know this? I sent her an email hinting that I have suspicions about that and I hope she isn't using me for those photos. She hasn't mentioned it and whenever I bring up the email asking if she's read it she says it slipped her mind and her inbox has a lot in it so she's sorry. 
 Through the phone texts I found out she wasn't originally attracted to me as much because I wasn't her type when we first started talking, but gave me a chance because I was a really nice guy who would put her and what she needed first. I think since her feelings of attraction hasn't grown as much as she's hoped so far, she might feel like we're failing, but I don't understand why she doesn't seem to want to work on things. 
 Do I give her the photos since I'm nice and  keep my promises? Do I break it off with her or can this be salvaged? To be fair in her defense I did come on strong when I told her how I felt, but she didn't tell me how that made her feel and it took me this long to realize I shouldn't have let myself go too far too fast (everything was progressing smoothly before that with I like you and there's a bond between us said by us both). 
 I know she has doubts because she wants to find that perfect person and feels she might be settling for less with me and is young enough she's got more time to look still. So I'm wondering if part of this is her seeking to find that connection and wanting to run away from me who wants to be with her because I feel the way I do about her. 
 How should I approach this? 
 Edit: She did say to her friend that she doesn't want to hurt me or crush me too much, so wants to let me down easy but I don't think wants to be the one to break it off. So how do I go about telling her I guess would be the next step?","Relationship going well and she had feelings for me too.

"crossposting from r/depression... wrong place, it seems!) 
 Long time for me on reddit, so I felt the need to make a throwaway. I'm a grown man, in my mid-to-late-twenties, not a college or high school student, which kind of makes me feel worse about all of this for some reason. 
 I fell head over heels for a girl, just a couple of years younger than me. Let's call her Janet. The first time I've ever felt this way, despite my many relations with women over the course of the last decade or so. We got into it really quickly, and soon we were spending a lot of time together. Fast forward about 8 months into this relationship, and we break up in the beginning of spring. I found out that Janet had been going out and she got some phone numbers, went on a few dates, let a couple of people fondle her and make out... and I guess I broke it off before she went any further with anyone. I was fucking devastated. 
 I left her and she seemed really regretful, but I was too hurt. Her best friend, Vero, really understood me then, because she had also recently broken up... with one of my closest friends, Tom, who I've known and trusted deeply for a good 4 years. 
 Vero and I hang out and we get drunk, and she makes a move on me. We stop, and continue as normal. She tells me about the guys she's been with since she broke up, why they broke up, and eventually, she takes off her clothes. Drunk and horny, we go at it, but I don't go further than going down on her because I can't bare betraying Tom and Janet any more than I already have, despite how much she asked me to go all the way with her. 
 She made me promise to never tell anyone, cause she said it would kill everyone's friendship. This was over a year ago. I resent her more and more, and I'm realizing this is why. I keep a nice face on, but inside, I feel like I'm breaking apart. We all got back together eventually, and I've never had the same friendship with Vero ever again, like she dislikes me now, like she has the same nice face on that I do. I broke it off with Janet a second and final time, because I realized she really can't be with me without her wanting to fuck other dudes and chicks, so I gave her the opportunity and I want no part of her relationship anymore, despite how much we still apparently care for oneanother. I've felt Vero is the reason for Janet becoming this way. 
 And now, I don't know what to do. Do I keep burying this secret, and can I get over it one day? Or should I tell Tom and Janet, and risk losing all of my friends for what I've done... I regret it so much.","Drunk, buddy's ex gf & my ex's best friend tried to fuck me, I went down on her instead. They got back together almost a year later.

"Hey guys, hope you're well. 
 So this isn't a chuckaway account but an account I can use for this sub-Reddit. 
 So a little bit about me and anxiety.
I'm 24, live in the UK and been diagnosed with anxiety (which effects me in many ways).
I wouldn't say I'm fully depressed, sometimes I do feel low and sometimes I feel empty but not all the time.
My anxiety is more than often most the time ofc when I'm relaxed listening to music I'm fine and all is good. 
 The worst part of my anxiety is i feel like i have constant health issues :(
I got a issue with my Asthma which annoys my anxiety in a way that i will think about it and it will get worst (Doesn't help I have chest pains).
My heart is a weird one as I can't take pulse because my heart reading will shoot just thinking about it, for example it did the other day; I took 3 different readings which went up and pulptations (Had a heart reader on which said i was fine) I sometimes move around so I can't feel heart beat when lying down/sitting up.
I only suffered a few panic attacks which were in the same night which woke me up.
(This is a few concerns I have, I live with some, hospitals gives me anxiety (GPs not as bad). 
 I use to think of anxiety as paranoia until I spoke to others with it, it controls my life more than I would like it too.
I will always have something on my mind which worrys me, including: 
 
 Money and my future 
 
 Making list, i always make list 
 
 Health (one thing wrong and i think the worst) 
 
 not so much social anxiety as im a funny out going guy which is good 
 
 I get embarrassed over little things 
 
 My car gaining miles 
 
 Always think Ive done something wrong 
 
 I suffer BDD after getting dumped because i blamed my looks 
 
 doing stuff alone (most things) 
 
 I use to worry what people think about me but im not as bad any-more 
 
 I often fail at agreements because my thoughts are bad when it comes to a verbal fight 
 
 I also feel like I don't have it as I don't have some of the same issues as others with it 
 
 ect ect I guess there's more (Your welcome to ask questions) 
 
 
 I decided to seek help as I feel like its getting worst after being told I could have a major health issue
so I went to the doctor and got given some pills and got offered theory (only had 6 pills so far so no effect yet)

 I am much wider than her.  shoulders, wingspan, leg length, etc.  I dont think it's ""fair"" to split the bed down the middle and to be honest its not even down the middle.  She usually ends up with 2/3-3/5 because she likes to cuddle before she falls asleep.  I like cuddling too, for 5 minutes, after sex and during naps lol.  But she gets clammy so fast! Anyway.  We have a king sized bed but also 3 dogs and a cat who jump on and off so it gets crowded fast.  If you dont establish territory early you end up curled up in a ball. 
 So, is this something I am just going to have to live with? It's not the end of the world it just seems unreasonable.  When we go hiking I obviously carry more weight, When we bring the groceries in I carry more bags, so why don't I get the bigger piece of cookie and larger portion of the bed?","My beautiful, tiny, clammy, selfish wife doesnt realize she is a petite bed hogging, food stealing jerkface.",26,M,relationships
"I'm a 17 yr old male. Started dating a girl about 4 months ago, and its going great so far. I'll attempt to lay down what is going on in our sex life, and my main questions. 
 Before her, I had never even TOUCHED a girl. Absolutely nothing. She was my first kiss, my first sexual experience. Everything. I'm still a virgin, we haven't done the real deed yet. 
 She is NOT a virgin. She has had two previous boyfriends, and has told me those are the only two she's had REAL sex with. There have been a few drunken ""hookups"" here and there but she hasn't done it with random strangers. Naturally this means she is more experienced than me (which in itself is highly intimidating). 
 Most of the time our dates involve driving around in my car, doing something fun, and then ending up doing something sexual. The first time I did anything sexually related with her was when we were in the backseat of my car, with her laying across my lap. We were making out, obviously, and I ended up messing around with her breasts (hers are gloriously HUGE), which lasted for a few minutes before we were caught by a police officer (told to leave the area). About 2 weeks into our relationship I ended up in a situation where I was fingering her for the first time. It DID NOT GO WELL. It was my first time fingering a girl...much less seeing a girls bare body IRL and I had no idea what I was doing. She had me stop after 5 minutes and basically said I wasn't really that good and she didn't enjoy it. She was very sweet about explaining to me that it was just a matter of time of figuring her out and whatnot, even though I was despairing like mad. 
 Fast forward a few dates, and I am now apparently a fingering GOD in her eyes. I gave her (what she claimed was) her first orgasm (she can't even give herself one apparently). I can now give her multiple orgasms and have figured out exactly where, how hard, and how fast she likes it. Which is GREAT. Here is where one problem arises, she is now DYING to have me go down on her. No guy has ever done it to her, and she wants it badly. I want to do it to her too, I am just hesitant about a few things. One, she smells...""funny"" down there. Not bad, just different. Enough to make me not want to dive right in. I also don't know if i will be repulsed by the act (she gets EXTREMELY wet when she's turned on). She also is kind of hairy...I'd be much more comfortable doing it if she was completely smooth. Another, I am extremely paranoid about STI's and HIV and the like. I've only brought up the subject of testing with her once, and she didn't react well. She hasn't been tested (neither have I) and she says she doesn't have anything. She implied that it was a matter of trust that we both shouldn't have to worry about it, and she's never once asked me if I have anything or if I've been tested. 
 This is the MOST we've done. She recently had a major surgery on her jaw which makes it impossible for her to give me a BJ for the time being. Which is fine. Last night was incidentally the first time she has ever seen me (somewhat) naked IRL. She had been telling me for days that she had a ""surprise"" for me, which turned out to be her trying to give me a handjob. She unfortunately was not able to make me ""go"". And she seemed to be pretty embarrassed/ felt bad about it. (Reminds me of my first time with her). I told her it was okay and I didn't expect her to know exactly how I do it. She did manage to do a little bit of licking and kissing, which only felt good in CERTAIN places, and here arises another question. The actual ""head"" of my penis felt fairly non responsive to her kissing it, as in, I didn't know she was kissing the head until I looked down and saw her doing it. What I really felt was her tongue up and down my shaft and along the back where the foreskin attaches to the head. This worries me, isn't this supposed to be an extremely erogenous area? Touching it with fingers is VERY sensitive and it hurts in some cases, why is it non-reactive to lips or tongue? 
 Branching off of that, I am uncircumcised (Indian, not part of our culture). She has no experience with an uncircumcised penis. Is there any way I can make it easier for her? Its hard to describe to her how exactly to jack me off...I only know myself. 
 My penis is also very temperamental. It will go hard at the most inopportune moments. For example, making out with her will make me go hard, but having her hand down my pants elicits not even the tiniest movement down there. It drives me insane, and makes me fear that I might have an early form of ED. (I used to masturbate multiple times a day, but realized what it was doing to me and started nofap, been going strong for almost 2 months without masturbating). The fact that I am sliightly UNDER average size makes this more stressful for me. I expressed my worry of her thinking im inadequate to her and she assured me that my size was fine and she was not displeased, and was content. I still feel like she's just saying that to not hurt my feelings. 
 She has also recently stated that she is ready to have sex. Dear god. I told her fairly early that I was ready to take the next step, she wanted to, but just wasn't ready. Now she is, and I'm freaking out. I have no idea what to do in terms of condoms (how to buy one without being embarrassed, how to get the right size, etc etc.) And..it will be my first time..with a girl who has experience, will it really be as horrible as people say it is? Or am I just psyching myself out.","Intimdated by a girl with more experience (2 previous partners)

"This is a throw away account for obvious reasons. I apolgize in advance for any spelling/grammatical errors, I'm an idiot and on my mobile. 
 OK so, back to Tuesday night,  my current SO(m37) and I(f 23) had sex and the night before as well, so my vagina was a little sore, but to be expected. He had just returned from the east coast from his home trip. (he is here for work) So after sex on Tuesday we fell right asleep and I ended up not peeing after he came (bad idea I know, but it felt so nice falling asleep in his arms.  And Fuck me  because I ALWAYS pee after since I am prone to yeast infections) Wednesday at work I notice an odor and some discharge and it was kind of sore,  like I said,  but I attributed the soreness to fucking vigorously for two nights in a row. So I think, ""Shit,  a yeast infection"" so I'm opt out of the usual going to planned parenthood and getting a prescription antibiotic, because shit, ain't nobody got time for that. So (naturally) I look to reddit for cheap remedies. I see soaking a tampon in yogurt and sticking it up there for maybe an hour a day usually helps. So I do this. But I noticed this time is a bit different there isn't really any cottage cheese discharge, just milky discharge. I think ""OK maybe it's just a little different this time"" 
 So Friday night rolls around.  Me and my SO obviously hadn't been boning since that Tuesday night due to my ""yeast infection"". I get a text telling me that he has a spot on his penis and he doesn't think yogurt is gonna clear it up. 
 Panic mode. 
 I immediately doubt him.  Telling it's PPP (pearly penile papules). He assured me that no they aren't and that he's never had them before. So I'm like ""fuck"" and start checking my shit more thoroughly. I had been bending over in the mirror prior to this because this ""yeast infection""  was surprisingly more itchy than any one I had before. But I noticed nothing. 
 But then I saw it.  A little red splotch just on the inside of my right labia minora, more towards the back. There it is. That's definitely what I think it is. 
 So since it was Friday when this happened, I have to wait til tomorrow (Monday) before I even can make an appt. 
 Our history (because I think it's important): we met August 2012 and started dating until December when I met some one else who seemed more serious. Like I said my current SO was here for work and we didn't know how long he was going to be here (not military). So I'm in that relationship until about July or so. After that we (current SO) started seeing each other again because we still liked each other and I only broke up with him because the new guy wanted exclusivity and,  you know,  lived here permanently.  So in between getting back together with him I have a one night stand (condom of course, it was bad break up). I feel gross after that and get tested a few days later. They say come back in two weeks,  because if you got anything it will take 2 to 20 days to show symptoms. I go back and get tested, not for the herp because no symptoms and I've never had any so I didn't get the blood test. Good news,  I'm clean. I thought. 
 So is it weird we showed symptoms for the first time for both of us? Ever? At the same time? 
 We have been faithful. I trust him when he tells me when he hasn't been with anyone else be sides me and one other person earlier in the year (2013) before we got back together. He feels just as shitty as I do. I can see the concern and worry in his face. I know he thinks I did something during the time I was with him but I have not. It doesn't matter I don't and am not wanting to blame him. But we are definitely extremely upset about the whole situation.",is it normal of herpes symptoms to show in partners at the same time if neither person has ever had symptoms before? Ever?,23,F,sex
"Hi. I posted this on /r/seduction, i wasn't sure where it would be better to make this post. 
 Im 18, and this is the first girl I've ever had a date with, so you can say im inexperienced. I've had two dates with her so far, i haven't even kissed her yet, tho i tried to steal a kiss from her on the first date. Anyways, this girl is giving me a huge headache because it's a major issue to even setup a date with her. the first date she arrived 1 hour late, the second date almost didn't happen ( we had a really good time in both dates ), and it's been two or three weeks now and she keeps making excuses to why she cant go on dates, (she has a job and studies fashion design) though she is the one setting most of them up! I wanted to confront her about it, but a friend told me it could be true ( he's studying graphic design so i thought he might know something about it). Now i really, really regret it tho, since i told her to setup a date when she's absolutely sure she will have time, but i lost all control and now i have no idea when she's going to say anything ( if ever ). 
 I don't think she's lost interest or is avoiding me since she follows me on instagram and has commented on my most recent picture ~1 week ago. 
 I must also mention this whole issue started right after she started studying again, which makes it likely that she is busy, but... it's been like 4, 5 dates that she has canceled, first couple time it didn't even bothered me, but now it's just pissing me off. 
 Am i reading way too much into this? How can someone be this irresponsible? My main idea is for her to set the date so if she cancels this time, i can now confront her and probably dont talk to her again, unless she says something that really convinces me, but how do i regain the control of the situation? because right now im just waiting for a text message that may or may never come. How can i reengage in text messages with her without being seen as pushy or needy?

"My boyfriend and I, we're both 21, have been on a rocky sort of relationship for awhile. We've been dating 11 months, and for the most part, it is awesome. I love him very much. 
 The problem is though, that he's only had one other relationship before me, and it was online, for 3 years. (I don't even want to get into how fucked up it was...) So I can understand him being a little new at things, and not sure how to treat me sometimes. But it's getting to a ridiculously frustrating point. He doesn't do ANYTHING for me, not one thing on his own, absolutely nothing around the apartment (We do live together, but we have a lot of time on our own, to be apart, I visit family once a week and we work different hours/school), I clean up, do the laundry, dishes, clean the bedroom; if I ask him to do something he always just says ""I'll get to it..."" And doesn't for a few days. 
 The thing that really bothers me though, is his lack of...I'm not sure, showing he loves me? He'll say that he loves me, and we'll cuddle and hold hands and do some cutesy things like that, but there are just so many little things that bother me that I think he should do, and maybe I'm completely out of line. It's just consideration. A few examples: 
 We went to a concert last night, he drives on a motorbike, so we took that to the concert, and had to put our helmets in our bookbags. Mine apparently didn't fit, I didn't know until I got there. I asked him if he could hold on to my helmet for 15 minutes so I could stretch, and grab us a drink and he refused, saying he had too much stuff already. I had my bookbag, my helmet, and all of his stuff, like his wallet, cell phone, keys, camera in my bookbag. He had his helmet in his bag, that was it. 
 Another example, we lost our apartment key, so our roommate set up the buzzer to his cellphone to let us get in, until we have our key. If I'm coming in from the bus stop, I'll ask him to come let me in, so I don't have to bother buzzing my roommate to let me in, all the time. He says no, he's in the middle of his video game (that he religiously plays). I can understand that you don't want to get up and be interrupted, but EVERY TIME? You can't stop for 2 seconds to come let me in, once? I don't ask all the time either because I don't mind buzzing most of the time, but sometimes it'd be nice.... 
 I write little love notes around the apartment, on his Facebook wall, send him emails, private msgs, sexy texts etc. I get none back, I've made a point of being like ""It'd be sweet if you'd respond to one sometime"" he just says ""Oh, I saw it, then I got busy. Thanks though"" and then writes all over his friends facebook walls, and sends them texts etc. I know that's a dumb thing to be upset about, but something as small as a ""Love you!"" text would brighten up my day. 
 There are a ton more examples I could bring up, but the main issue I find is that I do things for him, out of excitement to see him happy, and he does nothing for me, when he DOES do something, he bitches and complains about it like he didn't want to in the first place. I've tried talking about it with him, to let him know I feel that way, but then he turns it into my fault saying I nag him about it, but I don't. I've brought it up maybe twice in our entire relationship, in a positive way even. I wasn't accusatory or bitchy, I was just suggestive. 
 Am I wrong? If not what are some ways that I can let him know that this is bothering me, maybe I'm not saying it in the right way...","Boyfriend isn't appreciating anything I do for him, and isn't showing me that he loves me, by doing sweet things and it just bothers me, what can I do?",21,M,relationships
"Just got into an argument with my SO 21F which was pretty much initiated by ""my mum still sleeps with me occasionally"". 
 Just to make things clear, I have 2 other siblings and she sleeps with them as well, but it's not the whole night, just around half an hour maximum. There is obviously no touching at all, back faced towards her and because I'm such a heavy sleeper, sometimes I don't even know she crawled in and out. 
 SO is a very shyish? (Don't know the word) person and won't even let her family members hug, kiss touch her at all.

"Hi, throwaway here. I need advice/suggestions from other people who are or have been in my situation.  I've also cross posted in R/long distance (hope that's ok!). 
 I'm (f27) in a LDR with my SO (28m). We've been together for 5 years and long distance for 3. I work in a highly specialised field that takes years of training (though not one that pays especially well). He works in the creative industry and whilst has been getting steadily more work over the last 3 years, barely makes the minimum wage. 
 Last year I moved to a different country for work. I'm finding it very difficult and lonely (big city, don't know anyone): he's at home, settling in socially and finding his niche. I already feel guilty asking him to move over to stay with me. He tells me that he will be giving up a potentially lucrative career to do so. 
 However, at the moment he is earning very little and if he does move over, I will have to move flat (I need to prove I have room for him on the visa application) which in this city would bring my rent to over double what it is (and over half my pay check) and I will need to pay for food, bills etc while he 'works on his portfolio' and applies for jobs. He says it may take up to six months to find a job in his field and he refuses to take 'just any job' to help out in the meantime. 
 I'm kind of baulking at this. I understand he is ambitious: we both are, but I can't help feeling it's unfair that I get to feel guilty for taking away him away from his 'potential' career and have to take a huge hit financially until he finds another one that suits him. I have discussed this with him but it just results in him getting cross and me upset.

"At the age of 19 I was dating my boyfriend long distance. He's several years older than me and lived about 1000 miles away. I worked for an airline so I would fly standby and visit him quite frequently. 
 I was there visiting in January, we'd gone to his friend's house and they were starting to watch a zombie movie. Not a fan of zombies myself I suggested we go see the movie we'd talked about going to earlier. We hopped in the car, got out on the highway and were on our way. 
 Understand, this was winter and the roads were icy and it had started snowing while we were at his friend's house.

"READ FIRST: So before daring to get into this mass of text, know that I have never had a girlfriend. I have never kissed a girl, I have never asked a girl out. This is all new to me and I have no clue what to do. 
 I am (M,19) and a freshman in college. In the beginning of October, I met this girl (18) through a female friend who lived in my hall. We talked for a couple minutes and she left. That night, she sent my a Facebook friend request, which I accepted. We hung out for the first time the next night, along with a couple other guys and girls. All of us hanging out together becomes a regular thing and we create a tight friend group. Two weeks after meeting this girl and hanging out with her three times, she gives me her phone number. 
 As October progresses, we begin texting. It starts out as every couple days generally about what the plans are for the group that night. We joke around a bit, talk about classes and stuff, but it's all pretty bland conversations. By the time November rolls around, I have a crush on this girl. By this time too, we have become closer just through casual texting and hanging out frequently. 
 We start texting each other almost everyday. A lot of our conversations go into the wee hours of the morning. She comes over to my roommate and myself's dorm more frequently to study for tests or just hangout. I generally walk her home if she stays over late. Over Thanksgiving break, we talked to each other all day long for the days we had off. She texted me at 2 am one night because she was having what she called a ""meltdown"" and we talked until 5 am. 
 We come back from break and we still text almost everyday and hangout with our friends. I noticed though that most times when we hangout with everyone, eventually the two of us will have our own private conversation away from everyone else. We don't plan it, it just happens. I went to a concert out of town with her, her friend, and her roommate. We stayed at her house for two nights and I met her mom, who had already heard about me. 
 We come back after the concert weekend with a few weeks left in the semester. She comes over almost every night to study in my room. We have more one on one talks whenever we all hangout and we begin catching each other staring if we are across a room. We have a Secret Santa gift exchange for our friends and she happened to have randomly picked me. She gave me a very personalized gift that must have taken her hours to do and was very thoughtful. Although I did not pick her name, I still gave her a gift which she was very happy and thankful about. 
 The last night before Winter Break, I go to her dorm for what was planned to just be an hour but I ended up staying for almost 9 and I went back to my dorm to pack around 6 am. She texts me the first day of break and we talk until early morning. But after getting advice from my friends who have actually had healthy relationships with girls (or any relationship with a girl), they told me to ignore her which will only make her want me more. 
 So for the first time in a month, I didn't talk to her. The next day she texted me twice and has texted me first everyday this whole break. We had planned over break for her to come hangout with me and some of my friends from back home at a local amusement park. 
 That day ended up being yesterday and through some fate, two of my friends couldn't go last minute and my third friend and his brother left early before this girl arrived. I texted her saying all my friends left and it was just me but she still wanted to come. We spent the whole afternoon and evening just the two of us. And it started raining so must of the rides closed, so we just talked for hours. 
 So as a relationship virgin, I don't know if given these circumstances if this girl likes me or if I am just a friend to her. If it is the former, where do I go from here? I have zero idea on how, if she did like me, I would go about asking her out or anything like that.","I met this girl a few months ago and I think she may like me and I really like her.

"2 weeks into my freshman year at college, 4 girls invited me to go down to Tijuana, Mexico to go to a club (they thought they'd be safer with at least 1 guy going.) I go, and proceed to get blackout drunk real fast ($10 cover, unlimited drinks.) I woke up in a drunk tank in San Diego, missing only my watch. 
 I was later told by others that were there that 2 bouncers took me out of the club and put me in a Mexican taxi, and just told the guy to take me to the border.

"Alright, my girlfriend and I have been together for about 2 years now. She moved to start grad school last September and I was lucky enough to find work at the same university. We moved in together and slowly began sorting out all the things that entails. We had heard all the horror stories, so we sat down early and split up chores so we both knew what was expected. From my end, things were going fine. Apparently they weren’t. 
 I don’t like spending time with her new grad school friends. Many of her coworkers were dismissive of me (she works in the arts and I’m an engineer), and they all pick at each other. They would say nasty comments about other diners while we were out at dinner, badmouthing other students behind their back, that sort of thing. And, what really bothered me, my girlfriend would participate. I understand the need to fit in with a new group, particularly since we moved a fair distance so she could go to school, but this behavior isn’t becoming to her, nor is it something I’m willing to let slide.  So, as tactfully as I could, I brought up my issues to my girlfriend, in private. And the water works started. And I’m a pussy when it comes to crying girls. And nothing got discussed. I spent the next couple of days reassuring her that I wasn’t leaving because her friends are snarky and disrespectful. And now I just don’t hang out with them, but I normally get a guilt trip when I decline. 
 And so it’s progressed with nearly every semi-serious issue we have. I bring something up, even as mundane as “please rinse out dishes before you leave them in the sink” (dishes are my job), end in tears and her saying “I’m so worried I’m going to screw this up”. Yes, she bloody well is if she keeps that up. 
 Then we hit the big one. We’d both put on weight since we started dating and after we moved I decided to do something about my expanding waist line. I was on the weightlifting team in high school and college and I decided to get into the more fitness/bodybuilding end of things. I joined the YMCA and invited her to join me. Not told her she was getting fat. To paraphrase it was “I’m going start going to the Y and they’ve got a pool if you want to swim while I lift”. Maybe I told her she was fat in girlspeak. I don’t know. 
 And now it’s a struggle to get her to do anything remotely athletic. I would invite her to walk with me in the evening (the university we’re at is beautiful) and it turned into “walking the girlfriend” and earned me a few evenings of sour looks. And now she’s decided that she doesn’t want to eat the stuff I cook anymore. I’m trying to clean up my diet, but I’m not being insane about this. Less beer and more salads, that kinda thing. But now we’re each cooking for ourselves, me having something resembling healthy, her eating cheese and noodles or something. And she’s gotten heavier which has lead to less frequent sex. 
 I’m sure there’s an element of us just getting used to being around each other all the time, but I’m genuinely less physically attracted to her. Which lead to me trying to get her to come do active things with me, cause you don’t tell your girl she’s getting fat. So we started doing it less frequently until, inevitably, she asked “are you less attracted to me because I’m getting heavier?” And, perhaps stupidly, I told her the truth. and she cried, and I consoled her. 
 I don’t want to leave her, but I want to actually be able to discuss the issues in our relationship without getting stonewalled by tears. Maybe it’s over, I don’t know. I just feel like I’m the only one trying to work on the relationship and that maybe I’m only sticking around because it’s a familiar and comfortable thing in a strange new town.

Making myself sick over the worry that someone would find out we were sleeping in a car. Sometimes I couldn't find a safe place to park so I would drive all night while she slept. I didn't want them to find out and take her. 
 When I had enough money I tried to get an abortion but I was to far along. I finally was able to get into some low income housing. I slept on the floor and worked 40-50 hours on my feet. Hard physical work. I was able to get some government assistance (food stamps). But Because I worked so Much i never qualified for welfare or daycare vouchers. Which was a catch 22 because If I stopped working so much I couldn't afford rent, water and power. Which was ALL we had. 
 The worst part was the pain my daughter went through. She was devastated. I felt like I was already dead on the inside. To this day I wonder if she ever heard me up crying all night.  I just kept trying to muscle through it. I tried to make the most out of the few moments I could spend with her. I would only get 2-330 on the weekdays and Saturday when she woke up to 230. Other then that she was either sleeping, at school or I was working. 
 I worked till 2-3 am then picked her up from the sitters. Then I would carry my 5 year old up three flights of stairs and lay her in her bed so she wouldn't be woken up at that hour. 
 Around month 7 I started peeing blood and also peeing on myself. The dr chalked it up to baby sitting on bladder. So at 25 years old I was wearing adult diapers so I wouldn't pee blood all over myself at work. 
 Went into labor at like 29 weeks. The hospital said at first that my child couldn't stay with me. So I pulled my IV's , got dressed and asked for paper work at the nurses desk to check out.  Even though I felt like death from the drugs they gave me. They let her stay with me for 24 hours. Then I checked out AMA because I had to get her back to school and myself back to work. 
 I resented my son. I hated him. I never once looked at an ultrasound picture. No one ever smiled for my son. No one ever looked forward to him. He was the baby that nobody wanted.  I dreamed of waking up to see that I had miscarried. I fantasized of driving my car off a bridge or putting a gun in my mouth. If It was not for my daughter I have no doubt I would have. 
 I was able to finally afford a used laptop and began looking into adoption. I picked out a family and they started to help me out financially which was a huge help. I was fully prepared to give away the baby. I couldn't wait. 
 Then randomness. My ex somehow got wind and served me with court papers. Court battle for the unborn baby started. The adoption agency had a lawyer and so did my ex. I couldn't afford one. So I went around town BEGGING someone to take a payment plan. After days of groveling on my hands and knees I finally found someone who would.  After lots of confusing legal things and many stupid stupid laws. I was faced with giving my baby to my ex to raise to keeping it. 
 I kept it. I didn't want my son to turn out like his horrible father. I am legally forced to send him to his fathers every Wednesday and every other weekend. I was able to fight that for the first few months because I was breastfeeding. But he is two and a half now and I make the best of it. He seems like a normal little boy. He was an EXTREMELY easy baby. 
 It gets better. 
 When my son was 6 months old I met the most wonderful man in the world. I wasn't looking for anyone or interested in dating but it just happened. I don't have to worry anymore. I feel safe and happy. I have more in life then I ever thought possible, much more then I deserve. I finished my first degree. I am married. I have things in my own name now. I look back on what I went through like a war. I feel like I was in a battle for my life and I barely made it.","Yes, sometimes life is a horrible bitch.

"So I’m a senior in high school and I like this girl. Its not rly like most crushes and if you asked me if I loved her I would say yes. Not specifically because I think I love this girl but because I literally love everything about this girl. Let’s all be honest, In some of our crushes or girlfriends there are things we can pick out that we dislike or even mildly hate. That doesn’t exist with me. I literally love everything about her. So if you want to tell me it’s not love, fine, BUT then I would answer with, “This is how I imagine love is.” Anyway letssss get on with it. 
 So before I could ask her out the first time, she beat me to it with an “I’m not ready let’s just be friends.” Alright. Fine. Yaknow… wut.. Cool! She’s awesome I love hanging out with her and I can still be her friend she’s not ready no big deal. Second times come around a year later. I assume shes ready since we are still attracted to each other. I ask her out. She answers with an “I’m not sure, I need to pray about it. I’ll get back to you.” She never got back to me it was like 4 months ago. We had small misunderstanding and she told my friends she told me “No”. I get pissed …blah blah… don’t really talk to her. She gets upset telling me were great friends and I’m sorry for the misunderstanding, BUT never tells or states to me that is it a “No.” She simply stated that she meant she would get back to me eventually. 
 Well… great. 
 She continually treats me different from our other friends and we sometimes do things that a couple would do. Go to family dinner’s blah blah blah… I buy her presents on special occasions. (not becus she asks, but yakno I love her and stuff) Anyway she’ll basically leads on me hardcore thennnnn ignores me for a day or two. If I get pissed that she ignored me suddenly I am the one ignoring her and I’m the problem. Also If I ever state a statement or question saying “We didn’t rly talk too much today, or we didn’t get to hang a lot this week.” She becomes irritated becus she doesn’t want to think of us as a couple. Now a new year’s party happened and she ignored me the entire time and totted the guy before me around.( This is when I learned I wasn’t the first guy this was happening to. Apparently he got the same treatment before me.) I got pissed and didn’t talk to her for a day. She is confused now and thinks I am ignoring her. 
 (Apparently if I don’t go up to her and make conversation and ask to hang then to her that is – I am ignoring her. She doesn't come up to me. She posted a fb status about how guys need to pursue girls and don’t chase after guys. This was directed toward younger people in our youth group, but I feel it was toward me. AND I’m all like… HELLO!?! We aren’t dating! You can approach me I’m not your boyfriend.) 
 So I’ve been playin it hardcore and having a great time with other friends acting like nothing is wrong. When I have to talk to her I am polite and act like nothing is wrong, but never approach for a conversation or to hang out. I can tell something’s not right about her and she can feel that my presence isn’t wrapped around her anymore. So I expect her to talk to me about why we aren’t normal anymore, but nothing is 100% So my question to you reddit is what should I do? Should I continue this? I feel like I might hit something soon and will be giving the chance to express my valid points of her wrong behavior. 
 But who knows… my judgment might be clouded by ignorance and me being a little hurt. What do you guys think I should do?","Girls leads me on then ignores me, then if I respond negatively she gets upset. So I have been acting like she’s not my world.",18,M,relationship_advice

 I have a simple question for /r/sex... 
My SO has mentioned that she desires to wait until marriage (NOT for religious purposes, though we are both somewhat religious if it matters) before having full intercourse. We are both virgins. To date, we have done almost everything just short of intercourse, including oral and other fun things. Quite frankly, our physical relationship is incredible, and we really connect emotionally and spiritually whenever we get intimate. My SO and I are very in love, and I fully intend to marry her a few years down the road, but I have been bothered by the fact that we could be goaded into marriage by intercourse... I intend to bring it up with her sometime soon, just letting her know that I may not want to wait until we're married because I don't want sex to be the reason we're getting married. I was just thinking about telling her exactly what I've written here, pretty much, that I love her but sometime in a year or so, I may really want to have intercourse so it doesn't become a carrot baiting us into marriage, so to speak. 
 Let me reiterate, I don't intend to marry her within the next 3 years (and nor does she!! we have to finish school and make it on our own for a little while, first)... But is it so crazy to want to make sure I'm COMPLETELY compatible with her?","SO wants to wait until marriage (wouldn't be for another 4 years at least) but I don't want to feel baited into marriage just for sex. 
 EDIT: Shit, I'm a dumbass. I left out some important information. We are living in different cities (about 4 hrs apart) over the summer, but go to the same university but we see each other every couple of weeks in person. Otherwise we talk just about every day via phone, skype, etc.",19,M,sex
"Ok I'll try and keep it short. I (31m) have been with my girlfriend (27f) for 5 years now. For most of the relationship I will admit I took advantage of her. I constantly texted my ex wife whom I have a daughter with about meeting up or missing her but never actually followed through with it (still cheating I know). I emotionally neglected her, talked down to her, and all around acted like the biggest piece of shit on the planet. 
 Well she finally left me for another man. I deserve it and I know it should have happened sooner. The thing is when this happened something inside of me sparked. I am head over heels in love with her now. 
 I've gone over it in my head over and over and I honestly know it's not just because I can't have her or she's with someone else, this is honest to god love. We still live together and I see her every day. I've done the usual of begging, buying gifts, and doing anything to make her see I really care but she's still talking to this other guy. 
 They have been talking to each other for about 2 weeks and he is already texting her ""love you"" and other things you shouldn't to someone you've only known for that amount of time. This leads me to believe he is one of those guys I've known all my life that jumps head first into making a girl fall for him all the while saying it to other girls too. I just have a feeling I pushed her into his arms and he's only saying what he thinks she wants to hear or win some competition with me but means none of it. 
 The thing is I feel she is slowly coming around to me. While we're at home I offer to give her massages, which she now let's me do. I've given her hand written letters explaining myself and my feelings which she has kept, and she let's me hug her on the way out for work and when she gets home. When this happened 2 weeks ago she wouldn't even look at me or speak to me. 
 My question is this. How do I push her over the edge of seeing that what I'm saying is true and I am madly in love and would never take her for granted again? How do I get him out of the picture? I know words wont cut it and flowers and cooking dinner aren't enough. Any advice for a downing man?",My girlfriend left me for someone else and I want her back,31,M,relationships

"Hey all, 
 I [23M] am writing this partially to express myself, because I hold these feelings on the inside for the most part. I also would appreciate some feedback or help. I'm not sure if this belongs in r/breakups or r/ihave issues. This is broad enough that it'll fit here. 
 I was cheated on by my now-ex about a year ago. We tried to sort out the issues in our relationship. However, the trust issues remained. I knew I had to break up with her, and I did, about four months later. The entire relationship lasted a year and a half. Before the incident, I was incredibly in love with her, and I actually pictured myself marrying her at one point. I've never loved anyone as much. I don't think I could love anyone that much for a while. Right now, I'm glad this happened early enough in the relationship. It saved me a lot of trouble in the future. It did fuck me up, though. 
 I'm hurting when I think about it. I saw the signs, and I could have acted on it. I feel like I could have stopped things. I trusted her, so I didn't expect anything. I could feel something was wrong. The worst part was, the guy was extremely friendly to me whenever I was around him. I feel betrayed and hurt by her. I want to hate her. But, I have a lot of sympathy for her and like her. 
 My ex has issues from childhood. So, I don't blame her. She's weak and fragile. I think that's what attracted me to her. I wanted to protect and care for her. But, I also think that it's a crutch for certain bad behaviours. It turned out to sting me. 
 I don't feel like I'm the same person I was before. The break up and being cheated on left me weak and in pieces for numerous months. By the end of December, I finally felt like myself again. Occasionally, I felt badly. My ex came back into my life, crying, about her relationship with another guy that didn't work out. She was threatening to kill herself. Naturally, I wanted to help her out. We chatted, became friends, and that's that. I feel like I'm being used by her for attention occasionally. I decided I didn't want to put up with it anymore, so I started to remain distant. 
 I don't feel like I'm the same person I used to be. I'm still cheerful around people, but I'm less focused on success, and more focused on girls. I desire a really meaningful, passionate, beautiful relationship, but I feel that until I get my life straight again, I won't be able to attain it, or success. 
 anyway, any insight / help / advice is appreciated.","I was cheated on by my ex, and I'm still hurting nearly a year later. I don't feel like myself anymore.",23,M,BreakUps
"Sorry about the big story but please read, I(20) work with this girl (23)who lately I've got really close with, however she has a boyfriend. We started flirting/liking each other about a month ago, and the whole work group planned to go out last Saturday, we both knew something was going to happen, and it did, we kissed. 
 After that night she told me she did not know what to do, as she is in a relationship, she tells me she's not happy with him and hasn't been since before she even knew me. Yesterday she told me she was going to end it with him today, so she apparently tried but he said to her he would change...and she agreed to give him a chance. 
 Obviously I'm hurt, the last week since the kiss we've been talking a lot about being in a relationship, where we'd live, even talked about kids! She text me this morning saying she wants to try with him and give him a chance..I dont know what to do? I work with her aswell so it's going to be unbearable.

"My [ex?]friend [24F] and I [27F] go to a very intensive graduate school, and have been friends for about three years of the five year course. We bonded originally over both being unhappily single, and both recovering from very difficult break ups. 
 Originally she and I would hit the town most weekends to chat up new people, and as I was an active online dater, I made her up a profile and she and I both had multiple dates from them. Soon thereafter she met someone, and they dated for 6 months, until he dumped her. I of course was there for her throughout the end of the relationship, and took her out to help her forget him. She nearly immediately launched into a new relationship (also found online) but ended things with her as he didn't have enough ambition in life. Since then she's been single, saying ""she doesn't want to get in a relationship this close to graduation and moving away"", and she is ""fine being single"". She even ended things with her long term FWB because she didn't want anything serious. 
 
 Throughout all these relationships I've been dating people for no longer than a month, and never anything serious. I truly wanted something more permanent, and thus made efforts to find someone I could see a future with. I freely admit seeing her always having someone when I was only getting a long string of guys saying ""You're awesome, but I just don't want anything serious"", made me rather jealous. I had some difficulties adjusting when she wasn't single, and thus didn't want to go out to bars/clubs, and I was definitely dealing with my own issues of depression and low self worth, which did affect our friendship. But we always recovered and things usually would go back to normal after a month or two of my moodiness. 
 Now I've completely unexpectedly (as I also didn't want to start anything when I'm likely moving away very soon) found a man who I love and can see a future with (We started dating in August), and suddenly her attitude towards me changed completely. 
 It probably started when we went out to a club in early October, but rather than going back to my flat to sleep, I went back to my SO's (which in my mind was no different - it's not like she would be staying with me, I just walked home instead of getting the bus). Since that night she has said I've chosen him over her, and that I've ""changed"". She says I'm always busy, too busy to hang out and ""we never go out like we used to any more"". 
 I've tried inviting her out with my boyfriend, but she doesn't want to be the third wheel (completely valid IMO), and now it has been obvious that she truly hates my boyfriend (obviously because he's taken me away). I've tried inviting her out with just myself, but she seems to always find excuses to not come, or acts really reluctant and seems grumpy to just be around me. Granted, I no longer enjoy going to clubs and dancing with men, but I'm happy to go and watch if that's what she wants! But she never seems to offer to do anything... Its always been me that arranged nights out throughout our whole friendship. 
 
 Three weeks ago, with the latest bout of her saying ""You are always busy, so I'm doing other things"" despite me inviting her out/over to my flat to do things multiple times that week (none of which with my SO), I was very upset and angry, and I mentioned the times I've arranged things, and how she has  never  arranged any outings with me. We haven't talked since. 
 I don't know if I've done something wrong, or if she's jealous (as a mutually friend thinks... but I think it's more! It has to be more than simple jealously!) but more importantly I don't know how to fix this!! I want this to be back to how it was, but I worry this friendship is unfixable.","Friend of 3 years has been in and out of relationships while I've always been single.

"First off, I live and go to University in England, and I'm in my final year. 
 I only really entered the dating ""game"" seriously about a year ago, and while I have no trouble approaching, talking to, and usually flirting with women, I don't seem to meet very many who are single, or single and looking for anything! 
 I mean, obviously I meet a few, but so far there's only been a couple who I was interested in. One of whom has become a decently good friend anyway. 
 I'm fairly sure I don't have ""high standards"" as I find an awful lot of girls attractive both physically and from their personalities... it's just I don't meet the ones who are available! 
 I meet very few girls through my social circles, and they're usually girlfriends of friends, who don't particularly hang out with THEIR friends together with the rest of us. A lot of my friends are also reluctant to go out a lot of the time, and I've been the one who's put the whole social circle together in most cases. I feel like meeting new people would help with this... but that's hard as a final year for some reason, and I'm already a member of a few clubs and know those people there. 
 I'm totally fine with the fact that they don't want to go out drinking or whatever, but it leaves me without people to even go and hang at a bar with, which seems to be the best way to meet people at the moment. A couple of times I've decided to try it by myself, which has been mostly fun, but it's not really a great time without friends, feels odd. 
 I also feel like I have missed out/am missing out on the massive world of people hooking up at university, which bugs me, but my lack of going to clubs is entirely my own fault, and I'm not sure I'd feel comfortable going alone anyway.","No friends to wingman me/generally hang out with at bars - how do I meet more girls?

"I did 4 years as a scholarship NROTC midshipman and commissioned a couple of years ago. 
 You seem set on going to college and earning a degree, and that's great. I may be biased as an officer who was never enlisted, but if you will earn a college degree don't enlist.  It is very difficult to commission in the Navy after enlisting.  I know several Sailors who have earned their Bachelors and one who earned his Masters before they enlisted, and they all regret that they didn't know about OCS. 
 Yes, some schools are part of a consortium so you will be part of an NROTC unit at another nearby university BUT do not assume that you can do that from your university of choice.  You mentioned that there is a military academy nearby, you need to contact them to see if there is a way for you to participate in NROTC.  This is unlikely, so you may have to look at other universities with a NROTC program. 
 You can not be active duty while in NROTC.  There are ways to be selected for college programs on active duty after enlisting (STA-21) but don't take the chance on that if you can go to college instead of enlisting. 
 As far as balancing schoolwork and having fun with the military requirements: NROTC lets you have a normal college experience.  Seriously, the military requirements are minimal: one morning of drill, one Navy class per semester, PT 3 times a week, some required courses (calculus, physics, etc. which are often part of your GEs anyways) and a month of summer training every year (which is A LOT OF FUN because the Navy will spend millions to convince you to finish and commission).  Academics are always the most important thing, because you're useless if you don't graduate.  The NROTC program will do everything possible to ensure you succeed.  Our military professor (a Marine Corps Colonel) would talk to the professors if a student had problems, and the program would pay for private tutors if you needed extra help in a class.  Many of my NROTC classmates were members of fraternities/sororities, the school band, clubs, and even varsity sports (NCAA Div 1).  I was in a bunch of clubs, the school newspaper, and I had a part time job.  As far as partying, like I said I had classmates in the Greek system so having a good time and enjoying college was definitely a central experience.  Just don't do anything really stupid, or publicly stupid until you're 21.  There is a zero tolerance policy for drug use, just like the rest of the military.

"Hello all. First, need to get this off my chest: I'm a new guy here (subbed two months) but already I can see what a lot of veterans are saying about some of us new subs. Please don't post without reading the sidebar material, and without thinking very clearly about the message you want to convey. For that matter, don't post without having practical experience to talk about. I didn't understand the complaints about the ""signal-to-noise"" ratio when I first started. Now, I see how the random ramblings of some folks here are degrading this valuable resource. I shouldn't have to wade through aimless questions and stealth-bragging to get to the meat of TRP. 
 So since the original post, which I'll link when I'm at a desktop, here's a rundown. 
 -The five days of ""punishment"" ended, we had sex that night, and it was pretty good. One thing I was always alpha about in my beta days was never accepting a starfish from her, so when we go at it, it's great. So from her, no initial resentment. Three more times before Aunt Flo shows up. 
 -She has cooked for me about twice every three days since the end of the ""punishment"". This is up from once every couple weeks. Breakfast in bed three times. 
 -We had a decent sized blowup last weekend, as I expected. (Example of why you should read the damn sidebar. What do you think, I'm some kind of psychic? Seriously, read up!) I invited her on a shopping trip, and again, as expected, she needed to amend the agenda. She asks to go fetch her mother some supplies, and I agree. Later, she complains about being hungry, I wasn't really, but we go to Smashburger anyway. I wanted some too and wanted to get her a decent but fast meal, so we can get on with what I invited her for, the grocery shopping, and I also wanted to hit two other stores. We're standing in an empty line, and I choose my food, then she chooses. I wait, because of course, she might change her mind, which she does. Now, I'm used to ordering for us when we're eating out, so after her second choice, I start moving towards the register and grab the menu, at which she scolds, "" Stop rushing me!"" I iced her out for a few minutes, then I calmly asked, in a way that accepts my own responsibility, (an unfortunate reality of LTR) ""What was it about my actions that made it seem like I was being impatient?"" She responded that it felt like I rushed her. I asked how. Of course, it was only because ""she felt rushed"". Always press for an example of your alleged bad behavior. You'll be surprised how often she will say something that doesn't connect to reality, or be able to say nothing at all. She packs up her food which she swore she wanted and didn't touch. As we left she says my problem is everything has to be my way. My response, ""Any other complaints?"" (Maintain frame guys) And so we go to the grocery. I had wanted to hit two other stores in that plaza, but at this point, I just wanted to be done with this woman for the day. 
 Despite my anger, I made two attempts to pull her in for a hug, give her the reassurance that we're cool. (See, even though I ""messed up"", I'm the one who gets to reestablish contact) She refuses in the store, saying, ""Nothing I do is good enough for you."" I give her a bigger freeze this time, she cries on the way home, which I didn't know until later. After I tell her to stop playing the victim due to her complaining about ""how I was treating her"", the tears started. TRP really is working for me. I genuinely didn't know she was crying and she was right next to me. In the past, I would've been so far up her emotional ass, there would be no way I wouldn't have known that. 
 We get home, put away groceries, and she runs to her room. I go chill, she finds me, and we hash it out. She eventually realized several things.
1) She needs to be able to give me examples of things that she says she has issues with. She has to be rational for me, I let emotions in for her. She's starting to get it.
2) She can be irrational (DUH!) The only way I know she realized this is later that night, she admitted it in her own words.
3) She needs to remember that I have her best interests at heart, and she needs to show patience with herself and the way she processes emotions before she can be a good wife to me, and a good mother one day. If she wants a baby, I've made it clear that she has to get this shit together. 
 It's been good all this last week, as much hot food and sex as I can handle, some decent conversation mixed in. Every time I have maintained frame, it's come out positively. A message for my LTR brethren: gain outcome independence. She needs to know that no commitment is unconditionally given by you, ever. That's married or shacking up or whatever. If you're married and she refuses to acquiesce, you've got a tough choice to make, but in the end it's better than wasting years of your life. The single guys know this well, but we LTR guys get oneitis the absolute worst, obviously. Go out and flirt, and remind yourself why your wife needs to act right. If you don't feel comfortable doing that, then suck it up. Your SMV needs to remain high regardless of your relationship status. Last thing, remember: you're the star, she is here for you, not vice versa.

"Hi, I've posted here a few times but for those who don't recognize me I'm in the army and have just finished my deployment to Afghanistan. I didn't have it as rough over there as most people however I did hit a sort of low point were I lost my testimony and haven't really recovered. I've had my problems with the church before but I brushed it off and carried on. I was lucky enough to attend a few lds services while deployed though. 
 I've been back for a little over a month now and I really didn't want to be back in church culture. You can say I had an inactive period before deployment. I'm a 20 year old single guy who didn't serve a mission, I feel ""outcasted"" for not serving even though I did my time overseas. Since being back a don't feel called to do a full time mission its just not what I want to do. Anyways, I've been feeling a bit depressed more then usual lately. Being alone with no family or even a girlfriend where I'm at has been a downer. So I felt compelled to go to Church. I looked up the meeting house and decided to jump. 
 The ward is pretty much a military congregation with a few retirees and civilians. I got there a little early and sat alone for a while before the ward clerk noticed me and introduced himself. I then met the Bishop, his wife and mother-in-law(Who I ended up sitting with). I sat through the primary program which reminded me on why I loved the church (Kids are cool), gospel principals was ok. Elders Quorum wasn't as good partly because I have social anxiety and I'm new. Then it was over. 
 I'm feeling pretty good right now, I may go again next week. Its been a long time since I've been a bigger active ward and it was easier to integrate then I thought. I do believe that the church is true but I still have these doubts and church culture bothers me somewhat. This is pointless but I felt like i wanted to share!",I went to Church.,20,M,latterdaysaints
"I have no experience with guys. And I've recently been hanging out with a guy that I like. Me (22f) and him (23m).

"My boyfriend and I are both Juniors in college. 
 He's been experiencing hair loss since he was 18. Since we've started dating, this issue has come up in bits in pieces to where I'm away of the problem, and how insecure it makes him feel. I try to reassure him, and generally just never bring it up. If he mentions it, I tell him I love him whether he has hair or not, how attractive i find him, etc etc. Up until now, it's usually worked out fine; he realizes he shouldn't stress, and we go on to what we were doing. 
 Well, recently we had brought up the issue of graduation and I mentioned some new grad schools i was considering. He got upset, but this somehow eventually led to him breaking down and bringing up that he had lost more hair in the shower that morning. We talked, and he admitted it's a big self-esteem thing for him, which of course makes sense. We discussed him seeing a dermatologist, but he's researched before, and I now have too, and it seems all he can do is just accept it, since the medication has sexual side effects, which is not something he (or I for that matter) can accept. 
 So, he'll make an appointment with a dermatologist once spring break is over, but I'm starting to get worried about how to help him. I really have no idea what to do or say. I try and reassure him, but it seems like such a personal problem that, no matter how much I say he looks great, the fact that he's only 21 and losing his hair is tough.  He has no bald spots, but it's thinning, and that enough is bad. 
 What can I do? Should I just not bring up this and make it a taboo topic? Should I talk to him more about it? Or just do as I am now and accept that that's all I can do? Thank you. I've never seen him that upset before, and it's really made me start worrying.",Boyfriend is losing his hair. Huge hit to his self-esteem and has taken over his thoughts.

"I'm a 23 y/o female. I had very close friends in school just like probably most people. But as soon as I got into the working world it all fell apart. My social circle revolves around me and my SO. I feel pretty frustrated about it. I mean I want to have those girl talks and get advice or hang out. 
 My main problem with it probably is that I have way too high expectations. I'm trying to find a person that will be there when I call or text me for anything, or at least see me the same way that I see them, but so far everyone I've been in contact with already has this person of their own. And they usually don't seem like they want to stay in contact with me. 
 I have this one particular situation right now where the girl rather lies to me than say it to my face that she prefers to spend time with her other friends. Or that she doesn't want to hang out with me as often, even though we connected right away and had a lot of fun. 
 A little detail on me: I'm more introverted and I have a case of insecurity, but I honestly try my best. For anyone who knows about the MBTI, I'm an INFP if that helps.

 [progress pics]( 
 I started last July at 224lbs and I really didn't realize how out of shape and overweight I was at the time. The first picture is at my college graduation June of last year. I started C25k in August  and ran my first 5k mid October last year with a time of 34:54. The second picture is when I got home from that-- I was sooo jazzed. I got just under my goal of 35 minutes. 
 I've been continuing to run and watch what I eat and drink since. I've had ups and downs but now I'm down to 180/181. My original goal weight was 170, but now I'm striving for 160  and a healthy bmi at my height :) 
 I started the zen labs 10k trainer- picking up where the 5k left off a few weeks ago and will be doing my first 10k on June 1. I've noticed the more I exercise the more my body craves good healthy foods. If I skip a run or don't exercise for 2 days I'm more likely to eat junk and crave it. It's a vicious cycle I'm constantly battling. 
 I just ran a second 5k race yesterday and beat my time! I got around 33:20 something, I didn't quite see the clock and official times haven't been posted :(. I wanted to get under 30, but I'm happy that I improved AND beat my boyfriend! 
 Last picture was taken after the race yesterday. Different bathroom, new phone, similar bib number, 20 lbs lighter and the same clothes. My weight loss has never been so transparent to me. I really wish I had taken more regular photos of my weight loss. I just never thought I'd be on this end of things. 
 I love this community, and I love coming and reading everyone's posts on a regular basis. It's been a tremendous amount of support over the last 10 months. I thought I'd finally share my story with all of you.","Lost 40 lbs, improved 5k time and training for a 10k. I love you all!!!!!",23,F,loseit
"I (28M) am currently in a 2.5 Yr long distance relationship with my girlfriend (25F). We started dating in our last year of graduate school and both graduated with the same degree in the same class. We both have jobs and make about $118,000 each. After we graduated I moved back to where I was from (I'm from the Midwest and she lives in the east coast). Ever since then we've had a long distance relationship and it has been long distance for about 21 months now. Before I moved we were dating for about 7 months so in total we've been together for about 2.5 yrs. We see each other every monh or two. 
 My GF is has really a great girlfriend. She hasn't cheated (that I know of). Helps me with anything. She pays often when we go out. And she is REALLY devoted to me. I know she would be extremely happy if I proposed to her which she's waiting for me to do... and she has said she' ll wait however long it takes. 
 Here's some other background info before I continue: I cheated on her about two months into the relationship and she found out a few months after it happened by a friend of mine. We worked it out and it feels like a non-issue now --- my parents weren't accepting of her when they first found out about her.  However we fought through that and they seem ok now. Now it seems like my mom has still has doubts about her ( I think because we're not the same ethnicity) --- both of our parents have met and they got along fine ---- I went on a trip to the Caribbean with her and her family in January --- I'm not sure if any of this stuff means anything but I thought I'd put it out there. 
 Throughout our relationship I've always had mixed feelings about her and I. First and foremost (this is going to sound very shallow) I'm not satisfied with how her face looks sometimes. Mainly because her nose is kinda big and crooked. It bothers me. I don't even like posting certain pics of us online because I get embarrassed of bad angles.  I'm sure it's probably my insecurity about what other people will think but I can't get over it. It also bothers me that my mom isn't completely accepting of her. However I do think she's sexy and cute in her own way. 
 Also, this is actually my first relationship that's lasted over 6 months and now that I'm out of college and making good money I feel like I want to travel without her and have fun at strip clubs and seeing what else and who else is out there. I kind of miss being single. I feel like if I stay with her and get married I'm still going to have these thoughts in my head. Maybe I won't, but its not something I want to be thinking about while I'm married. 
 However there are other days when I feel like I have such a great girlfriend and I'd be a fool to let her go. She's been soooo good to me. And the sex is decent when we can actually do it. She does have a nice body. 
 If I break up with her, I'm scared about her reaction. I think this is what has prevented me from doing it sooner. I tried breaking up with her before I moved back home bc my parents didn't accept her and she literally got on her knees, cried and begged me to stick with it and make everything ok.  And since we are long distance I HAVE TO DO IT OVER THE PHONE! And I don't know how that's going to turn out. I don't want her flying here to make things good between us.",Great girlfriend loves me very much and I love her too but I feel like I'm not completely happy about relationship due to her looks and my desire to have sex with other women.

"I need advice, and as I am severely depressive bi-polar I thought this might be a good place to get it. 
 I'm going to be 22 years old in December, and of these 22 years I've been officially diagnosed with some shape or form of depression for 12 of them. I've always known the reason, or at least a very large portion of it: I'm a type 1 diabetic. I was diagnosed at 9 years old. My life has been a torrent of self-loathing because of it: self-harming, suicide plans/attempts, and only taking care of my diabetes to the point of staying alive. My life has had it's challenges beyond the beetus, just as everyone's does. Divorced parents, severe anxiety disorder, an inability to fit into any certain spot in the grand scheme of life. Mom and Dad did their best, but I was bitter and self-destructive for so many years. They couldn't handle me, or each other. Thus, their schism. I didn't go to (traditional)High school on account of being too sick, was agoraphobic for ages 15-17, and as I type this I'm sitting in the same room I spent so much time hating. It's as if it bleeds from the walls, and seeps from the ground. 
 My home has been a labyrinth of distorted mirrors I constantly self-judged with. I hate this place, even though Pops says he loves me in between bouts of threatening to throw me out, and calling me an ingrate. I have great friends, whom I love and cherish above anything else. They love me too, and have proved it time and again. So, this is home. But... Mom ended up somewhere I could call home too if I wanted: Minnesota. 
 I love it there. I've spent a year in total there since she first started inviting me out 3 years ago. I got my first girlfriend there, the first job I enjoyed, I lost 45 lbs the first full summer I spent there, and most recently -after gaining all I lost back- 15 lbs in this past mid July/august I spent there. My diabetus is better there, I've never thought about offing myself, I've started making an entire new group of friends. They're no where near replacements for whom I have now, but it's a start. And of course, as in every cliched tale of fading adolescence, there's a blossoming love for me there too. I just don't know if I have the courage to pick up, and start a full life somewhere else. It'd be better for me, but there's so much I love here. I even love my moody. flimflam father. Whom is composed of about ~65% selfish asshole. 
 I've been such a fuck up in my life, that I don't have the confidence in myself to see this potential new chapter succeeding. I'm a grown-ass man, yet in the glimpses of passing windows I still see the scared, meek 16 year old I was. I could drop out of school(which starts tomorrow), sell my truck in realistically a couple of weeks if not less and be gone. 
 I don't quite know what it is that I ask the few who read this. Maybe support, or sage advice, or someone to tell me that pursuing happiness against such dastardly odds isn't as crazy as it, or I, may seem. This doesn't even come close my full story. There's a tragic love story between the lines, and random adventures that define the man I am. Also, I do love myself now. Diabetes, depression, and no self-confidence included. They're all little pieces that form the fucked-up, beautiful mosaic that is me.","Should I throw caution to the wind, and try to start a new life?",22,M,depression
"Ok, so.. I don't know what I'm doing here. I don't know if I want advice or hugs or what the heck I'm doing. I'm a mess. I'm 19, female, a lesbian, and I am so close to losing it. 
 It revolves around my girlfriend. She's 16, I'm 19. We're in a long distance relationship. And I'm her first female relationship. We met about a year ago, getting together in January, breaking in March, getting back together in June (the break was because she was scared about being in a same sex relationship. I offered her an out because I could tell something was making her unhappy and she took it). 
 Even people who are supportive of me being lesbian don't really approve of our relationship. If it's not for it being long distance, it's the age difference. But I love her. I can't help that. I tried when I first realised and I just can't. She loves me. After all we've been through, even with my fear of abandonment and depression, there is no way I can doubt that. She has helped me through so much and every time something has gone wrong and I've needed her she's been there for me. 
 Which brings us to where I am at the moment. Her mother found out about us. She read our chat while my girlfriend was at school. She called me a sexual predator. She took away all forms of communication. On top of that, she is punishing her. Her room has been stripped. She was talking to me using her old ipod until she was found with that and it was taken away too. The last time I spoke to her she was dealing with it about as well as I am.. She's blaming herself, as she has a tendency to do, and nothing I could say could fix that for her. 
 I feel so useless. I have no way to contact her to tell her it'll be okay. I know no one there is listening to her. I know she's hurting and even more so at the unfair punishment (I do understand that they probably aren't seeing confiscating the laptop, phone and ipod as punishment so much as what they would consider protecting her, but it doesn't make it fair). I feel like I'm failing her. All I can do is curl up on the couch cuddling the teddy she sent me, wearing her shirt, and cry while waiting for her to contact me. I want to help her. Her scent has faded from everything she sent me now and I was using that as a link to her. I don't know what I'm doing anymore. I miss her so horribly and terribly, and I know she's going through a terrible time and I can't help her. We were going to do this together with me there to support her. 
 I just feel so useless and like a failure.","my girlfriend's mother just found out. We have no way to contact each other and I'm a whiney kid.

"Well, to start things off I was diagnosed with severe OCD at the age of 12 and throughout my entire early life was raised under good old fire and brimstone Roman catholic. Throw in OCD into the mix and you have a young boy going through the turmoils of believing he was going to hell every waking moment of his life just because he didn't do this or that (traditional OCD ritualistic practices that ranged from touching a faucet handle to running up and down the stairs an even number of times). It was until 5 years later after going through all this that I realized that this religion had such a crippling and taxing hold on me that I knew that this wasn't the way. No church should ever have to make it's believers live in such a state of fear for absolution and with that epiphany I dropped it pretty much all together and freed my mind of the chains of my affliction. Now I did realize it was my OCD the entire time but when I took the power away from the religion, the OCD became nothing but repetitive rantings that now I can simply ignore. Does this mean I don't believe in god? No, I still believe there may be something out there, but I also believe one doesn't have to suffer as I did for ""salvation"". To this day I worry for my future children who could bear the same mental ailment and pain that I went through growing up and Ive considered other possibilities to spare them of it such as not pushing religion on them or just simply adopting. Religious OCD, just like all OCDs, is terrible and debilitating, but its after you realize it all isn't real and can't hurt me that you can slowly take the steps of healing to better place and state of mind.","OCD and Religion sucked when mixed, dropped it to free myself",17,M,AskReddit

"When I was 18 i got my girlfriend pregnant. I had just gone trough a rough time having just been arrested 2 times within 6 months for trees. My mom and I hadn't talked since my first arrest. We also were on rough terms for the last 4 years before that, do to her marrying an asshole of a stepdad. He had also ousted the rest of her side of the family from her life for him.  So things were already pretty shitty. 
 So after about 5 months of asking myself fow i would talk to my mother, I grew some balls and called the woman I hadn't talked to in almost a year. It was short and just said we should meet for lunch by her office. I was thinking somewhere public as to avoid any major scenes. 
 I arrive at her office and we hug and have a brief ""hey how are you, missed you"" type of conversation. She suggests this new sushi place down the road, she drives us. 
 Fast forward to the restaurant. We arrive and the place is dead. I mean fucking dead not a person in the place. This is when I had a major mental freak out, I didn't know how I could do it. Tell my mother than I'm about to have a child... In 4 months. After everything that has happened between us I just keep imagining the worst if I tell her. After we order our food we get quiet and she looks at me and asks me what's really going on, and before she even lets me answer she says. You got your girlfriend pregnant didn't you? I nodded yes and she exploded into tears. While all of the employees watched. The scene was happening. She cried for what seemed like forever as I told her everything about how far along she was. It was a boy, and he was healthy. 
 Once she had calmed down she had to get back to work and I paid the tab. we walked out of my most embarrassing restaurant experience, into the parking lot. As we step off the curb my moms heel snaps, and down she goes. More tears. I helped her up and limp her over to the. I had never seen my mother in a more pathetic helpless state. We got back to her office and she hugged me and said she would call me soon to talk more. 
 A few days later I got a call and we able to really talk. It was very nice and good for both of us. She had actually become extremely excited about the baby. We started talking more and more. My mom became very supportive of us. She began to talk to the rest of her family, we she had shunned around the same time as me.

"Story time indeed. 
The year was... 2013 actually... it happened in april. So I was waiting for my P.E teacher to arrive and was hanging out by the football field with a bunch of friends. The football field had a concrete floor and was about 10 feet lower than the platform me and my friends were standing on, and there was a barrier which was about waist high separating football field from where I was. 
 Relevant information: I was quite athletic back then, and was pretty good at jumping over stuff and climbing stuff. I mean abnormally good (not to brag or anything :P). 
 Anyway, one of my friends says ""Hey, think you can jump over that barrier there?"" I had jumped it many times in many different ways, but there was one way which I was always kind of afraid/knew I couldn't clear, which was to go with no running start, just hop over it. So, my brain had one of those truly full retard moments and was like ""Hey, now's your chance to try that impossible shit you've always known you can't do...""
And so I did. And the thing is, I ALMOST cleared that, but the tip of my left foot hit the barrier, I lost my balance and crashed hard on the ground below, elbows first. At first I didn't really realize what had happened then I looked at my left elbow (which was completely and utterly disfigured) and I just thought ""Well shit..."" It didn't even hurt that bad, believe it or not. Everyone around me were flipping their shit, I heard a girl go like ""OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG"" and all I could think was ""Wtf, just call an ambulance and get me to the hospital."", and I was pretty chill. At the hospital, the doctor couldn't even tell by the X-ray that it was an elbow he was looking at. I went into surgery right away and, well... Today I'm wearing a cast cause I went to remove some bolts n'shit last monday.

"And she just broke my heart, again. I feel like a stupid fucking idiot because I fell for her after all of the shit she put me through last time. 
 THIS IS A LONG READ 
 We met last year in High School. And she was just, beautiful. She had an awesome personality, amazing eyes and a rocking body. We fell for each other about a week after we met but she broke it off because she felt like she didn't know me well enough. So I tried to make plans but she kept backing out or ""had other plans"" and then we stopped talking for a while. We started talking again about a month later and she had a boyfriend. He was my well, I wouldn't say friend, but he's a good guy, at least, I thought he was. I hung out with them at a local bowling alley (during the NFL playoffs so there was free chicken wings and pizza) and he was a huge asshole to her. I tried telling her that she deserved better and she freaked out on me telling me that I didn't know what I was talking about. They broke up two weeks before Valentine's day because he cheated on her. She was devastated. So I was there to help her with it and then come Valentine's Day we fell for each other again. Then (while I was shopping for her gift) I get a text message, it's from her Ex's friend, basically, he was saying that I'm creepy because I want to buy her a gift for Valentine's day even though we aren't a couple yet. I shrugged it off, but her a nice necklace. (was worth an entire winter's worth of snow blowing and shoveling driveways) I call and tell her that I bought her a gift and got reservations to go out to dinner that weekend. (everything was booked for V-Day) She didn't answer so I left a message. The next day she calls me back, tells me she has plans to go to the mall with her friend Kayla so I had to switch the reservations. (which is very confusing and time consuming for a 15 year old) So Saturday rolls around and my cousin and I had to go to the store and pick up food for a party we're throwing the next weekend. In the store who do we see? Kayla. We're both thrown off. I go up to her, ask her why she isn't at the mall with Meghan. She said Meghan wasn't going to the mall today, she went out to dinner with her friend. Another guy. That wasn't me. I confronted her about it, telling her that it's fucked up how she knew she was going to be with another guy and didn't bother telling me about it. She told me she wanted to take a break (fuck me right?) so whatever, I shrugged that off...again. Eventually we grew really really distant and I fell for my friend Leah. We were perfect for each other...but sadly she only wanted me for the intimacy, not the companionship, which was fun while it lasted believe me but, fuck, that wasn't what I wanted in a relationship. That fling lasted up until April, and I told her I just wanted to be friends, which was good for both of us, so I was happy. Remember Meghan? Oh yeah, she confessed her feelings for me over Spring Break, then two days later tells me she's going to date another guy. I get pissed at her for leading me on and she goes through an emotional breakdown and her friends freak out on me for making her upset. (fuck me right?) So I stop talking to her, prom rolls around and the girl I was supposed to go with gets suspended from the prom for too many referrals (NYS educational system at it's finest) so I was out of a date. Guess who texts me a week before prom? Meghan. Telling me how this guy (Brandon) she was hanging out with tried raping her and how he forced his (excuse the language) dick in her mouth and hit her and she ran away. He threatened her life if she told anyone. I guess she just trusted me at the time. So she asked me to go to prom with her, fuck it, so I said yes. The next night I texted her and asked her if she wanted to come back to my place after prom or go to her house or go to a party, she said she's going to Brandon's house...what the fuck? I'm still confused about that decision. So I asked her why and the convo ended with her saying she didn't want to listen to me bitch about her and Brandon so she threw away the prom ticket she bought me...bitch. We didn't start talking again until the first week in July, we talked all the time. She talked about this guy (Matt) and I listened, knowing that we were just going to be friends I didn't care THAT much. I told her that I just wanted to be friends for a while, SHE FREAKED SHIT. Telling me that I was just stringing her along for a ride and that I broke her heart (I didn't even make a move to have the chance to lead her on). So then we stopped talking again. Then, about a week after that, we started talking, she still had feelings for me and wanted to hang out at this local week-long festival in the town I live in. We were going to spend every day and night together and top it off by watching the fireworks (that are on the last day of the festival) together. Then, last Thursday, she tells me that she was in the car coming home from the bowling alley (with Matt) and was being followed by her ex boyfriend and his friend. She told me how Matt stayed with her until they left. Sunday, she tells me she's confused, about what? Who she wants to ""be with"" as far as a relationship goes. I freak out this time. Saying things like ""You're fucking kidding me? You're falling for this guy because he protected you while your ex-boyfriend stalked you? If I had a car or lived near you I would've done the same thing, probably even called the cops or kicked their asses...probably the former. She tells me that I don't care about her and I send her a ten page long message about how I've never left her side. She replies with ""Oh."" I ask her why she toys with my fucking head all the time, she replies with, ""Idk, it's just what I do."" 
 That was Sunday, at about 12:13 AM EST. 
 I hadn't talked to her since. 
 Got on facebook after a long day's work about two hours ago. 
 She's in a relationship with Matt. 
 I smoked a bowl when I saw that status, and I'm smoking a joint while I type this. I know drugs aren't the answer but I just feel so shitty Reddit. 
 Can you make me feel better? 
 Please? 
 Oh, and if I need to fix the formatting say so in the comments. 
 Thanks Reddit. <3

"Throwaway, I don't want this associated with my main account. I guess I'm x-posting because I'm looking for some advice. Is there  anything  I can do? 
 When I was 17, a senior in high school, I, like many others around me, thought this guy was kinda cute and cool. He was a magician, and he still is. I believe he is about 3 or 4 years older than me. I'm not sure how well-known he is, but he claims to do work with Criss Angel. 
(FYI, we never met up in person after we started talking this time) 
 Today, my coworker who is still in high school mentioned her ""Magician sub"" today. Immediately I asked her what his name was...and sure enough, it was him. I told her the story of what happened with him, I dunno, so she wouldn't admire him or anything I guess. 
 Basically, I had met him in person before, but when we started talking he was living at college. So it was all online or in text. I just looked through my old fb messages but I guess I deleted them because I was so disgusted by him. This was about 3 years ago. 
 At the time I was kinda into casual hookups and whatnot, so I had started talking to him. Something felt off but I kept talking to him because I thought he was cool. One time he wanted to call me on Skype, and when I did, he was jerking off. It was unwarranted at the time. 
 He harassed me for pictures of my butt. My butt is kinda big I guess. He harassed me and harassed me and I gave in for some reason, ashamed about that. He used it to blackmail me later. 
 He bragged about how he always had sex with girls at his magic shows, and he kept track of how many. He said he had slept with about 90 women, often unprotected. He wanted to travel the world so he could continue to do so. He said I wasn't good enough to be in a committed relationship with him so I guess that was good for stupid me. 
 I asked if he had any STDs and he said he had chlamydia but treated it. I don't know if he spread it around to other women. 
 One day, I said that I didn't want to continue or meet up unless we could start dating. Again, he said I wasn't good enough for him, because I wasn't experienced. He proceeded to insult me for not being friends with half the school. He went to a smaller school, nearby, and said if he had the opportunity that I did that he would go and befriend everyone. I said I had a hard time making friends because I am introverted and I had trouble with befriending people, because a lot of people bullied me. 
 He said that i simply didn't give them a chance (WTF) and that I was wasting my high school time by only having a select group of friends. Then I told him to fuck off and stop talking to me if he was going to insult my lifestyle.
The next day at school, some girls kept walking past me and saying ""Chlamydia."" Like, several times a day. I knew it was his fault. I confronted him in texts that night. He said that he wanted to give people a reason to talk to me, that it was my fault that I never gave them a chance. If they were good people they would ask me if I really had chlamydia (which I fucking didn't!) He had made a lot of friends in my school at that time so obviously they believed him over me (he told them I gave him chlamydia...) They threw waterballoons at me as I left the school a couple times. 
 I guess the one good thing that came from that is that it was about the point I stopped caring so much. I used to let it really get to me, so many people treating me like shit for whatever reasons. 
 But fucking....he doesn't need to be a teacher. I can't do anything though, I have no proof. I deleted those messages because I was disgusted and no longer wanted to see them. My coworker was glad I told her and she is going to warn her friends who think he is cool. She said every time he brought someone up for a magic trick he put his hand on their shoulder. I said he probably wants to fuck the teenage girls...like he wanted to fuck me. He's gotta be like 25 now. Ugh.",Mid-twenties magician creeps on high school girls,25,M,offmychest
"My father and hers grew up in the same small mining town where most houses are duplexes. My grandmother and hers shared a door step for 50 years. It was weird and nice that we ended up seeing each other. I started dating her the summer of 2011, which then turned in to a relationship when we both headed back to the city for university. As cliche as it sounds she became my best friend and all the time I spent with her was great. Unfortunately my room mates girlfriend was diagnosed with cancer which forced them to go home to recover, but we had the apartment essentially to ourselves for the remainder of the year and I eventually moved in to her place. 
 All is well until June 2013. She was going to spend a month in Africa as a part of her biology degree. She frequently took vacations with her family but we were never apart for more than 10 days. I obviously felt bad about her going away for that long, but I was so happy that she was going to have that life experience. The long month finally passed and I was glad to see her again. 
 Her mother and I greeted her when she got off the plane. Neither of us were big in to public displays of affection but we shared a small kiss and hug, got her bags and went home. When we went to bed that night she didn't say anything about missing me, only about how much she missed Africa. I felt terrible about that but I also felt pretty selfish that I felt that way. From there on nothing really felt the same. Neither of us would ever cheat on each other. It's happened to her twice before so she didn't want to do that to anyone and I'm not the type of guy that would cheat, so I didn't suspect anything. Eventually we broke up in August. I feel like it was the biggest mistake of my life. We had a trip planned for New York with her family and we both felt it would be best if I still went. 
 New York was incredible to a guy from rural Newfoundland. She's seen places like this before but I was blown away. We got along just as good as we always did. Kissed the same, held hands the same. Besides the nagging feeling of ""I know we're done when we go back"" it was otherwise the best time of my life. After the trip life was exactly the same as it was with her. We were just as affectionate, just as cuddly, all that stuff. All except we never said ""I love you"" to each other. 
 Here's where it really starts to hurt. I'm December I knew I had to start moving my stuff back home to my parents house. She and I agreed that I would be out by the end of that month, so I got to moving everything out. As soon as we were done exams it was like the last few nice months never happened. It hurt to see her move on so fast. We barely talked, it was hard to get her to see me and it went from feeling like we were back in a relationship to pure hell. It was so sudden and it's the first time in my life I've ever felt like I was heart broken. All the while she was having a great time over the Christmas break. 
 Here's the kicker. I've had a string of bad luck over the last few years. Courses I though I was doing great in turned to failing grades, I made it to the final stage of an incredibly long and gruelling hiring process for a job I didn't end up getting and all of my friends scattered across the country. I'm not blaming anyone for that. It's just the way it goes, but years of bad luck and things falling through can definitely take a toll on a man. She was my rock the entire time. I didn't care what happened as long as I had her. 
 My province is famous for workers draining to Alberta. I now live on the opposite side of the country, unsuccessful in a job search in a town where nobody has time to befriend each other since they work 12-14 hour days for 10 days on 2 off. All I've been thinking about since December is her and how I'd give anything to be back with her. Today is my birthday so she texted me, but immediately said ""I have to sleep"" when I tried to spark a conversation. I'm sorry for the wall of text but I've never been able to open up to anyone about this before. I don't know what to do guys ...","Girlfriend and I broke up but everything continued on the same until December when she dropped me like a bad habit.

"I was moderately depressed along with moderate social anxiety in High School. It took me a long time to realize that I was actually depressed. However after a bit though I started kinda poking around the internet realized I was depressed and then became afraid that people would think I was a freak or something if I told anyone so I became paranoid about not saying anything. I eventually got a boyfriend who was also depressed and that helped lighten my mood somewhat enough that I was brave enough to tell my parents in a letter (remember I was 16 at the time). They took me to several therapists who diagnosed me with depression. We shopped around for one that I liked (this is important!) and I stuck with her for about a year and a half till I could be on my own again without crippling sadness. 
 My therapist suggested I get a part-time job to get out of the house some outside of school and to be productive. It actually worked wonders! I was making my own money, I had some place to be outside of school, it helped me with the social anxiety because I could play the role of employee and not be really myself so I interacted with people much more and much better after a while. Slowly I got better with therapy and my part-time job and I made better relationships with my friends. 
 At various points in my life after that I have gotten depressed and sought help at my college's then graduate school's therapists on campus. In college after a bit of therapy (and gaining a part-time job! Again!) I got better. In graduate school I tried to stick it out more and get a part time job and tried really hard to do all the things both my previous therapists had suggested and it helped some but not a whole lot. I even started exercising...no happy feelings there. I was lonely and sad and in a weird transition period in my life as well as hating where I was living at the time. I went on a really mild dose of medication for about a year. It really helped! I wasn't instantly superbly happy or anything but the crippling sadness/worthlessness/stay in bed for literally hours on end doing nothing cuse I can't bother to get up cuse the world sucks feeling went away and I could function like a normal human being and get on with my life. 
 Once I graduated graduate school though my life was back on track and I became happier again and was able to come off the medication and that is where I am today a much happier person! Depression doesn't have to consume your life and you shouldn't let it! I am actually grateful for my periods of depression because they allowed me to reflect on myself as well as my situation and become a stronger person in the end.","was diagnosed with depression, therapy and part-time job helped enormously.",16,F,AskReddit
"My town was having a July 4th 5k and my mom signs up to run each year. She typically gets a group of her fellow Middle School teachers together and registers as a team for a discount. They were one short for the team this year, so guess who got signed up anyway? I've been back into running for the past 2 1/2 months or so, but didn't quite feel like I was going to be up to snuff for the race. 
 I looked up some stories on here and r/fitness about first experiences with 5ks to check out what I'd be aiming for. I was expecting about a 36 minute run, especially since I have a hard time pacing myself and figured I'd exhaust myself from competitiveness. I maintained a really fast pace through most of the race and only had to take a couple light breathers. When I saw the finish line timer, I noticed I was under 30 minutes in the last 100 yards, so I sprinted over the line and finished with a 29:40! I know, not that spectacular for a seasoned runner, but I'm fresh into this stuff after a long hiatus and I'm pretty damn proud. 
 After the race, I went and mingled and waited for my mom and brother to finish up. I saw one of my girlfriends friends I hadn't seen in a while. After chatting, I headed home and found out that I actually placed and got a medal in my age group at the race from a friend! 
 Also, the next day, my girlfriend was in a group text deal with friend I mentioned who said, ""coreyz232 is so thin!"" The last time I saw her I was probably around 235 and I think I weighed in at 213 pre-race.
So, if you are apprehensive about trying something because you feel unprepared or are nervous of failing, just know that I was there too. You might be surprised at the results. Best of luck and thanks for reading!

"She just sent me this text 
 Her: Hey so I talked to my friend. And like I said it takes a lot to make me mad, and so i'm not mad over something so trivial. But i'm also very honest and like to let people know how I feel. And that was extremely uncool that you approached her (her friend) and also mentioned I was mad at her? (it's true they're being bitches to eachother over stupid shit). You were out of line. She also told me she never said that  __  and I were still together, she just explained the situation like it is. (this is why I approached her, not the other way around - because the girl in question was ignoring my texts, I wanted a final answer so I went and got it.)
I don't know who's not telling the truth and it's not really even a big deal. I just don't know how all of this happened and it created a little too much drama in my extremely chill life. (LOL) So just like you were telling me, be careful what you say to people."" 
 Little bit of backstory, I asked her friend if she and her ex-bf still had a thing to which she said yes, & they still want to be together. That was a few days before I broke up with her (we've only been going out for 5-6 weeks). We broke up, it was mutual to varying degrees, and now she sends me this text. It seems like she wants validation and attention because really this whole situation is trivial and a waste of time really. If she didn't still want the alpha in me, why would she even bother? (her ex-bf was uber beta and they didn't have sex for the last 9 months of their relationship). I'm her first ""alpha"" apparently. She's 19 & a freshman in college, she's never had this experience before. I'm not perfect but i'm adopting as much TRP philosophy as I can. 
 I can ignore her text, but this might be a problem because i'm gonna see her tomorrow. Not intentionally but there's a huge party on campus and i'm gonna go party with my frat bros. The chances of her showing up are very high.
Or I can respond: ""Yes I agree."" (agree)
Or I can respond: ""Yes you're right, I am evil. Now you know my secret.. oooo (ghost emoji/halloween emoji)"" (agree & amplify) 
 I guess what i'm confused about is the text dynamic here. Agreeing and amplifying might work great face to face, but I feel like over text it has a chance of being misinterpreted. Corrections? Suggestions? Comments? Thanks for reading.","recently broken up with ex-gf is being a bitch over something really trivial. She is just seeking attention/validation. She says i'm out of line. Since it's over text, do I agree, or agree & amplify and risk having the loss in translation? I know A&A works great face to face, but idk over text.

"I'm sorry everyone!! I know there have been a lot of Comexim sizing posts but I just wanted some personal feedback. :) 
 I said I'd let myself order some Comexims after uni + exams were done for the year and the exchange rate is better - both requirements have been met, so here I am! Also it's my birthday soon so I want to treat myself. :P 
 Measurements: 
 
 snug: 26.5 
 btt: 24.25 
 standing: 38 
 leaning: 39 
 lying: 37 
 
 FOT-ish 2-3/5, narrow roots, splayed, close-set, very soft tissue, projected, inner fullness. My best fits cup-wise are Cleo Marcie 30G, EM PL Laguna 65GG and EM SM Summer Time 65GG (though these are all too wide for me). I prefer tight bands - a firm 28 is usually good. 
 For my first order, I'd like to purchase a plunge and a halfcup (1 or 2 seams, I'm not sure yet) with the only alteration being straps moved in on both - I've heard it's best to order unaltered bras first and go from there to see if any adjustments are needed later. 
 Concern 1 - Sizing:  After reading heaps of posts about Comexim sizing, I'm thinking 60J/K for plunges and 60K/L for half cups. But the problem is, I don't know which of the two sizes in both cuts to order first. I'm tossing up between either potential quadboob in the smaller sizes or ordering the larger sizes with cookie pockets if they end up too big - not sure if cookies would bring me up a full cupsize though. :P 
 Concern 2 - Cup coverage/height:  I love having cleavage and I would prefer less cup coverage. I'm afraid the larger size plunge may end up too tall. However I don't think I should get reduced cups because I've heard it makes the bras more closed on top which won't work so well for me. If I want less cup coverage, should I try the smaller sizes first or are my reduced cup thoughts incorrect? If there's no other option, I could live with more coverage though. 
 One last question, if my size is not listed in the dropdown box, I should email them to make my order right? I really want the Dafhne but don't plan on ordering it until I've got my size down, and the smallest band size listed is 65.",What size do I get???,20,F,ABraThatFits
"Throw away) I [M 19] have been dating my GF [F 18] for over a year now. When we started dating she told me she had a male friend that she met online. She was 16 and he was 23 when the met. She claimed that they were platonic friends who just talk sometimes. I didn't really thing much about it since he lives 150 miles away on the other side of the state. A little under a year ago she was texting him next to me while we were watching TV. I saw that she called him ""honey."" She said that it was just how people in her family talked, which is true, her grandma and aunt call me ""honey."" It still weird-ed me out a little. 
 I have only been in two other relationships before and was cheated on in both (High school, amiright?) anyways I guess I tend to be a little paranoid, but I've never told her that she can't hang out with or talk to other guys. She has a lot of guy friends, most of whom are really cool and it doesn't bug me. 
 Anyways, there's always been something a little off about the way she talks about this guy, like she has a crush on him. I't didn't really bug me until recently when she only started applying to colleges in the town where he lives (I graduated a year before her and am currently going to a community college in the small town where she goes to high school.) She says, ""It's just a coincidence, and that she forgot that he lives there."" However they've been texting each other every day since she started applying to colleges (I don't know what about, I refuse to go through her phone, I just see his messages pop up all the time."" 
 My friends all say that she's probably cheating on me, but to be fair they all hated her ever since we started dating and I spent a significantly smaller amount of time with them. (Quit smoking weed, no common interests with friends anymore.) 
 She says that she wants to stay together through college, and maybe get married some day. She genuinely sounds sincere, but I just have a hard time believing her for some reason, like my gut is telling me she's lying. Am I just being paranoid or is there something likely going on? Any advice is welcome at this point.","Girlfriend of over a year wants to move away to town where longtime ""platonic male friend"" lives for college. Claims coincidence. Feels fishy, need advice.

"I almost never remember my dreams. I am 29 and I can count the number of dreams I remember on both hands. 
 My hubby is very interested is planes of existence other than this material realm. Part of this study is alien and extra dimensional beings, so we listen to a lot of lectures on the subject. I was listening to one today as I laid down for a nap. 
 My family lived in a rural area in northern MI and my sister has never been comfortable with alien movies or discussions. She will ask people to turn them off or change the subject. 
 I have always wondered why I cannot remember my dreams. I try very hard to focus on the idea 'I will remember my dreams' when I remember to. I have had little success with my endeavor. 
 So today, as my alarm went off, I swear I heard a voice say, ""I think we should remove the structures"". I was alone in the house, but I thought it was my husband, so I asked, ""Which ones?"" No one answered me.

"So I'm in my first year at Cardiff University, which has so far consisted of my smoking habit increasing vastly, and my studying decreasing vastly. Anyway, the other night me and my friends decided that it would be a good day to go on a night out to the Student Union. Standard night out really, we all had a good laugh, and the night came to an end for most of us when the SU closed at around 3. My friends live in a different part of Cardiff to me, so I parted ways with them and started my walk home. Whilst walking my drunk mind decided it would be a good move to pick up, even though I'm absolutely skint. So I give my guy a call and manage to pick up en route to my house. I had about 15 minutes left of my journey home, so I figured I'd stop off somewhere and smoke up, given that it was about 3:30 by now and no one was around me. 
 So there I am about to spark my doob, when I hear someone shouting from inside a van ""Hey man, are you skinning up?!"". I decide to investigate as they sounded like they weren't about to mug me. As I walked up to the van I peer through the windows and I'm blinded by the fairy lights inside the van. Anyway, I chatted to the guys from outside the van for a little bit, just to weigh them up as characters, decide they seem like pretty safe guys, so I jump in with them. I climb in the back to find a mattress in the back, with fairy lights illuminating the interior and really chilled hip-hop playing in the background. These guys were doing it right. Anyway, it ended up with me and these 2 guys smoking a couple of joints together, and then we hear a knock on the window. We roll it down and smoke billows out like in Scary Movie and there are these 2 guys that are completely lost looking for a street that didn't even exist according to my phone, so we invited them in and carried on smoking up with them! 
 I know this isn't a fantastic story, but it meant a lot to me as it was the first time I'd ever truly united with some random people over a common love of green, and quite frankly it was one of the best nights of my life. I still don't know the names of any of the guys that I smoked up with, but if you are reading this by some miracle then I have to thank you for a fucking awesome time!

I had a noticeable increase in memory issues, forgetting words etc. as well as hyperactivity. Nothing severe, and I was definitely one of their least serious patients. While I was there, one of the doctors mentioned that they had noticed enough guys coming through the TBI clinic complaining of focus, attentiveness and related issues following their injury that it had gotten their attention. Anyway, I had like 3 months left in the Army and obviously I was not looking to do anything to extend that, so I did my best to get a clean bill of health and finish the separation process. About 6 months ago I started trying to attempt to go to school full-time, online, as well as work a full time internship, and apparently give my ADD/ADHD it's coming out party. The constant ""procrastination because you're overwhelmed by everything, overwhelmed by everything because you're procrastinating"" just snowballed and snowballed to the point where I'm on the verge of bombing two semesters in a row. My boss has 0 leadership skills, which means instead of a clear task and purpose (Which I can and have thrived with) I get vague instructions just further discouraging my getting any work done. My wife telling me that she couldn't deal with me getting so overwhelmed with everything finally motivated me to do some research, and consider that maybe this wasn't something that I could just motivate myself out of. I made an appointment with a doctor for an adhd screening, went in, filled out the questionnaire, and left with prescription for Vyvanse. Once I get the prescription amount dialed in, I plan on pursuing therapy as well.","My personal experiences, and those that I've heard of lead my to hypothesize that although Traumatic Brain Injuries do not cause ADD/ADHD, the injury or the stress that frequently accompanies the event (near death experience of a car accident, constant high stress load of functioning in combat) causes a failure in the individual's ability to manage the ADD/ADHD they always had had. I'm not a doctor, so I have no idea if this is physiologically making the ADD/ADHD worse, or if the injury and/or stress affects their cognitive or social skills enough that it dampens the individuals ability to manage the symptoms on their own, making it appear as though they recently developed ADHD.",25,M,ADHD
"I think D&D red box is the way to go as well. Some things in life you just jump into when you're ready. 
 My Auntie Lorraine got me the original D&D/AD&D stuff when I was like 3-4 years old, so this would be 77-78 for my birthday. I could read and write, but I wasn't able to do the game properly. I mentioned it to my parents and they mentioned it to her and she went out and got me the blue box and later the magenta and teal box of D&D. 
 Looking back, this would have been 1977...thanks, google and Wikipedia. 
 It took me a little while as I did it myself and forced my babysitters to play with me (I ran the game), but I did it. 
 There's a point to this story. Because no one knew what RPGs were (not even me) and I was literally a child, I had to make a lot of it up as I went along when I didn't understand something, or there were holes in the rules. God, were there holes in the rules. 
 I was about your son's age when I could actually run the game as intended. But the 2-3 years in-between I was inadvertently learning how to be a more creative DM to compensate for rule failures and my lack of understanding/being over my head. 
 Later I had come up with my own game (GI Joe) that I used to run for a lot of people who loved it. I don't think I'd have ever come up with my own system if I hadn't been challenged inadvertently like I was. But I had the interest to just dive in to the books and people around me with the patience to work it out. 
 ""Necessity is the mother of invention"" - the red box still comes with Keep on the Borderlands, no? I'd do that. Another thing is that it really ignited my interest in percentages, which lead to me being interested in statistics. I should mention I was also encouraged by my Catholic Montessori school, LOL! But they let me go as far in math and reading as I was willing to go and it gave me a lot of reason to push forward math-wise, probably ahead of where I'd have been. 
 The",of it is don't be afraid to give your kid a lot to chew on. Kids are still sponges until about 8. I'd go straight to the real thing and let him grow into it.,49,M,rpg

"A year and a half ago, I [22F] moved to a new city and moved in with my boyfriend. We have been together for 2 and a half years now. 
 I am finishing up school soon, and my parents want to make a trip to come visit me. It's at the point where I can't really avoid the issue anymore. 
 My parents are very conservative Christian. They think that having a boyfriend is wrong, and sex before marriage is sinful. They believe unmarried people of opposite genders should not spend time alone with each other. Just today I overheard my dad telling my mom about a girl that ""shacked up with her boyfriend"" with a very condescending tone. My dad is also possibly bipolar, and overreacts to literally everything. 
 Ever since I went to college, I started becoming less religious, and mostly consider myself an atheist at this point. I think they know I don't go to church, but we don't talk about it. 
 I have serious communication problems with my parents. I have never told them about any of my previous boyfriends, and they do not know that I'm in a relationship now. They obviously do not know that I am living with my boyfriend. 
 I could really use some advice on how to go about telling them, or how much to tell them. All the secrecy and lying is causing me so much stress, but when I think about how to tell them, I freak out. I always feel like a disappointment to them, not to mention they think living together before marriage is morally wrong.

"Its a tough, tough question. As a woman of 38, I don't have kids. Do I regret not having them in my life, right now? No, not at all. My life wouldn't be where it is if I had kids. I wouldn't have been able to quit my job last year and go back to school to get certified to do something I love instead of something I fell into in order to pay the bills. I wouldn't be able to take boxing as seriously as I do. I couldn't do the volunteer work I do and love. I couldn't have some of my hobbies. I couldn't take spontaneous weekend trips. I definitely wouldn't be with my boyfriend if I had had kids already. I have a niece and nephew I adore, and the kids of my friends refer to me as their aunt. I have a lot of love from children. 
 Will I regret not having them when I'm old and need someone to care for me? Hell no! Having kids is absolutely no guarantee that they will be loving and caring as you become old and infirm. Especially the more of a burden you become to care for. I think it would be far sadder to have someone that could take care of you and chooses not to, then to just have no children. My mom lives in a 55+ block, and since she's one of the younger residents and still in pretty good physical shape, she's become the one to drive people to their appointments, take their donated things to charity, keep them company. There is nothing sadder than watching a person wonder why their child isn't there to do this. 
 Also, what a terrible reason to have a child, and a terrible burden to put on them. ""Oh, I had you so I wouldn't die alone."" Full of love and caring, that thought. 
 Will I regret not having children later? I'm positive I won't regret having them before now. What I do regret is that I am my age. If I could be much younger so when and if my other half decides about kids, it wouldn't be hard or nearly impossible to have them, I would choose that. I don't regret not having kids with any of the people I've been with in the past. They aren't still here, and I've never wanted to raise children that way. 
 I would regret not having HIS children if he wanted them. 
 Although we've discussed it and adoption is always an excellent option if we come to decide we want children together and can't physically reproduce. There are so many kids that could use a loving home. Why add more numbers to the human population when there are already people on earth that need love. 
 Part of me is worried that I could be traded in for a model with a working reproductive system, but having kids for that reason would be a mistake as well.","Don't regret not having them so far, regret I might not be able to have them later if younger boyfriend wants them.

"I wrote this a month ago but couldn't post it - I'll do it now though. 
 My group of friends have all known each other for about 15 years, were all extremely close (most of us had lived together with each other at some point) and we were often told how rare it was that a group of friends would stay so close through school and for years into the future and how lucky we were. 
 In my life, 6 months ago, I had been seeing a girl for over a year (not part of the social group), we were living together and everything was going fairly smoothly.  I cared for her a lot and I thought I was in love (although I did have some nagging doubts that maybe she wasn't 'the one'). 
 The opportunity came up to travel overseas for a holiday with friends (a couple from within the close knit circle of friends) which I couldn't pass up even though my girlfriend couldn't come due to work commitments.  I went with the couple (2 of my oldest/closest friends) and the older sister(Jen) of the female half of the couple.  I had known Jen for quite a while, however had never really gotten to know her well during the years of my friendship with her sister. 
 Over the 10 days of the holiday, I got to know Jen and found out she was an awesome person that I really got along with.  We spent quite a few nights just sitting up and talking by ourselves about anything and everything (her sister and boyfriend are somewhat party-poopers and would go to bed fairly early). 
 Towards the end of the holiday, it had become obvious to me that I had met someone who 'clicked' with me on an intellectual and emotional level with a fantastic sense of humour - so much more so than my current girlfriend.  I'll just clarify now that nothing romantic/sexual/inappropriate happened at all on this trip (aside from perhaps some dancing at a club which I did feel a little bad about) between Jen and I.  No 'long lingering stares' or awkward 'almost kisses' or anything like that - Just the start of what could be an awesome friendship. 
 Sorry for the aside, but a little bit of background - My current girlfriend and I had gotten together after I had been single for about 6 years and I thought what I was feeling for her was really special and that I was in love.  What the trip had done for me, was to open my eyes about what connecting with someone should actually feel like.  I had no intention of pursuing anything romantic with Jen, but I knew that I would be lying to myself if I said that the 'connection' I had with my current girlfriend was the real thing.  After a week of being back from the holiday, I broke up with her (citing that the relationship wasn't working and that I thought we would both be better of if we split up) and she moved out. 
 Jen and I kept in touch over the weeks after we got back from the holiday and, after a month of us getting to know each other more and more, I asked her out to dinner.  We went out, one thing led to another, and we started dating regularly.  We weren't really telling everyone (including her sister & boyfriend and everyone in my close-knit group) about the dating as we were still figuring out what was going on between us and we were really enjoying the fact that it was just us. 
 After about 3 weeks of dating and it was obvious that there was some future in the relationship, we decided to tell people that we were seeing each other.  I would tell my close knit group, with the exception of her sister and boyfriend, whom she would tell.  Everyone that I told was really happy for us, telling me that we were a perfect fit for each other - some people even told me that they had talked about us getting together in the past as we were so alike. 
 Her sister and boyfriend on the other hand, were far from impressed.  When she went around to their house to tell them, she was called a slut (very out of character for the sister and boyfriend), was told that they couldn't believe we lied to them, and that they never wanted to see her again.  Now, if it sounds like I have missed part of the story, I haven't, that's how it feels to us too. 
 I tried to call, text, email, visit to figure out what the problem was - I was positive that there was just a simple misunderstanding between us for them to be acting this way.  I was treated the exact same, being told to fuck off, having to hear things like ""I never thought you would do this to me man!"" & ""I can't believe you would go behind my back and fuck my sister"" (coming from the boyfriend half of the couple - which was a bit weird). 
 Keep in mind that I had known, and been great friends with these 2 for more than 10 years.  I had lived with them, been on holidays with them, dropped into their parents house for coffee just to catch up, house-sat for their parents and pet-sat for everybody.  As far as I knew, we were like family. 
 In the last 5 months (Jen and I are now living together and I have literally never been happier or more in love in all of my life) we have received abusive messages from the couple on Facebook, been ignored at gatherings and they even refuse to turn up to events if we are there.  Not a single one of my friends can understand why they are acting like this.  I get along really well with Jen's parents (who I have known for years) and all of her friends, and they can't understand it either. 
 The real problem here however is the close knit group of friends has effectively been destroyed.  We can't all get together at regular events (Christmas parties, annual bbq's, birthdays etc.) without it being a major hassle about who is invited.  I am (almost) positive that my girlfriend and I are not at fault here but I can't help but wonder why my now ex-friends would feel the need to destroy so many long lasting friendships over this. 
 I also have trouble accepting the fact that my friends still want to hang out with the couple, even after the way my girlfriend and I have been treated.  I'd like to think that if I was in their shoes and another friend was unwarrantedly abusing and upsetting them, that I would be tempted to cut them off completely. 
 Not a day goes by that I don't feel a moment of regret and become upset at what has happened but I don't know how to move past it.  It feels like the easy-going, fantastic group of people that is my close-knit group of friends is slowly drifting further and further apart as more regular events are cancelled and everything we do has become a huge drama and there is nothing I can do to stop it. 
 And just so you know, while this sounds a bit like high school drama - everyone in this story is between the ages of 26 and 31.  Which makes it all even harder to understand. 
 It truly is breaking my heart to feel like this every day.",I am in love.  Happiest I have ever been.  Friendships destroyed for no reason.  Feels like I have a broken heart as well as being in love.  Destroying me.,26,M,AskReddit
"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. 
 First of all I would like to just say that I love my boyfriend! There was something about him that really attracted me to him. His calm and cool presence, his deep eyes, the way he naturally demands respect without uttering a single word. I could go on and on about him BUT recently I found out something about his past that I could never have imagined. 
 We met about a year and a half ago at an yearly summer festival. He was playing soccer and he kicked the ball by accident and hit me straight in the head lol, He came rushing towards me all concerned, and made sure I was alright. He stayed with me for 15 minutes! I was already crushing on him. I later found out in the fall semester we go to the same university! I saw him a few times at university and he always looked like he was in his own world, thinking deeply about something. I finally initiated contact with him and hot his number. He was friendly and agreed to hang out. We later started dating and things were awesome! He was caring and was just so different than any other guy I've known! 
 Fast forward : I was at his place waiting for him there. I came across a diary? I just was generally interested in what it was for. I thought of this as some university fancy notebook, but still opened out of curiosity. As I kept reading my heart sank! I quickly took pictures of all the written text so i could read it all at home. 
 Contents of Diary : So 2-2.5 years ago, my boyfriend was in love with another girl. Apparently he loved her for 6-7 years and it didn't work out for him. He's been depressed all this time. Every day, the version of himself he showed me wasn't the real him. He is depressed and couldn't come in term about losing this girl forever. 
 BUT  here's what the really concerning part about this is, he knew this girl from high school. But they weren't even friends or anything and he developed a crush on her. He fantasized about her every day without even knowing her! He created this mental image about her being the ""perfect girl"" for him, soul mates if you will (according to him) 
 He started university and was still obsessed with this girl. Stalked her on facebook and this obsession/limerence/extreme oneitis took over him, consumed him. He got depressed when he saw pictures of her with other guys! His university grades dropped, he never had any interest in studying. He just wanted this one girl he barely knew. 
 He got an internship at a different city and that’s the city where she went to university. He randomly saw her at campus and he froze apparently. He said this was like a dream. His destiny to see her what’s written in the stars.
 He stalked her facebook and found out about an event in campus. He summoned up the courage to go up to a girl he’s probably never talked to but fantasized about for year. He succeeded and got her number! Apparently she offered her number to him and he described her laughter as heart melting... He described this as one of the best moments in his life. 
 They texted and he kept writing about how he actually somehow made this fantasy about her a reality. Like he achieved the unachievable. He also wrote about how all those years of depression, he overcame that period and actually did something to be with her. He concluded by saying, if you want something so bad, the universe itself will help you achieve it. 
 Then one day at campus he saw her with some other guy and he felt bad. He texted her and she didn't respond. He was so depressed for that one month where she didn't respond. She finally did one month later and it reignited his hopes. He saw her at some event again with that dude and according to him his anger got the best of him and he wasn't acting right when he confronted her that day. He claims he let his emotions of hatred for the guy being with her get the better of him and the girl sensed that and she wasn't feeling comfortable that day because something was off about him. He even indirectly confronted the dude with her and that dude just walked away. The last conversation they had was the girl saying you’re bad , you’re evil. (This was a response to a joke he made about her chilling with her guy friend) 
 Afterwards, he texted her and she didn't reply. He later texted a genuine apology text and she also didn't reply to that. It broke him and he schemed things to see her at campus no matter what. He claims he couldn't let it end this way after all those years. He failed to see her and didn’t text her claiming his love for her.  His internship ended and he went back to his home city. It's been 2-3 years to those events and he can't move on from this obsession. Living in regret and self hatred for screwing this up. 
 The thing that really broke me was..
>it's been 2 years to that day. I fucked up. Why can't I get over this girl. I barely knew her, I found out so many flaws about her when I actually saw her but why? I loved her and was willing to sacrifice everything to be with her and the last words she uttered to me was that I’m evil and bad...Why do I only find happiness when I think about her? Fantasize about her? Why do I rely on my happiness on her? On others? Is it because of my abusive childhood that I never experienced love from my own that I desperately look to others to fill that void? I am now dating  OP , she's an awesome person but this is so unfair to her. I'm wasting her life pretending everything is alright. Pretending my past never existed. She deserved so much better than a low life scum bag like me.. I may not recover from this but there’s no way I’ll let  OP  suffer because of me… 
 I don't know what to do now. He's been obsessed with this girl and still thinks about her. I feel so broken that he will never feel that way about me. Should I confront him? Should I break things off? I just can't let go of him, I honestly do love him but why didn't he tell me about her. Why is he so obsessed about her? I can't believe that this is the same guy I knew all this time.... 
 Please help guys...",l; I found about my boyfriend's obsession with another girl by reading his diary. He's been obsessed with for 6-7 years and can't move on. He's depressed and pretended that everything is alright. I am broken after finding out and don't know what to do....,24,M,relationships
"I was 13 or 14, and was helping take some of my Troop's tents down after a Boy Scout Camporee. I was folding up a tarp, reached under it with my arm, folded it over, and revealed that I had stuck my whole arm in an anthill.

"I had just gotten out of a 2 year relationship during my junior year in college and was visiting a friend at another school. We pregame for a bit before  we start playing some stripping drinking games. Of course, being at my friend’s school and wanting to be cool, I’m the guy who’s hammering down during these games, telling everyone how much we drink at my school (I know, really bro). A group of girls rolls into my friend’s apartment and one of them is the cocky “I can outdrink all the guys” type. Of course I start talking trash to her about how I can outdrink her. This escalates and we get into a full blown argument that shifts into us telling each other how the other person’s school sucks. I black out while in my boxers, blasted, arguing with this girl in a room full of people. Next thing I know, I wake up on my back, in a room that I don’t know, with this same girl just riding me. Apparently, we just went from arguing to full blown making out and stumbled out of the party back to her place. Now, as I mentioned, I had just gotten out of a long relationship and I’m still hammered. So while I’m banging this girl, I realize, I don’t know her name. Next thing I know, I accidentally call her my ex’s name. She immediately stops, gives me a death stare, and tells me not to do it again and just keeps on going. I say it again. This time she doesn’t stop, but she gives me a final warning, saying she was done if I did it again. I say it again. This time she starts getting more into it and says, “Fine, I’ll just call you my ex’s name” and she began to call me Dave (not my name). So I’m just going to town on this girl and she’s just screaming some other dude’s name.

"I met him last semester, we had a class together. He's 22 and I'm 20, The first time we hung out was completely spontaneous- I was supposed to go get dinner with a friend, she cancelled, he asked if I wanted to get some food with him. We ended up hanging out for about 6 hours and really enjoying each other's company. We hung out again two days later and basically spent the entire day together. 
 Then winter break came and he left, I texted him a couple of times, got average responses, no big deal. When we got back to school, I sent him a text asking if he wanted to hang out, which we did, and he asked if we could see each other the next day. We have so much in common, and he keeps recommending things to me and vice-versa. 
 That's basically how it goes every time. He is rather shy, and a little bit awkward, and he's wonderful to talk to.

"I am posting this for two reasons. First, you, your SO, any female in your family and the men too,  need to know the symptoms of inflammatory breast cancer. It doesn't show up on mammograms or sonograms. It doesn't have a lump. All the things we're taught about breast cancer don't apply here. Also, your internal medicine, gynocologist or general practitioner has likely never heard of it, let alone know what it looks like. So you better know yourself. 
 Inflammatory breast cancer is a fairly rare breast cancer, about 2% of all breast cancer is IBC. As I said it doesn't have a lump. It is extremely aggressive and fast moving. Diagnosis alone, before staging has even occurred, is IIIB. 
 IBC doesn't show up on mammograms because it doesn't have a lump. Instead think of a tangled strand of yarn. That is more how IBC grows. Your breast may become swollen. In my case I had what seemed like a good-sized mosquito bite on the outside lower part of my left boob. Like a welt. I was a full C. In 11 days my boob had swollen so that I had a third, now D cup boob under my arm. Eleven days. Who the hell thinks cancer grows that fast? It's an infection. I mean my boob was reddened and kind of blotchy. I had a low-grade fever and swollen lymph nodes. We did a dozen fine needle aspirations, core biopsies, mammograms, sonograms and each time nothing. At first it came back positive for a staph infection, but no antibiotic worked. 
 Finally, after five months, I had an incisional biopsy. That's where they actually cut out a piece of the tumor. It was done under general anesthesia. And during surgery they did a frozen slide and gave it to the pathologist to look at. He had an oh shit moment and literally ran across the street to a major cancer center and asked them to look at it. My pathologist had never actually seen IBC except in a text book. The cancer center took one look and confirmed it was IBC. I was sewn back up and told. 
 The slow diagnosis allowed the cancer to spread. Over the next week we did staging. It had spread rather dramatically. It was in my brain, bone, lymph nodes, pleural cavity, spread from my left boob to my right and I had heavy skin mets. I was told 18 months at the outside. 
 And this brings me to point number two. I read the story about her friend Wendy. Stage IV does not mean you automatically die. It's not a picnic, but it doesn't mean you automatically die either. I was diagnosed over 14 years ago. The cancer showed up when I was 30, but I wasn't diagnosed until five months later when I was 31. I'm now 45. Stage IV isn't good, but it is no longer the death sentence it was. There are lots of us out here living our lives many years after a Stage IV diagnosis. 
 So the symptoms... 
 A sudden, sometimes overnight, swelling of the breast. This isn't a lump, but the breast or just a quadrant, may become swollen.
The skin of the breast is red or mottled
The skin is tight and itchy.
The nipple may become inverted.
Lymph nodes in the chest, under your arm or along the neck become swollen.
And these next two symptoms are of particular importance: 
 If you have any of these symptoms, try the antibiotics. If there is no dramatic difference after a single course of antibiotics, insist on an incisional biopsy. Also there is a very specific rash called peau d/orange. The skin on your breast looks like an orange with the ridges. If you ever have this, insist on the incisional biopsy ASAP. It is kind of the gold standard for Inflammatory BC diagnosis. 
 So while the world is bathed in pink this month, know that there is one type of breast cancer that really does need more awareness.","No, you need to read it.",45,F,TwoXChromosomes
"Last Friday, I had a friend come visit me while he was home from school for the weekend (he returned today). The reason for the title will be told in the story as follows. I don't know if anyone else has had this experience after smoking, but I don't know where to turn to on this. Let it be known I'm an avid smoker. Ever since it got me off my prescription antidepressants and sleep aids, I've been blazing every day.

 My friend comes over and we decide to spark up a bowl. I hadn't smoked with him before because he wanted to wait until college, so we were both excited to finally get stoned together. We sit in my backyard by the pool, chillin with my dogs, talking about college and how he is basically having sex all the time. But once we hit the bowl something happens, and shit starts hitting the fan. 
 He looks at me, eyes already slightly lowered, and tells me, ""Dude I'm having deja vu, like, I've already dreamt this before."" 
 In my experience, I have heard rumors that newer smokers, when high, can get the sense of deja vu more frequently or are more susceptible to it, I'm not sure, so I shrug it off thinking it's just the high, and I tell him this. But he says again, ""No like I've dreamt all of this before. The pool, dogs, all of it."" 
 I have had this happen before to me a couple of times too, like as if I am predicting the future, but never have thought much of it. 
 We return inside after smoking the entire bowl, incredibly stoned, and I instantly grab the big ass bag of candy and we head to munch in my room. But he catches a glimpse of my family's white board in the kitchen, and reads some markings. He then asks me about them, ""Hey this [specific amount of money]...This is how much your house is worth or something isn't it?"" And I respond positively, thinking anyone could derive that from a large fuckin number. But then he reads my last name out loud, and I correct him. He then says, ""It's happening again. Yeah I said your name wrong and you correct me, then you laugh (which when he said that I literally laugh) and you say that you're laughing because you think it's funny I put an extra letter in your name."" And I stop fucking dead in my tracks. 
 I shit you not folks, it's hard to describe in writing, but I'm trying my best. As he was speaking, I was literally about to say ""Sorry I'm laughing because it's funny you put an extra letter in my name."" 
 There were more incidents like this, but the one that freaked me the fuck out of my god damn pantaloons was this next one. 
 Later during the high, we are sitting and some tv show. He spots my speech I wrote for my brother a little over a week ago. He wasn't part of the wedding, and frankly I don't know if I told him about it or not (it's hard for me to remember at the moment, I'm high). He asks if he can read it and I say please do (for I rhymed it all the way through and marked it and stuff in order to time my rhymes right). He then says, ""Oh and these pencil markings are your notes for how you wanted to time it? Oh but wait they didn't matter because you messed up while reading it and just read through them anyway."" 
 My stomach dropped. My heart stopped. My mind was fucked. What I do know is that I never told him I had to write the speech, or what I was going to do with the speech (rhyme it), or that I even messed up my own timing during the speech and literally ignored my markings. 
 Has anyone had an experience like this? Was it the weed that enhanced some gift that he and I share? Was thee any gift at all? weed wasn't laced or anything. It's been boiling my noodle all fucking weekend and I just don't know what happened. Maybe a clairvoyant?  I don't know. 
 Keep smoking everyone. Maybe one day we will all smoke together in one monstrosity of a hot box.","Smoked with a friend who may have been clairvoyant? You be the judge. I'll just smoke.

"I agree with that assessment, for the most part. I also had a LOT of trouble gaining weight when I was younger, but one of the most significant reasons was definitely because I couldn't get enough food at home (don't ask why....) and I exercised so much that I was very muscular and SUPER lean at 6foot and 135lbs. 
 For one thing, I was ALWAYS cold. It seems that many people who are very thin suffer from this as well, and quite clearly there is a good reason to believe that this would play a very significant role in metabolism and an inability to gain weight. I am MUCH bigger now (180-185) and have a much better (higher) BF%, so consequently I am much more comfortable and warm (better thermoregulation/homeostasis of body temp). When I was skinny, my surface area was high while my mass was low. Couple that with little insulation and PRESTO, massive E loss all the time. Also I can remember being cold all night long while I tried to sleep, resulting in shit sleep most of the time (parents would keep house cold and were too cheap to buy enough blankets....). So I was pretty screwy that way too. 
 At one point I gained over 20lbs of muscle, but I was only eating just enough to gain muscle because I was worried about becoming fat. I got up to 163. However, I was ULTRA lean and once I stopped exercising and just tried to maintain, the muscle just melted away along with the weight (which was pretty typical). Well, again, I was cold all of the time and I just didn't put it together. I was eating a fair amount, but it wasn't enough to make up for the heat loss (I also live in a relatively cool place). I was back down to the low 150's in no time. 
 Then I did GOMAD for a couple of months and SS and packed on much more muscle and FAT, and now I can skip meals and skip working out for a week and I think to myself, omg I'm going to have lost so much weight... nope. Get on the scale and I'm still where I left off. That was unheard of before. Also, fat is very calorically dense, so missing a few meals might mean only losing 1-2 lbs.","We are made of mostly water. Water takes a shitload of energy to heat (specific heat of 4.184J/g'C) and if you are way skinny you have a ton of surface area with little insulation, little mass to hold heat, and little muscle to produce heat. Unless it's above 98.6'F ambient temp you are going to need to continuously make heat to maintain body temp, so if you are a skinny, low BF% dude (which is very commonly the people who complain about gaining weight) you are going to have problems gaining and maintaining weight. I now call it Scrawny Dude Syndrome (SDS).",20,M,Fitness
"Today I tried the [limited run aftershave]( from The Holy Black. Description from the website: ""This formulation is made from real American Whisky,the scent of musty paper, leather and a little pipe tobacco for good measure.A small amount of alum is also added to stop bleeding, and vegetable glycerin to soothe the skin. "" 
 So first off, I should say that this is the first splash I've ever tried--I've always used balms in the past. When I first opened the bottle I thought that only a little bit would come out when I pour it since it has what looks like a restrictor, but I tipped the bottle over only to have about a week's worth go right into the drain. I was a little mad, but it's totally my fault. Oh well. 
 The scent is really great. I don't know if musty paper is the first thing to come to mind. What I can definitely smell is leather and... what I can only describe as the smell of fancy wooden furniture. Since I'm only 20 I don't have a whole lot of experience with old books, so that's probably why. 
 The soothing properties are just as great. The only stinging I felt was what I think is the alum, but I didn't have any nicks or irritation. Post shave feel is a little oily, but that went away pretty quickly. I'd say it's on par with every other balm I've used. 
 The manufacturer says this will be offered for only a limited time. I wish it was a permanent addition, because I think it would go great as my signature fall and winter scent. I would even wear a cologne of it, and I've never worn cologne before.","Amazing manly scent, great soothing properties. Wish it was a permanent product. Pour VERY carefully! 9/10.",20,M,wicked_edge
"Me and my girlfriend have been dating for just over two and a half years. I'm 19 and shes turning 19 monday.  Tomorrow we are celebrating her birthday as we both have school. Recently we had our largest conflict as a relationship.  She is going to an art school a half hour away and I'm going to a community college for another year and she has been distant lately and enjoying the college life. Long story short she had considered just wanting the college life but we talked a lot and weighed the options and she said she is going to try a lot harder.  Part of the problem is the fact that after all this time, we've just become used to each other, kind of lost the spark.  I'm just wondering if you have an advice on keeping that spark going. 
 This all happened a couple of days ago and tomorrow we are going to celebrate her birthday.  I already bought her some shoes and a jacket she wants and am making her some personal coupons and cooking her a nice dinner tomorrow night, but I have almost ran out of money.  I was planning on taking some salsa dancing lessons with her but the place closed down and i was going to surprise her with a motel for the night and some rose petals on the bed with some wine, but like I said i'm low on funds.

"HI Reddit! I am a 22 year old female who has been with my boyfriend Sean(changed) for over 4 years now. We have an awesome relationship and are really best friends and work well together in all types of situations. Except this one. 
 His best friend Jon (25) has a girlfriend named Ali (23). They have been together for about 2 years now, and have many issues and problems throughout the relationship. Sean and I try to stay out of it for the most part because it isnt any of our business. Last year we would hang out with Jon and Ali every week, and Ali and I became really close. Out of the blue one day A got really nasty with me. We were talking about to possibility of going on a vacation together to hawaii (using a timeshare) and Ali said to Jon ""ohlooktwopigs wont pay her way through... Sean will pay. I'm not going because she isnt paying...I need to save my money!"" which I was taken back and responded that I would not make Sean pay for my plane ticket. She ignored me and continued to shut down Jon every time he mentioned it (he really wanted to go) I let it go and we went on with our lives. 
 NYE this year Ali sat in the corner at our party pouting the whole time. When we took out the champagne she make remarks of it being warm and didnt taste very good, then went up to bed without really saying much to any of us and left first thing in the morning. There have been other instances where she has been snippy or rude with me, but for the sake of the post I'll only talk about a few. 
 So we havent spoken since, but Jon keeps on asking Sean to hang out with the 4 of us, and Sean (my boyfriend) can't seem to understand why I am holding a grudge about this and he thinks I am crazy. I just dont want to hang out with Ali if she's going to be rude to me. I don't tolerate that and keep that sort of thing out of my life. Sean has taken this frustration with Ali as me not liking his friend Jon .I am at a loss and have no idea what to do or say to my boyfriend or to Ali.",Rude friend's girlfriend is rude.

"Okay so I'm in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend of nearly 2 years and I've been making some pretty big mistakes. I've been caught up in lies both old and new. All of which are involving women at work. The most recent being that I went to a birthday party for 2 of them, a party that I was going to because I couldn't go to my jobs Christmas party. Normally I'm calm, cool, and collected. Under the influence of alcohol I'm not. I was going to this party as sort of a make up for not going to the Christmas one. Things at this party got out of control. I got very drunk and ended up kissing one girl and touching a few others inappropriately. During the party I didn't stay in contact with my gf because I didn't want her to know I was getting drunk. Before I know it 6-7 hours had passed and it was 4am. In all honesty she wouldn't have cared if I went to the party, she would not have tried to stop me. It's not in her character to do that sort of thing. She would have just told me to be careful and maybe got a bit depressed from me going. The next day I called out from my first job. She knew something was wrong she knew I wasn't right. I was hung over. But I denied it. She let it go completely. And for a month or so everything was ok. Then one night she was browsing Facebook and stumbled upon a few photos from that night. When she confronted me about it I denied it again, lying to her again and even went as far as to swear on her life that nothing had happened. 
 I love this girl and I want to spend my life with her. When I say to you she's perfect I mean just that. She would never hold me back never be unfaithful never do anything unless it was helpful or beneficial to us. 
 I finally got around to partially coming clean telling her about going to the party but insisting that nothing unfaithful had happened. When in reality I kissed a girl and touched others. I lied and lied and lied...to a girl that doesn't deserve such lies. Still she gave me a chance, against the opinions of everyone, her friends and family. She risked looking like a fool to be with me. (I'm sure there are holes in this story I'll do my best to fill them in.) When I finally came completely clean to her about all that had happened, she was heartbroken. She said she was done with me. We didn't talk for almost 3 days till by a twist of fate my mother decided to call her. They didn't talk but her call prompted her to call me asking why. After a bit of a convo we found that we were both awaiting each other to message the other. We still wanted to be together. I had it set in my mind that o didn't want to cause her any more heartbreak. Because she is the absolute sweetest most caring person I have ever met. She doesn't deserve to have such hardships. Still we tried to reconcile. I could see and hear that she wasn't 100% towards the way she felt about me, which I could understand. With the things I did and the way I acted. We eventually came to the conclusion that I should visit for a week and with the help of a friend I bought the ticket. I'm due to go there the first week of May. Today is where the newest problem arises. In a conversation between us it came to the point where we were discussing Instagram (which I had hidden from her in the past and deleted and also didn't tell her about making a new one till only several months ago) she had asked me if I was going on the same girl that I kissed Instagram and liking pictures. I told her not in weeks. It turns out that I had liked some of her pics from more recently. She has always made it clear to me that she can't stand liars and every time she has to deal with another one she dies inside. I don't want to be that person. I truly do love her. I wonder if my problems with lying are mental? Shes just so upset with me (understandably so) and I don't want my trip to see her to be tainted with anymore evil or deceit on my part.

"I'm 31F, he's 35M. We've been together for 4 years, living in different cities. Half a year ago I felt that something's wrong. As I've finally pushed him to talk he confessed that he doesn't see me as a woman anymore, but greatly appreciates how cool and perfect I am and wants us to be friends. He's not lying, there's no other women, I can tell for sure. And as I listened to him I understood that he's having a 3-year crisis and doesn't know how to cope with it. I had it myself a year ago (like, who's this guy, what is he doing near me), and my shrink helped lots, I learned to appreciate him and not forget our best monents and why I love him. 
 I'm deeply upset, and I know I sound like an idiot, but is there any hope? Already told him that it's normal and that psychiatrists would help if he really cares about us. 
 I'm cool and funny, never nag, always ready to fuck him (because he's just gorgeous for me), share everything he's interested in, and never bored being by myself (I have tons of things to do, deeply loved job, lots of friends and interests). I always think about really cool presents half a year before his birthday, and he confirms that I'm the only one caring about what he likes.  And people say I'm hot) so it's not really me, it's a problem in his head which he doesn't know how to fix. 
 Is there a chance that he'd at least try to save our relationship? Like, go to the shrink, figure out the problem, etc? I don't mind if he does this and it doesn't help, at least he tried, but otherwise I feel like a totally insignificant thing not worth trying to keep.

"So my brother and I have quite a difference in age.  I'm 32 and he's 18.  He knows it all and I'm at the point where I've been knocked around by life enough times that I know I don't know anything at all. 
 Anyway, he came up to me last night bragging about his sales job he has.  I knew he was doing sales stuff but thought he was strictly a mattress salesman.  I figured he's selling something that you kind of have to buy brand new (used mattresses strike me as extremely gross unless you know the person who had it before and even then). 
 Turns out he's selling everything from furniture to appliances and told me all about how awesome it is and that I should become a sales guy as well.  I told him (partly in jest) that I have too many morals and couldn't sell people stuff they can't afford.  He laughed it off and told me how he thinks it's funny that he can do that.  He talked about the amazing 60 months same as cash plan and how the interest jumps up to 30% if you miss a payment and how funny it is that he can sign people up for deals like this.  It made me sick to my stomach. 
 To me this really hits home because I went broke once upon a time in my early 20s.  I woke up one day -$600 in the bank, making $30k a year, $40k in debt and bills were due.  It was one of the darkest periods in my life to say the least.  I got there largely because of my own stupidity and partly because people like my brother convinced me to spend way more than I had on stuff that I didn't really need.  So, his deliberately selling stuff to broke people really hits hard to me because I was one of those broke people once upon a time and even though it's been a decade I can still feel the pain.  His taking such glee just makes it worse to me.  I'm not sure how to deal with this. 
 He's 18 and because of the age difference I moved out of the house when he was 4 or 5.  We don't really have a relationship where I can talk to him and he'd actually listen to me.

 I have had the thought of getting a breast reduction in the back of my mind for a few years now, and I think current stress has elevated my related frustration and struggle to a breaking point. I am a 30G, in really excellent shape, and my breasts are the bane of my existence. I have back pain, scars on my rib cage from bras and sports bras, trouble finding tops that fit correctly, horrible posture, unwanted attention, general discomfort, and sleep issues. One of my biggest passions is running, and I truly feel like my breasts have prevented me from not only reaching my full potential but also from fully enjoying any form of physical activity. I joke to my friends (bitterly) that I have to make a choice between breathing and support when getting ready to run. The two sports bras (I have NEVER found a single sports bra sufficient, even ordering ridiculously expensive ones from overseas), chafing, back pain, and struggle to breathe make turn should be stress relief into a pain and frustration (to the point of tears at times).

"Two years ago I ended a 4 year relationship (my first) with a fundamentally religious man, Ben. 26M, not same ex as title. We were young, fell in love, but it was wrong for many reasons (including my agnostic ""beliefs""). I was fearful of the implications of our relationship, struggled with insecurity, and just decided I wanted outtie. 
 A few months later, he's already engaged (it's kind of how his religious community is) and I am crushing hard on one of our mutual friends, Tyler. I held Tyler's hand one night on a camping trip, and it was electric. I felt like a heartsick teen. From then on I just wanted to hold his hand all the time. 
 I'm sure he was aware he was acting the part of an emotional rebound, but I honestly didn't think of him that way. Our close friendship evolved as we talked through my post-breakup logic and spent more and more time just being in each other's company while we read or studied, even if we weren't talking or interacting. He kept telling me that he couldn't stop thinking about me, and I definitely couldn't stop thinking about him. However, we quickly realized that becoming close was hurtful to Ben (still in the circle of friends), who despite his engagement was struggling with coming to terms with our break-up, and chose to stop. 
 A month later, I accompanied Tyler to the hospital, and spent all night next to him to make sure he was going to be alright. The next day, I checked in on him in and we kissed. After that, it progressed to sex in a relatively short amount of time (days, not minutes). I believe he actually had strong feelings for me at this point. 
 But alas, I was ready to apply to med school. It was my professional goal, and my family was pressuring me to relocate to the east coast. I remember being very torn. I felt guilty for dating a mutual friend and hurting my ex, I felt insanely happy for being with Tyler, but I also felt that our relationship was doomed. 
 
 Tyler doesn't want kids now (although he said he might with the right person) and this is a definite yes for me in the next decade or so 
 I was probably moving  
 All our friends were in a strange limbo between camps 
 
 It was a weird situation, but we talked and Tyler said he wasn't ready for an extra serious relationship anyway. We would just end the relationship when I moved, since LDRs don't last. 
 So that just happened. We had a great 1.5 years and spent a lot of time making the most of the summer. Walking through parks, eating out, playing board games and drinking. It truly felt like a wonderful relationship. 
 And over the course of the last 5 months, I've realized that I completely regret the deadline I put on the relationship. At the time of applying to schools, we were still in the early stages and weren't talking about long-term anything. I felt completely justified to further my career and my dreams and become the doctor I wanted to be. It made sense to move back to my family, because my grandparents were struggling and my family is always going to be in my life. 
 Tyler was a new addition, someone who made me happy, but not someone for whom I was going to change my life goals. ...And yet, over the past half year, something changed. I realized how much I really cared for, and even loved, Tyler. It was a truly terrible experience to leave for med school. We both cried. 
 I refrained from telling him I loved him in our last months, since 1. I was pretty sure he didn't actually love me, 2. He's very nice and I didn't want to pressure him into saying or doing things to preserve my feelings, 3. I didn't want to complicate things before I left. 
 We did talk about how to handle the aftermath, and he seemed pretty convinced that we could still talk and be friends. So we're trying that now. We keep updated on our every day activities, text photos, frustrations, craigslist finds. But it's hard, and for me it's very sad, and it hurts. 
 After a text from him saying that he missed me, I started writing a letter to him and I didn't stop. It described how I felt, how I loved him, and how my feelings didn't crystallize until the last half year. How I accepted my program because I wasn't sure I would get another chance like this again, and my dream career was calling. How I felt like I had a hole ripped out of my heart, and how I couldn't even feel bad for myself because it was my own doing. I told him that I could only write the letter because I knew it would change nothing, but my heart really needed that cathartic release. 
 Tyler read it and said he appreciated it, but did not respond to my talk of feelings, telling me ""I guess I'm not good with my feelings either or something. I dunno."" So clearly my feelings weren't reflected, oh well. 
 Here's my problem though. I have had a great relationship, have known a great and wonderful person, and certainly don't mind his e-company and advice as I adjust to my new city. But our uncertain boundaries, my latent feelings and his being an attractive and successful man mean I'm probably not going to be able to handle it if and when he tells me he's dating again. I feel like I depend on him too much in his new friend role, but I'm too afraid to just end it. He's my best friend. I'll be alone, in a new city. And I miss him to pieces. 
 I've read a lot of advice on here, and the usual conclusion is to just end communications entirely. That it's the only way to heal.

"Not officially my first but the first that actually mattered to me was terrible and amazing at the same time. 
 Small backside story: about 3-4 years back when I was ~16 years old and i'd been taking the bus to school for a year and every morning this girl gets in 4 stops later. And from the first moment i saw her i knew she was special. However for almost a full schoolyear i'd been too shy to go talk to her so whenever she got on the bus we ""secretly"" look at each other and smile blabla usual 16y/o stuff igues. I'd told a friend of mine about her and he made a fool out of me since she was just ""this girl on the bus"". At the end of the year a friend of mine texts me saying this girl in her class went nuts when she saw a picture of me on my friends laptop and shouted ""Hey! that's that boy from the bus!"" So after that i messaged busgirl and we started talking. This was at the end of the year I saw her ~2 more weeks in the bus saying only ""hi"" to each other n stuff but it was all k. When her parents left on vacation she was all alone for 3 weeks so i spent just about every day at her place talking and doing things. (Note we both knew we falling in love but neither of us wanted to take the first step) 
 Anyway. 3 weeks into summer vacation spending all my time with her on a Friday. I was gonna leave to Italy with my parents for a 2 week holyday but i just HAD to  see her that day. She was done working so i went there and we cooked dinner together. at about 9 my mom calls me saying I had to come home to help pack the car up so we could leave around 3 in the morning. I told her and i packed my stuff. Then it hit me. I wasn't gonna see her for 2 weeks and i hadn't kissed her yet. so i knew what to do. BUT stupidly shy me was afraid to so i decided we could talk some more at her garden gate. We talked and talked and talked and talked for about 3 hours, my mom had called me 2 more times and started to get mad about me not being home yet, but yea.. hadn't kissed her yet ._. Then my mom calls again, we both hear my phone vibrate and i was like fuuuuuckkkk she says: ""shouldn't you answer that?"" Only thing i could say was ""no"" she goes ""sure?"" , ""yea im sure"", ""really sure?"" ""really sure"" and then she kissed me. Damn it felt AMAZING and i was so happy at that point. I said i really really really had to go at that point and kissed her again and left.

Not the other 2 tho, god damn she turned into a first class bitch after the first year.","since this got WAY too long:  Met a girl in the bus, been seeing her for 3 weeks and the night before i wen't on a holiday we stood 3 hours at her garden gate until we finally kissed.",16,M,AskReddit
"Hello fellow redditors. As of late I have been content as a full time factory trained technician. I bought my own condo at age 23, with no outside help. I have a nice new(er) car and built my own motorcycle. 
 Things were going well, until I was laid off. 
In the automotive industry there is an annual drop in business over the winter in new england. both due to economy and weather. I have grown somewhat tired of this and now having been laid off, realize I need to do something else with my life.

 You pose a really difficult question. As long as you're a gentleman, I see no problem with approaching a girl my age in public. Most girls are used to this and the worst that could happen is that she'll turn you down. 
 If this seems tricky to you (and I totally understand why it could), try a dating site. I was on OKC for a while and they have a section where you specify your preferred age range. It's a real easy way to find women who are younger, but open to you. I made it clear in my profile that only significantly older men needed apply!

"My boyfriend (27) and I (26) met 8 months ago during a short course we were taking together. We started dating 6 months ago. We saw lots of each other during the course because we had the same classes. After the course ended we began hanging out maybe once or twice a week on average, usually once in the middle of the week and once on the weekend. 
He says that I'm his first real girlfriend, so I believe he is used to being pretty independent and doing his own thing. I have no problem with this. I got out of a long relationship just 18 months ago so I'm not looking to move in with him or spend ever day with him by any means. I enjoy my own independence and have a separate group of friends that I catch up with regularly. I am a little concerned, however, that we still only see each other 1-2 times a week 6 months in. And we don't really text each other much in between times. We can go days without any communication. We are both really busy and I'm not suspicious of infidelity or anything. He regularly initiates contact, so its not like its just me always going to him. He appears to be pretty keen when I do see him. But in truth I would like to see him more, or even if I can't see him more, I'd like to have more regular contact. I guess I'm just scared of appearing too clingy, so I haven't asked him. He seems like he is happy with the amount of contact as it is. I'm also afraid that if I try to push for more contact we might end up getting sick of each other. 
Is it normal to only see someone 1-2 times a week after six months? And go days without contact? Or am I worrying over nothing?",I only see my boyfriend 1-2 times a week and sometimes we go days without contact.

"I don't think this is right.  The proper way to solve this is to use the [heat diffusion equation]( 
 This logic doesn't work because the larger the mass of the brick, the larger the surface area.  So the rain won't cool down the larger bricks any faster or slower than the smaller bricks.  The rate of heat transfer between the brick and water is proportional to the surface area, but so is the heat capacity of each brick, assuming they have the same depth. So  the heat capacity per area of each brick is the same, which is the relevant physical quantity . 
 Think about what would happen if I put water on one brick and then let it cool, versus cutting the same brick/water system in two, putting half of the amount of water on half of one brick, twice. Would the time-dependent temperature be different? No. 
 So I don't think this logic works.  Rather my best guess is different porousness of the bricks.

 I am 25 f and he is 27 m. Been together 3 years and married a little over a year. 
 First off thank you everyone for your input. Well, its been good and bad. Mostly good though! He was very open when I approached him. He said that he does it maybe once a week (having snooped his phone I believe that) and only when I turn him down or during shark week if I'm not up for it. He said that it doesn't mean he loves me any less or differently, and that his habits have always been this way and it's never effected the bedroom. This is true . I explained my insecurities, and while he understands he doesn't plan on not watching. That's fine, I didn't ask him to. I watch around once a month and told him. I'm glad we talked and had no fighting. 
 Here's where it gets sort of bad. Back to the top I said I snooped his phone. I know, i know. There was only one day in the last month with anything. What bothered me was that it is jasmincam, which allows you to interact. He can barely text on his touch screen phone, so I doubt he was saying anything. It is still bothering me a bit, but I can't say anything without fessing up which would cause a huge fight that I don't need. Also, the day after our long talk, he went and liked some page on Facebook that is all half naked ladies. I know, just another guy thing, but it still bugged me.

"I'm about to turn 23 tomorrow and would definitely consider myself a gamer - it started out with Game Boys, an SNES, a Mega Drive / Genesis and over time I managed to get a hand on every major console released in the last 15 years as well as a gaming pc up until about 5 years ago. For each system I'd owned (and subsequently sold to get money for newer generations) very sizable libraries from big releases to obscure oddities. 
 Now a couple of years ago (must've been when I was around 17, so ca 2005) I started playing less and less because real live invaded. I was about to finish school, had more friends, a couple of changes in livestyle that ultimately made me realize the worth of being around people, going out for drinks, to dance, working a job that earned me comparatively much money, girlfriend, travels etc. My priorities in life shifted a lot and I reduced my nerd bouts to just books, movies and the internet. 
 Last week I got handed down a decent Panasonic LCD TV, dusted off my roommates PS1, bought a couple of games and we've been having hectic (Tekken 3-) tournaments in our flat ever since. It's glorious!
Also the first time in ages that I've picked up a controller on my own initiative. Nostalgia and the novelty of having a TV again (blame the internet and shitty German private channels) get the better of us. 
 I reckon that's a pretty generic story for lots of people but the thing is while there's barely any incentive for me to actually play aside from the events of last week I'd been 'staying on top' of the industry as much as I could. I read / watch reviews of as many new games as I can manage, I lurk communities like this one, I'm theoretically srsly pr0 and logged 100s of hours (of youtube let's plays, walkthroughs, etc) with games I've never seen irl. 
 I can't say it's bothering me that I can't be bothered anymore, I've got lots of other stuff to do; but I find it weird (as do most people I tell this) that I get my fix through podcasts and dissertations on texture packs.

Relationship Ended 2 years ago 
 So the story goes as such, in my freshman year of college I fell head over heels right into an unhealthy relationship with my first boyfriend. A year and a half later during spring semester, we break up in the ugliest ways and this breaking up process spanned roughly 4 months. All in all, it was one of the roughest times in my life so far. I lost weight I already didn't really have, drank too much, failed my finals, lost all of my friends but two, forced myself to sleep so I wouldn't have to think.. This list could keep going. 
 Here I am now, 2 years post break-up and I'm wondering if what I feel could be a result of that break up? I'm currently in another relationship with a boy who treats me as humans should be treated; I'm happy. However, I'm anxious. I have a general unwell feeling and perhaps you could label it as paranoia that I worry my world could fall from under my feet again at any given second and I would be left exactly in the same situation as two years ago. Very alone and very sad. 
 I felt these same emotions of uneasiness last spring. I thought maybe it was just stress from finals being around the corner among other problems at the time, but now that it has happened again this spring, I am wondering if it could be PTSD perhaps? Any insight would be great while I sit here and try to study for my finals but my stomach's queasy and I'm paranoid af for an entire month.","2 years ago during the spring there was a majorly prolonged and bad break up from a first-time relationship that lasted 1.5 years.

"I'll start with the facts: I am 20, she is 18. We've been dating for 3 years, and I'm sure at this point it won't last. 
 To start: I do still care about her, I just don't see it lasting long-term. Too many fights/arguments about silly/pointless things, and no chance of change in the future. 
 A few of the troubling things: 
 
 She's incredibly jealous, but isn't willing to admit it. The moment I mention that I talk to/talked to a girl, she jumps to her 'joking' ""You can't talk to other girls!"" statement. 
 
 She's controlling. I can't do anything without first getting her permission. If I want to go workout at the rec center on campus, I'll have to call her first to tell her where I'm going, why, and how long. If I don't she gets upset at me and we fight about it. 
 
 She's too emotional for me. It's not that she's a bad person, it's just that I don't want to be with someone this emotional for the rest of my life. 
 
 She's manipulative. She'll twist my words and try to make me feel guilty to get her way. She'll try to guilt-trip me into thinking it's my fault, or that I shouldn't do something. 
 
 Her mom is a little crazy. I've heard a million times to look at the mother as some sort of indication as to her future. She's a lot like her mom in several ways (controlling, manipulative, emotional) 
 
 She's very dependent on me. While I don't mind a dependent girl, I don't want someone that can't operate without me there. She's a lot like OAG - she can't sleep unless we're on Skype. 
 
 There are plenty of other reasons, but I'm sure this is what I want, so I won't waste your time with those... 
 
 
 The background on why breaking up is hard: she's very dependent (mentioned earlier), and I worry that me breaking up will cause her problems (how can I do it in a way that she doesn't give up on everything else she has going?). We had sex before she was past the age of consent. I've done a bit of legal-searching, and it appears that because it's been a year since she's been past the age of consent, I can't go to prison for statutory rape. However, her mom is crazy (mentioned before) and has threatened me with ""ruining my life"" if i break her daughter's heart. 
 I guess my main question is this: 
When I break up with her, should I do it in the car, or while out doing something? Should I let her drive home, or do it where I'm driving, so she doesn't have to drive home upset? Should I do anything to try to console her (like a note or something?) As I said before, I do care about her, so I don't want to be an ass... I just know that we won't last long term, at least not happily...","I think it's time to breakup with my girlfriend, how should I do it with as little heartbreak for her as possible?

"Hello Reddit, 
 So here's another miserable story from the middle east and I'm here for your advice so please bear with me. 
 I'm a 21 years old male, call me Jack for now, I study Engineering at a highly ranked institute in a middle eastern country, I come from an upper middle class family, I'm agnostic but my family are muslims. 
 There is this girl in class with me, let's call her Anne, so I never really liked Anne or was attracted to her, let me describe her, to me she was never beautiful, she wears a pair of eye glasses and a head scarf you know the one that covers hair and neck. 
 Now I'm not sexy or attractive myself, not at all, I have a lot of issues from Middle and High school, I've never been with a girl, and of course I'm a virgin. 
 So lately I became close friends with Anne, she's really a sweet heart, quite fun to be around and really really nice, plus she gives me a hard on. 
 Yes she's not the most beautiful girl I've known but she turns me on for some reason. 
 Lately she's been on a diet and lost some weight, took her glasses off and put some makeup, she looks pleasant now, but not beautiful however, anyway a while ago she's told a mutual friend she likes me, and since then I've sort of tried to keep her away from me so she wouldn't be heart broken. 
 Recently I think I started to develop feelings for her, she's the nicest girl to me, as a friend of course. 
 Now this is how things go in the middle east, you like a girl, you propose to her family, engagement for a while and then marriage, and the best I'll get close to her during that period is holding hands, not even hugs. 
 At this point I'm not sure if I'm starting to like her because I'm horny and miserable or because I love her, the trade off is quite heard, I can't propose to her when I'm not sure of my feelings, that would break her heart later. 
 I'm not sure how to handle this and it's been troubling me lately, please help me.","I'm a 21 years old virgin who thinks he likes his friend, not sure if I'm just horny or do I really like her.",21,M,relationships
"A little background on me, I think it's relevant: 
 23 year old heterosexual male. I've had sex with 11 different people, and I've ""been in love"" (i.e. been infatuated/head over heels/whatever you want to call it) probably 3 times. I've always been an incredibly passionate, romantic  person. Out of those 11 times, only one has been a one night stand; the rest have either happened in a relationship or in the pursuit of a relationship. In other words, for the most part, I only have sex with people if I am interested in a relationship, or already in a relationship with them. 
 I've never been the type for one night stands or friends w/ benefits type situations. In fact, the only one night stand I've ever had  turned into  a relationship, so I guess by definition it wasn't a one night stand other than the fact that we had sex the first night we met. 
 Anyway, here's my problem; right now I'm not interested in anything other than a serious relationship. People seeking serious relationships seem to be few and far between, which has been bumming me out. I'm not actively trying to meet anyone -- my approach lately (one that seems to be healthy for me) is to just have the mindset of, if someone comes along, great! I won't fight it. But if not, I'm not going to make a fuss about being single. I'm pretty content with being single, as it allows me to work on and focus on bettering myself. 
 That being said, in the last couple of years, my problem has been that when I meet someone, and there's mutual interest, when things start to progress, I'll end up having sex with them almost immediately. I know that sounds strange. What I mean is, in a typical situation, what will happen is, we'll like each other, talk a lot, etc. And then when we finally kiss/make out, we end up having sex. Like that. And I usually don't want to rush into it so quickly. 
 Not out of fear, but simply because (for me) sex is somewhat of a sacred thing. I'm not religious at all, and I'm not without my own desire and sexuality, but sex for me is something that I take seriously and only want to experience with someone who I care about and am comfortable with. It's also a slightly stressful thing to me, because I am always  very  concerned with pleasing my partner. I don't have any ""performance"" issues or anything that I'm aware of. I can last as long as several hours if I want to, I don't have any fetishes or habits that have ever made anyone uncomfortable, and I can usually get the other person to achieve orgasm one way or the other (with oral/fingering, giving an orgasm with penetration alone is rare for me). 
 Unfortunately, being a typical, straight male, when one thing leads to another, it's hard for me to stop it, because my  other head  takes over my ability to make decisions. Even if I don't initiate anything at all beyond kissing, the person I'm with will usually keep taking things further, and it takes a lot of willpower to say no. And if I  do  say no, it seems to ruin it for them. They seem to think it's because I'm not attracted to them, or because I'm weird, etc. It doesn't seem to matter how I approach it or word it. And if I go with it, and sleep with the person, of course I'm unable to give it my all, or even enjoy it much myself, just because I feel like I'm being rushed. 
 I hate it. It's not like I want to wait months to have sex with someone I'm seeing. But, you know, a week or two would be nice. I just want to be comfortable around them and get to know them before committing to an act that is serious to me. It's actually gotten to the point that I will lie, and say, ""Oh shit, I don't have a condom"", but that backfires if they have one. I don't have unprotected sex with anyone unless we're deep into a relationship and we know we're clean, and they're on the pill. 
 Am I just weird for wanting to take it slow? Am I taking sex too seriously? Do I need to change my perspective? How can I gracefully tell a potential partner that I'm not comfortable moving so fast, without making them feel awkward? Are other people probably just as uncomfortable with sleeping with me so soon, but just initiate because it's the ""norm""? If so then why do they react with apparent disappointment when I ask them if we can take it slow? I would  love  any advice or help anyone here can offer. Thanks in advance!","I'm uncomfortable with having sex with a partner before dating for at least a couple weeks and getting to know them, how do I tell them I want to take it slow without putting them off or making them feel awkward?",23,M,sex
"I'm going to word vomit and edit this later. 
 I (m/26) fell in love with a girl (f/22) who was separated from her husband.  They were high school sweethearts, got pregnant and married by the time they were 19.  I met her though a friend, hit it off, I was just out of a relationship and wasn't looking for anything, found out each others story, met her child, we had fun together, start talking. We talk for about a month before we hook up and shortly after we start dating and we were ""engaged"" about 9 months later.  I say ""engaged"" because she was still legally married, though they were living an hour away from each other. 
 During our time together I learned a lot about life, love and myself.  I feel like we jammed a few years of a relationship into a couple months, with basically becoming a step-father to her, just turned, two year old.  Dealing with new feelings, emotions, helping her figure out the divorce (though it was never filed) and having both of our pasts creep up on us.  Just lots of drama for a little while.  Trust broken, but we got through it. 
 Anyway, I feel like I've known her a lifetime and we have both grown so much since our first meeting, which wasn't even a year ago. 
 Our engagement was called off over two arguments that happened back to back days.  Religion and a situation involving her drug addicted brother.  We called it off. 
 We were split up for nearly 2 months, I was doing the single thing and she was figuring her life out.  Then she contacts me telling me she was pregnant and it was mine.  We happily got ""back together"" everything was great until - long story short.  Found out it wasn't mine (she was convinced it was but she had hooked up with her (ex)Husband weeks after we split and the ultrasound more closely matches him than me) 
 Anyway, so now shes pregs.  I thought it was mine for a week.  They already know they do not get along, she does not love him, they are just friends/co-parents and shes going to get an abortion on Saturday (she hasn't told him) only told her mother, grandmother and myself.  I'm going to go with her to the appointment. 
 Now, my question. Logically, I should get the hell out of here and should count my lucky stars that I dodged a bullet right?  But I still love her.  We've put each other through hell and back and still love her and I've broken up with girls for tiny reasons. 
 When we were broken up and I had flings, I could not stop thinking about her.  I hate her guts, but I love her to death.  My brain and my heart are at war and I really do feel fucking stupid that I'm even contemplating being with her. 
 That's what I'm stuck on. I really am at a loss of what to do.  Logical response and emotional response. What the fucking fuck. 
 Keep in mind, I've had my fair share of relationships.  I'm not retarded.  I'm not afraid to break up with girls and move on.  I've had a relationship that lasted 7 years with my high school sweetheart and we broke up for very mature reasons. 
 I'm literally afraid that she's the one.  And I can't explain it. I can't explain why... And I'm afraid I when I'm 75 years old, sitting at my grandkids house starring out the window, I'll be thinking ""what if?"" and regretting being too upset to not put aside my pride and anger and dealing with the real life of love and that it's not butterflies and rainbows like in the fairy tales. 
 But my brain tells me. Dude, she's going to ruin your life.

"I am 31 years old, 6'0"" and 362 lbs. My weight throughout my adult life has hovered around 330. I used to weigh 374 at my heaviest and that went down to 319 when I was working out. That was four years ago, and for a variety of reasons/excuses, I stopped working out. 
 I was just diagnosed with sleep apnea, as I long suspected, which accounted for my frequent fatigue. I'm getting that taken care of right now and I expect a huge change in my life and as such, I consider it an excellent opportunity for me to resume making proactive changes in my life. 
 However, one of the things that holds me back is my severe exercise-induced asthma. This was one of the factors that made me heavy - starting at age 9. I keep it controlled via preventive medication (Advair) and have inhalers if need be. But still, sometimes, I guess, I overdo it and then I'm out of commission for several days. It's such a huge, discouraging obstacle in my life because I don't want to miss work and school. 
 So I am hitting the gym starting next week. I need help planning on the routine I should start out with. I don't know how much cardio and weightlifting I should do for a man of my size and life circumstances.

"I'm an 18 F dating an 18 M. We have an awesome sex life, we have sex as much as we can considering that we live with our parents and all that. I orgasm pretty often - most of our sexual encounters begin with him getting me off with his fingers which is great, though we would both like me to orgasm more and from PIV (sometimes if I touch myself enough during PIV I orgasm but it's not a sure thing). 
 Sometimes I get really horny and want to masturbate, but then I feel as though me getting off by myself might ruin my orgasms with him - I'm scared that if I masturbate too much on my own I would have a harder time reaching an orgasm with him. I know that that's how it works for guys, like, their sexual stamina can weaken with too much masturbation. But women can have more orgasms than men so does that mean that I can masturbate without fearing I'm making myself less likely to orgasm with him? I sometimes refrain from masturbating the day before I know we'll have sex but I haven't taken notice of a difference if I masturbate or not. I want to know if there's some science reason that can tell me either way. 
 For clarification - I definitely get horny all the same when I'm with him, even if I do masturbate. So it's not really regarding my libido, I think.

"When I was kindergarten, we had three deaf kids in the class with us.  The teachers tried to teach us sign language, but the only thing that I got out of it was how to say ""yes"" and ""no.""  Every day we would have about a half hour to play with all of the stuff they had, one of which was a educational video game.  Everyone always wanted to play this game.  One day, one of the deaf girls was playing.  I think she had just started, but being the selfish 5 year old that I was, I thought I deserved to play more than she did.  So i tapped her on the shoulder and just signed ""no,"" then pointed at the teacher, while shaking my head, as if to say the teacher told her to stop.  She quickly got off and I took her spot and started playing.  At the time I felt like a little genius, but looking back, that was kind of a jerk move, especially to someone who already had it pretty rough.","Tricked deaf girl into letting me play video game, even though it was her turn.",5,M,AskReddit
"I was the one doing the breaking up, and it's quite possibly the shittiest thing I've ever done. I'd been with this girl for about a month at this point, it's spring break my Junior year in high school. My friends and I are going to have a bonfire at a beach about 20 miles outside of town, lots of people going to be there, so of course my girlfriend should be there, too. 
 The only problem with this plan was that the beach was 20 miles from my house. My girlfriend was another 20 miles in the opposite direction, and she didn't have a car. So in order for her to go to this bonfire, I would have to drive from my house, 20 miles to her place, then 40 miles out to the beach, then 40 miles back to her place to drop her off that night, then 20 miles back to my house. That was 120 miles of driving, my truck got about 12 miles to the gallon and I didn't make very much at the time. So I did the only logical thing - I broke up with her by text message because I knew that she could receive them, but not reply back. It was a shitty, horrible thing to do. 
 And now, 9 years later, we've been together for 9 years (wasn't a long breakup) and married for 3.",Broke up with my girlfriend by text message because I didn't have gas money.,21,M,AskReddit
"My boyfriend [20M] and I [20F] have been together for almost 7 months now. We get along great. 
 We're both each other's first relationship and everything has been the ""first"" for either of us. Kissing, holding hands, cuddling, sleeping in the same bed together, and touching anywhere except the major genital area -- down there. Our clothes have not come off, although he jokes about sex a lot (and I mean a lot)! We both have expressed our interest in having sex with each other. We're both virgins. So, sadly, after a bit of intense making out and rolling around, he's left my apartment with pain in his genitals multiple times, which I'm assuming is something you call ""blue balls"". 
 We've seriously spoken about it many times, it appears neither of us are fully ready to go through with sex. For me, I would want to be on birth control before simply having him go in with just a condom (if anyone wants to express their view towards this, please do so). I just want to be really careful. 
 My boyfriend seems to have some body image issues and some other insecurities that makes him very hesitant to even take off his shirt. He's overall quite shy about his body since he's basically my height, 5'6"", and is skinny. (I think he looks good, though!) Like, he doesn't wear t-shirts in public even when it's really hot since he thinks he looks too skinny. He hates the beach or pool. He only wears t-shirts when I beg him to, when we're cuddling and it gets a bit warm. He mentioned his insecurities in passing, but aside from perhaps body image, I don't know what his insecurities could be, if any others exist. 
 I feel like these insecurities may be what's keeping him from moving forward and having sex with me (aside from me not being on birth control). Obviously, he doesn't want me to get pregnant and is very worried about that. 
 How can I open him up to feeling comfortable about himself? How can I figure out what he's ""insecure"" about? I shouldn't just ask him...or should I? Have you felt insecure about anything, before your first time? If so, about what? Are there any ways I could/should help him feel more comfortable about his body?

"The Situation 
 My husband's birthday is in two weeks and I've been scouring through all of our pictures to make something really special for him. He has a couple external hardrives which I thought just had pictures and movies. I ran across some weird things while looking for pics of us. I wasn't even snooping. I ended up finding several folders of screenshots with my Husband (then boyfriend) talking to girls either on Chatroullette/Omegle and Skype. Hundreds of pictures. Literally over years. And most of the girls looked to be between like 15 and 18. Fucked up. 
 I'm shaking at this point and I now start snooping legitimately. I guessed his email and fb passwords and I've been looking through all of his emails and messages. Dumb ass didn't delete anything. The picture I've been able to put together is he started talking to girls off these type of sites in 2009 and has been doing it consistently since then. There are like 4 girls he talks to regularly. One started when the girl was 15.... in his defense it doesn't seem like anything sexual is going on but its weird that he is basically best friends with a HS Freshman. Two are 18 now.... 16 or 17 when it started up. And another one is HS aged. I can't figure out her exact age though. She looks young. 
 Basically he has been having cyber sex, nude chats, personal chats with three of the four girls. The one thing that is sickening to me and makes me want to die is that he had actual sex with one of them. Last year before we got married he got cold feet and broke up with me and we were not together for a month. During that month he went to visit his teenage girlfriend and fucked her for a week straight. And then came back to me and told me he made the biggest mistake of his life and loves me and wants to marry me. 
 I'm furious at him. I'm disgusted by him. This is so fucked up. We haven't even been married for that long and we've been trying to have a baby. And now this. He is basically a huge fraud. I don't know if I don't know him or if he changed or what. I haven't confronted him yet and don't know how to. Is there any way our marriage can survive this? I don't want to get divorced after less than a year Kardashian style but I really don't think I can look at him the same anymore. Any, any help is appreciated.

"Me (f/28), my boyfriend (m/37) ""josh"", and our friend (m/25) ""gabe"" are all pretty close. We work together, not like an office job, and not all the time, more accurate to say we work on projects together, where my boyfriend is always the boss. 
 To josh and I, gabe is like our little buddy. We take care of him, and he looks up to us. By take care of I mean get him work here and there, oftentimes with us (josh and my's business), we buy him shit, have him stay at either of our places, etc. He has always been basically a little brother to me, not even cause of the age (I'm not really that much older than him) but because its the nature of our friendship. Gabe always thinks of me as his boss. I always give him shit about that and say ""I'm you're friend! Not boss!"" And we laugh. No big deal. 
 Gabe and I are close in a big sister/lil brother kinda way and I really never questioned that. To be honest, he's a really good looking guy, but through some personal trauma, he has cut himself off from being ""experienced"" with the ladies. And on my end, I love him, and I know he's good looking, but who he is is just not anything I'm attracted to. Love as a friend, but no attraction. And to be more frank, he's actually a little bit out of my league, I think. I'm pretty cute, but he's hot. Which I only mention because I never thought he would have a crush on me. 
 So I partied with gabe a few weeks ago, like I normally do here and there, and his friend drunkenly told me he had a crush on me. I seriously didn't believe it, and said as much, but the friend was saying that yes, for sure, he does, gabe said so. This is seriously out of nowhere, and I never would have guessed. We don't flirt. We joke around like siblings. If anything I can be kind of a jerk to him sometimes. This whole thing seriously blows me away. The only explanation I can come up with is that he looks up to me, doesn't have that many eligible ladies in his life, and is projecting onto me. 
 I won't lie, I feel very flattered, but I know my own fantasies and I'm not even attracted to him in fantasy. 
 I told josh about this (he just chuckled, I mean, this is seriously not an actual threat to our relationship) but I didn't tell gabe that his friend told me he liked me (sounds so middle school!) anyway, I dunno... If I should bring it up with gabe? I think I should ignore it because there's NO flirting that goes on with us, and once he finds someone he likes he'll get over it. It's just tripping me out. 
 Josh n I are pretty open sexually so the most that would happen is a threesome, but as hot as gabe is, I actually don't want that. It's too weird. It just sucks I don't feel like I can hang out with him the way I used to. We would crash at each others places all the time but now, especially cause I told josh, I don't think we should do that anymore, which is too bad, cause I love gabe. As secure and open as josh is, I don't want him to worry or question anything when i hang out with gabe, which I suspect he now would. 
I don't regret telling josh this stuff because I wanna be open, but i feel it may put a slight doubt in his mind, which is why I don't think I can hang with gabe the way I used to.

"I am a 37, soon to be 38 yr old male, who dated a woman (39f) for most of 2011. She was the first girl I dated since my divorce (2008) Things were fantastic until our relationship went on 'time out' a year ago last month.
For a while, I tried and tried to restore the relationship. I really thought she was the one. We had ONE huge blowout fight -- Stress in life had gotten to both of us. We both worked in Manhattan at the time and her mom got ill with cancer (since in remission.) The result of the fight was a ""time out."" We still talked daily via email and text. I even sent her xmas, valentines, birthday cards and gifts... poems, flowers, etc. trying to fix this because she truly did mean so much to me.
In our 'big argument' that caused this split, we both said some nasty stuff and it took until July for her to actually come around to hang out with me and talk face to face. We met a few times for coffee, hung out, chatted nicely but didn't go beyond that. By Sept. 2012, I had just about given up on any chance - she told me she was on online dating sites, so for my own sanity, I cut of contact.
I met and dated a girl briefly in Oct. and November, as well as tried to move on by going on dates with girls I met on some online dating sites. No sparks with anyone, always, this girl has lingered in the back of my mind.
With uncanny timing, the day I broke it off with the other girl I had dated briefly, I got a text message from the ex girlfriend. We resumed texting and emailing. Polite, how are you, etc... what is going on with life, work, family, etc. She is single still, I am single again and this communication continues but is utterly unsatisfying and seems to be going nowhere.
I asked to meet, face to face to talk and just figure out what this 'is.' I didn't demand or apply pressure or nag. I simply asked to meet for dinner, or a drink - whatever would be comfortable for her. I got a maybe. Its going on 3 weeks now, I have not asked again. I limit my attempts to reach out to her because in my opinion, if she wanted to she would reach out herself.
I know how I feel, and I can assume that there is some level of the same feeling on her part because through all of this she has tried to keep some form of contact with me. The situation is frustrating for me, because I don't know how to get this whole thing to a point of resolution without coming off as impolite or rude or whatever...
Some friends say I should be more assertive and just say ""meet me at x time and y location...' Some friends say delete her number and move on... I am torn between still having feelings, call it love even for her and knowing I that I deserve to be happy and treated well. I'm a cute dude, I have a great career, I am funny and intelligent and have a LOT going on for myself... yet I continue to let this situation linger because - I feel how I do for her...
All logic goes out the window when it comes to love... I heard a song on Pandora today... And, matter of fact, it was a love song, and the first thought I have is of her... and how much I miss her in my life...
Anyway, not sure how to even express it to her, because my past attempts have gotten lukewarm responses... sense says move on, heart says hang tough...","Guy meets girl, love ensues, life & pride cause a split, neither of us can completely let go... yet current state: unsustainable for my own piece of mind.",37,M,BreakUps
"Back in 2001 when I was in middle school, my parents were relatively well off and I was a self entitled brat. I thought 10 dollars a day was normal alongside a packed sushi lunch. I always wore designer clothes and gelled my hair in the butt crack formation. I used the excess funds to haggle for additional snacks during the day and that led to me being pudgy little fellow. 
 And so I was routinely bullied for my weight and appearance. Like every day. In hindsight I was the easiest of targets. One day I was late to gym class and as I walked past the student body who was 'dressed-in', one of my 'friends' yelled 'Hey gilligan, what'd you do, eat the skipper?' 100 kids started laughing at me and it was the most intensely humiliating moment of my life up to that point. 
 Emotionally scarred, I decided to lash out against the student body on the following day. 
 After second period, everyone was released to the rec area where there was a snack stand. The 'hot' new item was the krispy kreme donut that were delivered in a cruelly finite quantity, and so would sell out quickly. 
 So around 9:55 AM, just before the end of second period, I snuck out to the snack stand and asked for ""All of the donuts, please"". The attendant was also a faculty member, and to this day I cannot figure out why on earth he decided to fulfill my request. A 12 year old buying 24 donuts for a whopping 12 dollars should've garnered some suspicion. I guess he thought I was going to share them. 
 I proceed over to the holding pond within eyesight of the middle school classrooms. As soon as the bell rings, I start throwing the donuts into the pond one at a time. Nobody really notices what I'm up to for a few minutes until word spreads there are no donuts today because someone bought them. Little Parker, the squeaky kid, hollared ""Look at him! What's he doing?"" Then, they quickly realized their worst nightmare as donut after donut was desecrated. I proceeded to throw 20 or so in with faint mumblings and sadness from onlooking 12 year olds before the adults caught on 
 In the distance, I hear the principle running towards my back and yelling ""STOP! STOP! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? STOP!"" I paused for a moment, paralyzed by fear, and somehow decided to try and trick her, so I smeared chocolate all over my face from one of the donuts, then started cramming it into my mouth as I turned around in an effort to feign innocence. She grabs me and demands an explanation... I replied ""What's going on? I'm just eating donuts"". Meanwhile, there 20 miniature frosted live preservers floating in a 20 foot diameter pond just over my shoulder. 
 I was suspended for 3 days and never allowed to buy snacks again.","bought all the donuts from my middle school snack stand, threw them into the holding pond, got suspended for 3 days",38,M,tifu

"So really new to Reddit and all of this but nowhere else to post except Facebook and I don't want to be one of ""those people"".  Figured I would vent on here. 
 So anyways... 
 I am down and out today. After applying for a certain job I have wanted for years, I finally get an interview last week. Interview went well and the people seemed ready to hire me and told me they would get back to me. Well jump forward a week and I contact them but am told that they can't offer me a position because my certifications that weren't ever suppose to expire have ...expired.  Depressed to say the least. So I go through this long process all day being transferred from one person to the next to find out why my certifications were purged from the state records and find out it's because the employer who was suppose to certify me didn't submit all of the paperwork....didn't check one box on a form and just like that ..POOF.  Now the problem is that the certifications can only be obtained while employed by certain places og which there are a handful.  The people I interviewed with don't want to hire me because they can't afford to get me certified and I can't pay to do it on my own.  Sorry for being vague but that's just me. 
 Now I have bouts with depression and this really set me up for a downer day. You see my life sucks pretty hard....like harder than a Taiwanese hooker.    You want the details? Sure ya do because misery loves company. 
 You see I have a high school education and no real skills. I am a jack of all trades but master of none.  Spotty work history  due to being young and dumb or working for sketchy people.   The job above was a big chance to start a career....btw I am early 30's. I have no retirement, insurance, or future. 
 I have been a stay at home Dad for years. Busted my ass to put my ol' lady through school working craps jobs. She got out and started making OK money and decided it was easier for me to be a SaD. Ok, no problem right? Well  now no one wants to hire me because I have been out of the work force for years. 
 Now more fun.  I have no friends...seriously.  None.   I rarely leave the house(once a week to grocery shop) and outside of my kids and occasional phone call from my Dad I don't talk to anyone. Yea I have a Facebook but only 4 ""friends""  who are my family so they can see pics of the kids.   I have a PS3 with 2 ""friends"" who rarely game with me or don't play my old outdated games. 
 I have a SO(not married) as stated above but it's been a loveless relationship for some time. Haven't had sex or been touched in years. In fact found out a while back that one of my kids  I have been raising  isn't even mine.  Yup.  What can I do though? If I tell anyone she will kick me out and take my one kid away and make sure I pay Child Support on the one who isn't. Also  my folks aren't in the best health and don' think they could handle finding out that one of their grand kids isn't even theirs.   Oh and SO has been cheating for years....literally. 
 A couple years ago I sold off my entire hobby(15 years in the making) to buy Christmas gifts because she didn't buy a thing.   She went on a trip that Spring to Hawaii to see her other guy.  I haven't been any further than 20 miles from the house in 5 years. 
 Now you ask why don't I leave? Where would I go? No friends ,family can't afford to take me in, and I have nothing except one beat up old truck.  Literally have no assets. She controls all the money and outside of change I save from groceries I don't have any money and that I use to buy the kids little things.   If I leave she takes my kid(s) away because she can. She likes having a built in baby sitter/housekeeper/chef and  I have nothing so she knows I can't do anything about it. 
 I have holes in my shoes, holes in pants and in my heart.

"A couple of days back, after a few drinks with colleagues for a work event, I ended up sleeping with one of my colleagues. Despite us both being a little tipsy, it was consensual. We are soon-to-be-ex colleagues so it wasn't going to cause problems at work. 
 We are both single - I broke up with my GF of two years around six months ago and I still hadn't got over it. I thought it would 'get better' if I was to find someone else. Her last real relationship was around a year ago, and she mentioned that she hasn't had a serious relationship since other than the casual ones she had recently. 
 In the next week, both of us will be going our separate ways with her leaving her job and moving state for a couple of months (at least). I guess, the expectation wasn't for this to be serious given the situation. The next day, we said our goodbyes and I returned to the city (we were out of town for the work event) 
 However, 2 days later, she texted me that she was going to be in the city and wanted to see if we can hang out before she leaves for her new job. It was basically a booty call. 
 Some context before I go to the next scene: I broke up with my GF [ also 21F ] of a rather intense two years around six months ago. I haven't really gotten over it - still whinging about it at my low points during the day. I had become extremely lonely over the past few months. This was partly due to myself isolating from others - but also me sharing a number of friends with my ex who are now no longer in contact with me. I had become incredibly depressed with the loneliness. 
 Conscious of my depression, I somehow thought that finding someone else will fill the void and the loneliness. Given the circumstances, I expected that my colleague wasn't looking for anything serious - and I foolishly thought that I will be emotionally stable to treat it casually too. 
 This was not the case. When she came for the apparent booty call, we spent the whole day (and night) indoors having passionate sex. It felt great - but upsetting at the same time as when I tried to show affection (holding hands, gentle kissing) I felt that she was shying away? In a way, I was expecting that affection I had with my ex (Alarm bell: she looked and reminded me of my ex in many ways) but I wasn't getting any of it :-( 
 This was my first time in a casual relationship (I've always been in 'serious' intense relationships in the past) and I found it difficult to isolate my emotions when it came to love making. Even saying goodbye at the end was difficult. I felt as if she was quite blasé about it - she seemed ready to move onto her next adventure it seems like.  However, I felt even lonelier and empty than I had done previously. 
 Since then, I have constantly been thinking about our two nights together. We clicked - and although we kinda knew each other before, I gotten to know her a lot more during our nighttime conversations. I do sense that she likes me, but it's clear that she has been putting up a guard -  perhaps she knows that a relationship will end up bad, but I am unable to see it myself? 
 I tried to create distance as I knew I was getting emotionally involved: but she had been (naively?) contacting me about random topics and jokes over SMS and emails. It's been difficult to not get emotionally involved. Although it is not her to blame, it sometimes upsets me how she was seemingly able to isolate the physical nature of the relationship from the emotion. 
 I'm really confused - although I know deep inside my brain that our relationship probably wouldn't work given our future circumstances, I don't feel closure if I don't tell her how I feel. However, I am worried that it will backfire and she will distance herself completely from me with me burning bridges.",Had two nights of passionate casual relationship with a colleague.

"Okay, a little bit of backstory. About a year ago, for my 13th Birthday, my friend bought me ffxiv. I instantly fell in love with the game! It was my first ever experience with a MMO, and i found it to be amazing. I picked lancer at the beginning, because i saw the relic armor, and it reminded me of FFIV (My first final fantasy). I understood the Holy Trinity system pretty well. My job was to pretty much do as much damage as possible, without stealing aggro from the tank. Anyways, long story short, I hit 50 then i put the game down for awhile. 
 When i came back a few months ago, I decided to try to catch up for the expansion. Well i was playing one time, and some friends came over. They asked what i was playing, I explained to them i was playing ffxiv. They were interested so they got the free trial, and they too fell in love. 
 This is where my problem arises. My three friends picked, BLM, BRD, and WHM. They refuse to try other jobs, because they like their current one too much. So if i wanted to play with them i would have to be a tank. I thought to myself no biggie, I'll just level up gladiator. And so I did, getting all the way to PLD. And i love the playstyle of tanking, theirs just one problem. When playing with randoms in the DF, I get extremely nervous. So much so i start to feel sick.

"I met this girl at the end of my junior year in high school. I was with a couple of friends at a local concert and we'd thought it'd be fun to have a contest to see who could get the most phone numbers. Now I'm not the best looking guy in the world but I was well known around the school, however, one of my friends is a very good looking guy. Anyways the games began and I somehow managed to get her number after no luck the rest of the night. She soon introduced me to her friends and with her help I managed to tie for first in the phone number contest! (8 numbers in total) Throughout the summer we began to text and pretty soon we were talking everyday through either fb messages or texts and as soon as school started we began to hang out with a group of mutual friends. By November, however, we began to get a lot closer and I found that she was telling me things before she told some of her other friends and vice versa. We soon would take drives or walks together to just talk about whatever was going on in our lives. Girls I might have an interest for guys she might have an interest for and this continued until about March when I realized that I was head over heels for her and I wanted little more than to date her, but from talking to her before I knew that she had problems with commitment and got scared when guys liked her so I hesitated and ended up going to prom with her. I was the prom king and I remember she thought it was so cool that her date was the prom king but I felt like she didn't enjoy herself that night as we barely danced and she was always running away with other friends. Because of that I felt kind of sad but we continued to be friends over the summer although I believe our friendship weakened.

"My husband (41) and I (30) are separated but on good terms. He is a veteran and was diagnosed with adult ADHD while he was in the military, but he's unmedicated. Now he's out in the civilian world and just scraping by financially and socially. 
 I didn't realize how bad things had gotten for him until last week when his car was reposessed. He recognizes that he's at fault and accepts full responsiblity (and, to his credit, he remedied the situation relatively quickly and got his car back), but I'm worried that he's not going to take the necessary steps (trading in his current SUV for a less expensive car, moving to a smaller home) to get his life back on track. 
 We separated for a variety of reasons, some of which are my own issues -- but his ADHD symptoms, including extreme financial irresponsibility, didn't help. I bugged him for years to see a professional, but I always got the ""Alright, I'll call someone tomorrow."" Eventually I stopped asking.

"First a little intro - sorry this post is going to be long. I'm a 25M living in the Midwest in a decent sized city. I'm looking for help understanding what my friend wants and is thinking. We first met in college when we were like 20/21 or so. We never really became that great of friends, just sort of had a class or two together and she was friends with the people I lived with for a while and I saw her on a semi-regular basis. I'm pretty shy and I definitely was attracted to her, so obviously I had a problem saying anything. After some time, I came to understand she also is pretty shy and that's why we never really talked a whole lot and made it past short conversations about nothing. 
 After college we didn't talk for a while (1-2 years?) until she started posting on my Facebook after seeing that I had moved close to her town and was at a concert of a band she liked very close by. She recommended that we hang out and get together, and we started to text. Things went really well for a while, we would text for about 2 months but didn't really ever get a chance to hang out because her busy work schedule and mine. She was very complimentary, and always told me how I was such a nice guy, so sweet, different from everyone else, etc. Eventually I decided to try and nail down some concrete plans to hang out, to watch the season/midseason finale of a show we both like together. Two days before the show we said yeah that'd be great lets meet up! I sent a text to see what the plan was, where we would meet up, and all of that the day before. No reply. Day of...same thing. No reply from her. So some time went by and I asked what happened with us talking, why she all of a sudden basically ignored me and dropped off the face of the planet. Nothing. So that was all of December and January and until about a week ago. 
 Just to make it clear, I didn't text her nonstop, I sent 3 unanswered texts including the one about our plans that she ditched and 1 Facebook chat. Nothing overboard or crazy because I was resigned that she flaked out and either didn't like me or just didn't want to talk anymore. Whatever. 
 So very recently, I saw her online on Facebook chat and decided to send her a message because I had just gotten a cat and I know she really likes them (And I had a few drinks in me). Bingo! She responded. She explained she had been going through a rough time, her ex-boyfriend (was an ex still when we were originally talking) and her tried to give it another go but he cheated on her so she ""blocked everyone out and didn't go out much."" She said she's still a bit in that phase but really trying to work and come out of it. She said she stopped talking to people in hopes that things with him would be able to go back to how they were before, but she caught him cheating on her again and he hasn't spoken to her in quite sometime now (over a month). She said she is really sorry she was an asshole and blocked me out, sorry she was selfish and put her relationship first, and that I didn't deserve that at all. She thanked me for being such a great friend when I told her that I honestly thought it was just something that I did and I didn't think I would hear from her again. She says shes getting over it, and trying to rediscover who is she and what she wants from life. 
 So we have been talking a bit now, but it's become kind of sporadic. She still tells me that I'm so sweet, a great person - all that stuff. She said she is really happy I messaged her again after all this time despite her ignoring me for so long, and she thought I hated her for blocking me out -saying a ton of nice things. I invited her to go to a concert later this month/early next month with me and she said she'd love to go if she doesn't have to work. 
 She did specifically say she isn't ready to be in the dating scene when I asked about how things were since her and the boyfriend broke up, sorta because I was curious if she had anyone else since then. She said no one's even shown interest. We talked about why I think she's a catch, and how I regretted not talking to her more in college, and she said she didn't think I really noticed her much back then and she would have loved to talk. BUT she's happy that I did now and it isn't too late to start talking. She mentioned how its weird to think how things could have been different then, and how different they can be in the future now. Direct quote from her is ""I have some healing to work through but when I get a little further along on my journey I'd really like to go out sometime"". I don't know what to make of this. I told her I'd definitely like to, and that I don't want to push her and I've been talking to her and trying so because I think she's a unique and special person - which she doesn't agree with at all. She thinks that I'm crazy to put up with her and to be willing to wait for her to be okay, because she isn't worth the wait in her opinion. 
 So since then we haven't talked much really. I did text her to ask if she was able to get work off for the concert and that I would really love to go with her, but I need to know by Sunday (yesterday) so I can find someone else if she isn't able to go. She didn't respond last night, but liked something on my Facebook. To be honest she is really terrible about responding and it's bothering me and confusing me. I don't overwhelm her with texts, if she doesn't answer my question I just let it sit. But it's tough to wait for an answer when she is on Facebook and stuff and I don't know why I'm getting no response. I really want things to work out with her, and I'm not really patient but I am really trying to wait. It would be much easier with better communication I guess. 
 A day or two without a text response is unheard of with most of my friends so I'm just not sure if I'm on the way to being ignored again, or if she's busy with her 2 jobs and not able to talk. Am I reading into this, or has she made it clear she does have feelings for me as more than a friend and is getting over someone now? Does anyone have suggestions about how I can proceed or what to do from here? I have wanted to have a chance with this girl for like 5 years now, and it seems insane that things might be coming together now. I just don't know what she is thinking, or what to do to put my mind at ease a bit while still respecting that she needs time. I did put forth last night as a deadline for the concert, but I didn't say anything to ask about it and haven't sent a text since Friday. I still have the ticket, still want to go with her, and would love to hang out even if she is working. Someone has mentioned calling her, but honestly that's a bit strange and might make things really awkward in my opinion at least. 
 I'm afraid of pushing and telling her that I'm not happy with her communication and having that make her think I'm a dick. Or pushing for answers and stuff to the point where she feels under pressure and just stops talking all together again - ending up that if I was more patient things would have worked out better. 
 Thanks guys, I'll respond and answer if you guys have questions to help me get the best advice.","Girl I have liked for 5 years recently got back in touch with me only to ignore me for a month before I initiated contact again.

"After several years of dating and several years of marriage, I left my wife this week. 
 I realized about a year and a half ago that I was in a very dismissive marriage.  Nothing I ever wanted or asked for was ever considered important, and it was basically just brushed off as a not gonna happen kind of thing.  I held back as long as I could thinking at first ""this is just marriage"" then thought, this doesn't feel right, I should try and get her attention, but nothing I said or did ever made a difference in how she handled my requests.  It became abundantly clear that this was going to be the rest of my life.  Even though I thought she was different, this really comes as no surprise as her parents operate the exact same way.  I basically turned into the shit on the bottom of her shoe...she made me feel LOW.  Like worthless.  Like how dare I even consider asking for something as simple as having her clean up after herself at the end of the day.  I don't even understand why I stayed as long as I did.  And I am too proud a man to stay in a relationship where I'm not happy.  We're both relatively young (30) and don't have kids, so I figured if I'm not happy, I should leave now. 
 I told her in February of this year that I wasn't happy in our marriage, and things got BAD.  bad bad bad (spite, arguments, crying, temporary separations, etc).  But then she decided she didn't want me to leave, so started making a lot of effort to do the things I asked her to do before I gave up.  She really has made a lot of effort to show me she's willing to make an effort. 
 The problem is it feels like it's too late.  We went and saw counselors separately, but could barely stand to be in the room together more than 5 minutes at a time, so never saw someone together.  I continued to ignore her feelings and attempts to talk and work through this because I wanted her to feel as bad as she made me feel.  I started seeing another woman (which my wife knows about) thinking it would alleviate some of my stress (which it doesn't, those of you considering).  I finally had enough of the pain and frustration.  So this past week I left.  I moved in with my friend and left my house and everything behind. 
 I feel like I made every effort to make things work with her and it wasn't until I literally had one foot out the door that she started paying attention.  Now I'm sitting here all alone at a friends apartment wondering if I should have given her the chance to go through counselling together.    I know she's told her family and our friends about the affair, so now I know even if I went back I would have that working against me for the rest of my life.  Despite that, I frankly don't give a shit about her families opinion as they have never really respected or accepted me, but I just don't feel like she will ever be the loving, compassionate, partner that I thought I was getting on our wedding day.  I don't feel well suited with her.  And I'm not convinced she's capable of making the changes I need to feel like I will be a true partner in life.  I don't know if I should make an effort to see someone together before I lose my chance as she was very up front that she either wanted me to work on things with her together or hurry up and end this.","left my wife this week, after years of trying to get through to her she finally started making efforts to compromise but I had already given up and don't have faith she can ever really meet me in the middle.",30,M,confession
"I have been dating my boyfriend for a little over a year (he's 23, I'm 24.) Overall, we have a very good relationship. We both love each other and we both think that we have a future (we'll vaguely talk about moving in together, being married, but we're in no rush). 
 My biggest complaint is that my boyfriend is never enthusiastic to hang out with me. I always initiate the hangouts. A lot of the time he'll say 'maybe' but then he'll agree later on. I sometimes feel like I'm forcing him to hang out with me. When we do hang out though, we always have fun and he's affectionate toward me. When we're not together, we're usually talking online for usually a couple hours everyday. 
 When I play hard to get, he is more aggressive about hanging out. Unfortunately, I don't have the patience to do this consistently. I have a very weird schedule (I tutor people in the evenings and weekends), so I need to plan in advance. He also lives almost an hour away, so I like to know ahead of time if I'll be making that trip at night (I live with my parents, so I go over to his apartment). I feel like at this stage in our relationship, I shouldn't have to play hard to get for him to want to see me. 
 Our relationship wasn't always like this. He graduated in May, and started a job immediately after. He also moved to a much more boring and smaller town. Since this change in his life, he's been noticeably less enthusiastic. He also doesn't really have many friends in the area, so I'm the only person he hangs out with (other than his family). On one hand, I think that he should be even more excited to see me, since his life is more boring now. 
 I am thinking there are either two things going on. 1) He's depressed with his new life and this is making him so apathetic about everything. 2) He doesn't love me anymore, but is too apathetic about changing anything. 
 To support option 1, we've been talking about moving to a large city over the summer. It seems like it is possible and I really want to do it. He seems into it too. 
 Anyway, has anyone been in a similar situation? Does anyone have advice for me?","BF is always unenthusiastic to hang out with me. When we are spending time together, he is enthusiastic though.",24,F,relationship_advice
"Just a little background: I'm a 25 year old guy dating a 23 year old, and we'll have been together for 6 years on May 29th.  She was 17 and I was 19 when we started dating, we were together for a year while she finished high school, then we immediately moved in together.  We've lived together for about 4 and a half years until financial situation forced us to move into my parents house.  A couple of months ago, she moved out into a friends house, and this is our first time living apart in years. 
 We got engaged about halfway into our relationship, but a few months and intense fighting ended that, unofficially.  Months after that, we were engaged again, until the move out, I decided to start college, and we put marriage plans on the back burner, much to her dismay. 
 From the very, very beginning she's been very,  very  clingy and very needy of my time and attention.  I've had a group of friends with whom I've been very close for years before I met my girlfriend, and little by little they fade away.  She will get into huge bouts of animosity with each one, and one by one, they all come up to me and say the same: ""Dude, I love you, but I can't do it anymore.""  Afterwards I really don't see much of them.  Thinking about it is really quite depressing.  Anytime I spend any amount of time away from her, she starts to freak out, blowing up my phone wondering where I am, throwing herself into a pit of depression because she can't handle not being around me...I guess.  We started to fight pretty much every single day while we were living together.  When we moved apart everything was getting much better, until recently, I get a huge guilt trip every night I decide to stay at home instead of with her, at her house. 
 It's been driving me fucking crazy, I feel like I've already lost my mind, and I don't know what to do.  I used to be a romantic, dreaming of having someone to love, who loves me in return to grow old with..and now I find myself denouncing the idea of love, and monogamy altogether.  I find it quite uncharacteristic of myself.  I've been having so many thoughts of other women and the idea of settling down and getting married is sounding more and more unappealing. 
 I love this girl, or else I wouldn't have molded my entire life around her, but it feels like I can never do enough.  She wants me to spend time with her, so I dedicate a few days to her: nothing but school and her.  Then afterwards when I try to go home and spend time with the family and feed my cat and do homework, my phone gets blown up about when I'm going to see her again, and if I'm coming over today and blah blah blah.  Nothing I do is enough. 
 I feel like she may have an imbalance she doesn't realize.  I feel like this isn't love she feels for me but an addiction.  It feels really unhealthy.  I used to feel okay about us, I loved her and I knew that and I wasn't going anywhere.  Her constant ""do you still love me,"" ""you're going to break up with me"" has driven me quite literally mad.  My entire way of thinking has changed because of her constantly fighting me even on things we agree on. 
 I'm so confused and I don't know what to do. 
 It's been six years, so I feel like it's gone too far to just break up with her...I'm afraid she might try to hurt herself.  Breaking up with her isn't even what I want to do.  I just want us to just...be.  I'm so tired of her making up problems out of no where, and constantly not getting along with my friends and family. 
 I'm so sorry for the huge rant.  I don't even get to keep journals to organize my thoughts because she snoops through everything. 
 Wow.  No one is going to read any of this.","My girlfriend of 6 years has spent that time driving away all my friends and family and tries to 'hoard' me to herself, driving me insane and herself out of my heart.

"I've known this guy for about two years. (I'm Female, 20. He's Male, 30). The main reason he doesn't know is because I actually couldn't tell him. He's my college tutor so I couldn't say anything as it would jepodize his career.

"Hey everyone, 
 So here's the deal.  I'm 24, in grad school for cinematography and I can't stop thinking about this girl (let's call her Elizabeth) who showed me the glorious ways of reddit when I was an avid Digg user (I can already hear all the boos).  I don't know what it is, but every time we are around each other, sparks fly and we have really great chemistry. 
 I met her my freshman year when one of my good friends was going out with her.  I've had a thing for her ever since.  I had been in other relationships since then, but basically in the last year and a half, I've really fallen for her. 
 We did have a fling for a bit (august, september 2009, went on a few dates and made woopy), and I have to say, it was always amazing to be with her.  however, at the time, I was obsessed with another girl (let's call her Hannah) and I thought that was going somewhere.  So I decided to end it with Elizabeth. Let me just say that right now, this has been the biggest regret I've ever had in my life. 
 It turns out that Hannah was just leading me on the whole time, and I ended it with Elizabeth for nothing (this was October 2009).  A few months later, Elizabeth and I met up at a bar with a few friends.  We were pretty friendly with each other the whole night. I was working up the courage to ask her out again, but at one point she got up to get a drink.  I waited for her to get back, however, she ended up meeting a guy while getting a drink, and since then they have gone out.  Not being forward enough this time around has been the second biggest regret of my life. 
 Elizabeth and I met up at a party a little while afterwards and I told her I really wanted to ask her out again at that bar, and she confessed to me that she wished I had done that too. 
 Since then I have tried to get over her by going out with other girls, but nothing seems to work.  I just keep getting more and more depressed, and I really hate this. 
 Back in december 2010, Elizabeth, a few friends and I went to a karaoke bar and had a fantastic night.  we came back to my place afterwards and played apples to apples until 3 in the morning.  during the night she drank a bit and was pretty flirty, but I didn't want to advance something she didn't want to get herself into.  we did play footsy for a bit under a blanket, however.  she crashed on my couch, and I had a tough time sleeping in my bed that night.  the next morning, we spent 2 hours catching up and shooting the shit, and when she had to leave, I walked her to her car.  At her car, I tried to kiss her, which was really dumb on my part.  she avoided and then i stupidly asked her how it was going with her bf.  she said it's up and down, but that she didn't want to get into something with me right now.  she apologized for being really flirty the night before.  I knew i shouldn't have done it, but it was just too tempting. 
 a week ago, i went to a friend's show at a bar and saw her there, but she was with another guy (not her bf), and I didn't really have the courage to go talk to her.  so I just pretended to be mr photographer and shoot photos for my friend's band.  later on in the evening, I saw her making out with that guy at the bar, and decided to leave as it was just too much for me to handle.  as far as if she's still with her bf, i'm guessing not, as she's not the type to cheat. 
 Last night, I had a dream where i was in some sort of library, and she walked in with her bf, saw me there, we confronted each other, and the bf had a nasty look on his face.  they left the room and I felt like crap, but then she returned alone, and we were together for the rest of the dream.  it was truly incredible, a dream where I really didn't want to wake up.  every time I did, i tried to go back to sleep to continue the dream.  it brought tears to my eyes when I finally woke up this morning. 
 so yeah, i dunno why I wrote all this out.  I just had to get it off my back.  thanks for reading it all.  I'm really not sure what to do.  again, i've tried dating other girls, but it always ends up that reason I'm dating them is because i'm trying to get my mind off of this girl.  She really means a lot to me, and I would do anything to get back with her, but I know that wallowing in my tears really going to do any good.  I'm even thinking of getting psychiatry help for this. 
 I know I probably sound like a total loser.  I just want you to know, well, I kind of am.  I know there's plenty of fish in the sea, but for me, it's a bit like that one that was [posted]( on reddit recently. 
 Does anyone have any advice?  Really willing to hear any and all advice.

"So, just to give some insight, I am not and never have been a witness. I was raised Catholic, confirmed, and stopped believing shortly after that. I consider myself an atheist at this point in my life. All of my knowledge of JWs has come from this subreddit, the sidebar links, and the limited explanations that the friend in question has provided me. 
 &nbsp; 
 In march of this year I became friends with this girl through a mutual friend, and she was  super cool! We had a lot of the same interests, she was a vegetarian, we could talk for hours about social issues, she's a feminist like me, and she seemed generally very open minded and worldly (the irony, ha!) as she had friends from Turkey, Israel, Vietnam, etc.; all places with differing religions. So, my initial thought was that she was an atheist, or at least wasn't really into any religion. I eventually found out she was homeschooled and thought that was strange, but sort of wrote it off as just a somewhat respectable decision her and her parents made (she came out seemingly intelligent, so they must've done something right, right?). 
 &nbsp; 
 I start to become pretty taken by her, and she, me, so we start hanging out more, and things eventually even get a little frisky, but that's where it all begins to fall apart for us (at least romantically). She ends up confessing to me how she's not happy and how she's been following the wrong ""path"" and that something in her life needs to change, and that can't involve being in a relationship. I decide that's cool, and considering this girl has a 5 year old kid and is only 22, I probably dodged a bullet with that, but I still wanted to be her friend because she didn't stop being cool or fun to hang with and could probably use a support system in her life. 
 &nbsp; 
 Some time passes, we still hang out from time to time, and all is generally good. One day I notice she has a bible study book on her kitchen table, not initially registering what the name ""Jehovah"" meant, but quickly finding out that she ""may"" be one when I asked her about it, explaining that she left for awhile but was considering going back in because she was ""lost."" This was a HUGE red flag to me, because all I knew up to that point was that JWs were against blood transfusions even if it meant the death of children, siblings, relatives, or friends, which I was definitely not cool with. It's one thing to refuse it yourself, but a whole other thing to encourage someone else not to, or to just outright decide for them. However, despite this revelation, there was nothing conclusive that she was actually involving herself with the church(?) again beyond just thinking about it, so at that time it was just a point of worry. 
 &nbsp; 
 Then fast forward to today, we get lunch and she, somewhat out of nowhere, tells me that she's been trying to get back in with the church for the last few months and what I thought of that, as she's apparently been going around to most of her close friends and asking them this. I was pretty taken aback, but basically told her my story of how I fell out of religion, and then attempted to confirm with her what I knew of JWs. I asked her about the 1915 Armageddon revelation first, as that seemed the most absurd and having to answer that first would hopefully knock some sense into her, but sadly her response was something like, ""Yeah...I'm not gonna say if that's entirely true, because you probably don't have the whole story, but I'll just have to go into detail about it another time."" When I told her that JWs don't believe in basically in every holiday because they have pagan origins, she agreed, and elaborated that they don't celebrate birthdays because every time it was mentioned in the bible someone died. When I tried to give a small insight into how science effectively filled my ""God hole"", in a sense, and I began to mention evolution she started to laugh and began to say how evolution is completely wrong, which I thought was kind of fucked up to say to me, but I just ignored it to keep the peace. She even tried to make the point of how other religions have child molestation issues, but not Jehovah's Witnesses! I never got a chance to really get to the meat of the conversation of why I think she should not go back, as I had to leave, but the conversation ended on a good note and we promised we would continue it at another time. 
 &nbsp; 
 Some background on her: 
 She got pregnant at 17, got married to the father at 19, got divorced at 21, and just recently took out a protection order on him for trying to choke her to death. What I learned today was that she didn't actually leave the church, but was kicked out for cheating on her husband before getting a divorce. I asked her if he was a witness, but she said he wasn't and that the church didn't have any issue with that (which does not seem to be the case for most people from what I've read). Her parents got divorced when she was a teenager. Her father is described as an ""alcoholic living in new york, probably"", and her mother remarried and is currently involved with the church. It's my inference that when she was kicked out of the church that her mother decided to not make contact with her for any other reason than to talk about her child/arrange to watch him occasionally. She son just started school this year, and she decided to send him to a public school instead of homeschooling, which still gives me some hope. The past 6 months or so she's had some financial trouble and issues with some sketchy landlords and had to move back in with her parents, I'm assuming under the conditions that she attends the gatherings and meetings with them. They even offered to pay for the downpayment and first month's rent on a new place for her, which I also assume was an attempt at bribing her. 
 &nbsp; 
 My main worry in all this, and why I'm writing this awfully written wall of text, is that she's getting herself and her kid into something that is outright insane. In every other aspect of her personality and life she seems very normal, if not just some kid who grew up too fast and is still rebelling, trying to fight the system, and live an alternative lifestyle, but when the JWs are factored into it, her reason and logical thinking goes out the window, as proven by our conversation today. I think she's clearly using the ""unconditional"" love offered to her by her parents, the promises offered to her by the church, and her attempt to get back in as the sole reasons for her new found stability and happiness in her life. 
 &nbsp; 
 What do I do? How do I help her see how crazy this religion is? I feel like I have an obligation to her as my friend to tell her this, but is it even my place to? I apologise for the word vomit, I don't usually write posts, especially as long as this. I just had to get it out and I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this and respond.

"Hey I'm male, 21, 6f 2 and around 224-230lb. 
 I have access to a decent gym and several pools. 
 I have a load of questions so bear with me, I'm very new to this whole Reddit posting rather than browsing. 
 Just a bit of background: 
 
 I swam competitively at a low level from the age 7 to 15. (Socially at University 19-Current) 
 Played rugby union from 12-18 20-current. 
 
 I have two goals: 
 
 To improve my rugby (position 2nd row/flanker/number 8). In 'American football' terms I would say an Outside line backer. 
 
 I managed to represent my country at the age of 15 (England Under 16s Rugby Union squad) however it was short lived for too many reasons and opinions to care. 
 Now I've seen two of my ex-rugby squad team mates make it to represent England 1st Team and many more play professionally teams its inspired me to take it back up again. For my position I could do with being as strong/heavy as possible (especially the legs/back however being mobile enough to get around the pitch). 
 Until now I've only ever done upper body weights wise at the gym, if anything I'm too addicted to benching due to me being an ex-swimmer so I feel confident and comfortable doing it. I'm nearly maxing at my body weight however I seem to be able to out rep anyone at a mid range level which again I think is down to swimming. I just need advice on how to improve my legs to last long enough for 80 minutes of a rugby game however to have the explosion power in line outs, scrums, rucks and mauls. 
 
 On a side note, my biceps seem to be fairly small compared to everything else. When doing curls I get cramp down the side of my hand easily. Is this due to a weak forearm? 
 
 
 To look better in general. 
 
 From half way up my torso upwards I think I look in good shape, it could look better but that's not my main problem. I seem to carry weights on my lower stomach (below my belly button) and around the sides (love handles?). Do I just need to burn fat in general to get rid of this? 
 DIETING: 
 I need some guidance on what diet to have to complete the above goals. I'm currently at University in my final year. Generally for breakfast I have porridge,  lunch I have bacon (3/4) & egg (3) and for dinner I have half a kg of meat (chicken/beef/gammon) with some kind of sauce (sometimes with 2 corn on the cobs). What should I be eating after exercise? Protein? Carbs? I've been recently advised to try 'For Goodness shakes' which are 3:1 Carbs to protein.

"Hi there, first time posting to one of these in like a year. Crazy. Quick background. I have grown up in a very small private school, have never been on a date (8th grade) and for the past 7 years of my life up until 8th grade, I have had a very sad social life to say the least. From about 4th to 7th grade, I indulged myself in video games more than I ever have in my life. (14, I know it sounds petty) I would play for about 10 hours a day. 
 I got seriously into call of duty. Being about 9-10 years old, You could say that my hand-eye coordination was not very good. Also, my maturity had not hit yet. One day my temper got so bad that I broke my MW3 disk and threw it at my father. Not even 60 seconds after I felt like a huge prick. I didn't play much for another year. (Side note: I might get off topic a lot, I really just want to get this off my chest for once) 
 Ok so near end of 6th grade. I asked out a girl. I did it fairly odd however. I guess I was friend zoned, as there was another guy there (brother). Playing games all day for the past few years. I just didn't make the right moves to show her my interest until it was too late. She found someone else. I was hurt, but I put on a face and moved along. 
 During 6th-7th grade, I had a toxic friend. I knew him for 9 years. He would be nice to me one second and then the next he would hate me. I could deal with the blatant disrespect. What I didn't like was the small comments, such as ""Ur too short"" or ""your too ugly"" Obviously said sarcastically and if in the right context would seem like a joke. This destroyed my confidence with girls for all of 7th grade (i fell it still has a toll on me now.) In 8th grade, my social group decided to cut ties with him after he left our school. 
 7th grade social life - I started 7th grade with some friends (6 or 7) and went in feeling like I was hot shit. I felt like not a person in the world hated me, because no one said it to my face. Little did i know back then of 7th graders. To fill you in. 7th graders gossip and talk behind your back. There was a point where I crashed. 75% of my grade just hated me. They shunned me for 4 weeks. My ""anxiety"" kicking in, I thought a lot about things. Nothing too dark, I was lightly depressed I would call it. I would walk into school, sit there like a zombie, go home, do homework (bright side, I ended 7th grade with a 4.0 gpa, which helped me this year get into some of the most prestigious schools in my city. This helped me a  Ton with my confidence. ) I decided to go back to the people I look down to (sounds worse than it actually was) I talked to kids I considered nerdy, introverts, etc. I became friends with my one old friend from 4th grade. A 6 foot tall, confidence machine it seemed. Looking back, he was just a follower, who deep down was just a self conscious and insecure as me. He brought me into his social group, and I started to become ""cool"" a word that is worthless to me now. I was never friends with girls, but felt good that I fit in. I felt bad often that I never had the confidence to make a move on a girl. 
 8th grade - Now in 8th grade, I decided to be evolved self, fucking awesome. I faked confidence until I had it. I became friends with girls, I had every friend I could ever imagine having. For the past 7 months, I can honest to god say that I have never been depressed once. Every day has been an incredible day since the start of 8th grade. Although my grades have been slipping, I got into a great school I cant wait to attend, so the grades dont rly bother me. I have had a couple girls who I am good friends with. And because of the past two years, I just can't make a move. Which is what I need help on. I hit puberty, and have been wanting a girlfriend for the past 3 months, and can't get myself to make a move, or ask anyone out. It's like a passive anxiety. I am happy 23.5 hours out of the day, but 30 minutes of every day tells me I could be doing better. I could care less about being popular with friends/boys, but the thought of rejection scares me to death with the tightness/smallness of my school. I can hold a conversation and make any girl laugh, but can't make any romantic or sexual (terrible word choice, honestly can't think of a better one though to be honest, don't take to seriously)","Had a rollercoaster of popularity ""lol"" Have no romantic skills. Happy, but need girl.

"My sister uses or takes my things without asking. I'm more tolerant of this sort of thing with my younger brothers because they're, well...  younger  -- but my sister is eighteen and will be going off to college in just a few months. It's a bit ridiculous that she's taking things from me without asking, particularly because she gets anything she wants at the drop of a hat. 
My sister has taken clothing from me in the past and claimed that it was hers. She's also taken an electric razor that I got as a Christmas present. It's irritating, but it seems that there is nothing I can do to stop her, so I have no choice but to let it slide. 
 Tonight I had no acne medication wipes to use to clean my face. She's been using them. She helps herself to anything of mine that she wants. I've resorted to hiding the majority of my belongings that would normally be kept in my medicine cabinet in my bedroom, so that I'll actually have them when I need them. She's too lazy to ask our mom to buy her the things she needs, so she uses my things until I don't have any. It's really frustrating. 
 I respect her boundaries. I can only think of one instance in which I took something of hers without asking, and I got in huge trouble for it. She even takes things that she and I are supposed to share, and puts them in her room so that I have to ask her to use them. If I were to go in her room and take something that we're supposed to share, she'd throw a fit and demand that I stay out of her room. If I ask her to give me the same respect -- not that I really care, but sort of as a matter of principle -- she'd tell me I was being too demanding.
I've talked to my mom about it, and she tells me that I'm being petty. But I guess since my sister is older than me (by two years), I have to respect her like an adult. It's irritating because she acts more childish than I do (and both our parents have acknowledged it)! 
 I guess I won't have to endure it much longer because, like I said, she's leaving for college in a few months, but in the meantime, is there anything I can do to stop her?","Annoying older sister takes my stuff and doesn't get in trouble, but if I did that I'd get in trouble.

"I've (f24) been seeing a man (m27) for almost two months and we haven't had the 'define the relationship' discussion yet. My ex and I dated from high school till last year so I have no real experience with the relationship talk because the ex and I just assumed from day 1. 
 With my new guy, we met online and then face to face in late June. Since then we've seen each other at least twice a week except for previously planned trips we both took. We talk almost everyday and when we're together he's very attentive and sweet. We even spent his birthday together and he said it was one of his best ever. I've tried dropping hints that I want to be his girlfriend, but it felt pretty juvenile and he either missed it or choose to ignore it. 
 I'm usually a pretty forthright person, but the one stop sign I have that's keeping me from asking is that he broke-up with his ex two months before we started dating after dating her long-distance for four years. Nervous that it hasn't been enough time and that if I bring up the conversation it will ruin what we have. 
 Should I bring up the discussion with him? Or just let things progress naturally? Or am I just being a nervous, anxious mess?

"Sorry, this is going to be a long rant/vent!!! 
 As an ACON, I understand how hurtful and damaging N's can be...in so many ways invisible to outsiders. 
 My niece, 27, is deeply damaged by her Nmom, like, deeply damaged.  Had gone NC with whole family for several years. 
 However, over the last year, she had let me get in touch with her and she's been getting so much better.  Went to detox and rehab and moved cities to get away from bad influences and to be closer to me. 
 I found her a place to stay with a friend who had helped several friends with their addictions in the past, found her a Methadone clinic and a sobriety specialist (psychiatrist) and arranged to make the payments, found a yoga class for her with a lady who has also helped people like her in the past.  I found her a church where they work with recovering addicts and teach them useful job skills.  My friend even got her a little dog-walking job to earn a little pocket money... 
 Well, her parents learn of all this and come into town (a 12-hour drive) 'to support her in her recovery'. 
 Her mother does not even talk to her at first, looks at her as if someone had put particularly foul smell under her nose.  Then, her parents take her out on the back deck and talk with her - next I see her running, saying she'll go change. 
 Her parents were telling her off for wearing black jeans and a black t-shirt.  Because her outfit was 'obviously calculated to provoke them, because they've told her many times they want her to wear brighter colours'. 
 Not good job on your recovery! 
 Not we are happy to see you! 
 No - follow our whims or we'll withhold our love!!!!!! 
 I lost it and told them that she's an adult and to treat her like one. It was only the one sentence, no insults, but I my face showed my rage at their behaviour. 
 Well, that exploded the situation. 
 My NSIL (niece's mom) starts screaming at me, that I have no idea what SHE'S been through in the last 6 months!!!  And storms out of the house. 
 Niece is not allowed to move into the prepared place, go to the yoga class, church, or take the dog walking job.  Her parents coerce her into committing criminal fraud to get the government to pay for her meds and doc right away (she would have had a 3 month waiting period, but would have been paid back eventually, so my hubby and I offered to front the money as we would get it back - but no, that was rejected). 
 She was so crushed! 
 Oh, and they put her into a homeless shelter, where people drink and openly shoot up drugs and where her deeply alcoholic cousin was already staying - the cousin has been trying to get my niece to go drinking with her.... 
 They said she was only allowed to talk to me if I apologized to my NSIL....so, of course, I swallowed my pride and anger and apologized. 
 That made it even worse! 
 Now, niece is under even stricter prohibition against contact with me in any way.  Plus they are (or so I hear) constantly interrogating her, whether I'm trying to contact her and so on... 
 Her parents gave her a phone that had a GPS tracker, so they know where she is, and that records all her texts and phone calls so they can monitor them. 
 The parents are back home, but call her constantly and get her mother's side of the family (also in  our town) to track her so that I cannot contact her.","my ACON niece is trying to get over alcohol and drug addiction and starts to succeed, so her Nmom and Edad are doing their best to sabotage her and have made her homeless.",27,F,raisedbynarcissists
"Yup.  Likewise.  I actually gave up on counting how many people I slept with.. NOT a fact I am proud of.  But I will say, I fucking love women.. of all shapes and sizes! 
 You're right, there can be no obvious indicators of agefor a girl 16-22, sometimes older.. I would assume younger, as young as 14 15, but I havent seen a girl that young nude since I was that age myself, which was over 10 years ago. 
 I do like young looking girls, though.  I would never, especially at my current age of 26, date a girl who was under ~20 ish at this point.. 
 But, to illustrate your point, about 3 years ago I met a beautiful girl at a bar (I had been checking her out all night, imagine my joy when her friend was an old friend of mine I hadn't seen in years, who immediately introduced us the moment we saw each other!)..  We talked, exchanged numbers, got together, hooked up and she spent the night.  Beautiful chick.. half Moroccan, kind of short, very curvy.. incredibly well dressed (think club hopping/always knows the dj/etc type.. which i am totally not into anymore at all)... Turns out she was SEVENTEEN!  We didn't continue talking after that. 
 I do love younger girls, though my cut off is ~18, as any younger (or younger looking) is a little weird.. makes me feel like a creep, lol.  Met my current girlfriend when was 18 (now 21), and I am now 26.  She is tall (about 5'10), and I thought she was closer to my age (21 easy), than her own.  She is also very womanly - 36DDs, wide hips, lots of curves.  Doesn't look like a young girl at all.  Also a REAL redhead with crazy long curly red hair and green eyes!  God, I am so lucky.   Truly, I do not deserve her.. But for some reason she has stuck around for over 2.5 years :P","personal experience with meeting a 17 year old in a bar (that does card at the door), being told she was 21, saw her nude, proves that there can be little to no physical difference between a 16/17 year old and a 21/23 year old girl.",26,M,RealGirls
"Hey reddit, first time poster. I hope I haven't broken protocol in my posting abilities. 
 I'm looking for a little bit of feedback. Excuse the rambling nature of this post, I'm not really sure which information is necessary. 
 -- 
 I am 20, she is 19. 
 So, was in a weird relationship status-wise with someone I was very into. We weren't official or exclusive; in fact we were both technically single the whole time. We would spend a very large amount of time together, mostly at her place (because she lived away from parents), watching tv shows, making out, talking etc etc. Thing were pretty laid back and very enjoyable. 
 The premise was that we were both free, thus any time we spent together was time we wanted to spend together. Being intimate with her was phenomenal too. I mean, mind blowing. We both really felt a huge connection too, wasn't just physical. 
 -- 
 Anyhow, things were going great, we got very close - to the point of 'love' and whatnot, which is very unusual for either of us. So things were going good, bonds deepening until she started to have a few doubts, started to see me more as a friend maybe? we were out to a club and I got very drunk, a little upset about the idea of splitting up I suppose? I can't really explain my actions, but her friend was there. She hadn't told her friend that we were seeing each other, so her friend sortof seduced me. I was roaring drunk at this stage, beyond rational or emotionally considerate thinking. I foolishly allowed myself to go along with the seduction and I ended up going to third base with her friend. 
 This warranted a break up - I realise that technically speaking i didn't do anything wrong (both single and all) but of course morally speaking I had crossed a very hurtful line. I felt incredibly guilty/terrible. I told her about it the next day. She says that she cares about me a lot but that this was too much. There was talk of perhaps trying again in a while. 
 -- 
 So two months later and we're not back together. I've been working on improving myself and ensuring I don't make the same mistakes twice. I've not forgiven myself for the mistake, and I went into overdrive mode in terms of being a good guy (double the amount of effort in terms of making dinners/massages/stuff that makes her feel nice). One night we slept together, and it was as incredible as the first time, but nothing more came from it. After another few weeks I confronted her on it, and she says 'i do care about you, I still have feelings for you, but it will never happen because of trust issues' 
 Now, I am still madly in love with her, naturally. The word 'never' is a hard one to accept. In honesty  I don't want to accept it, also I'm not really interested in being with anyone else. It'd sortof be her, or staying single for a while. I fear that I already know the answers to this post in honesty, 'move on', 'eliminate hope', but my question is - should I eliminate hope? is it possible that she is saying 'never' because it will make it easier for her to move on? 
 -- 
 Currently I'm not talking with her, giving her space. I'm focusing on fitness, college, and getting my hobbies/social life booming again. Should I approach her again in say, a month, for casual meet up and see how things go, or should I totally eliminate hope and just move on. Usually I'd do the latter, however I can't stress how strongly I feel for her. It's irrationally strong, and I'm generally a very rational person. Irrational things being strong enough to override reason are very significant to me. 
 Our bond was really deep, like incredibly so. In honesty, I think were it not for her prior trust problems, that we could've weathered the storm that I brought. buuut maybe I'm being too optimistic. Often at night I can't help but think of our closeness/being next to her/the wondrous sexual relations, it haunts me, then i might have a dream where we're back together. Gah, so annoying. 
 I do accept the guilt and remorse from the bad action that I've caused. I've relived every bad thing about it, and I've been quite depressed about how I lost control, and also about losing such a glorious connection. I've probably beating myself up too much but I don't want to talk about that element of things right now. 
 Anyhow, thanks for reading, reddit. Sorry for silly problems. I'm just finding it tough, and all of my friends say 'well, that's a tough situation'.

"Well, this is my first post on reddit but I've lurked for quite awhile (I know this isn't the best thing to say). 
 Anyway, I've been talking to this girl for a couple of months and about a month ago we've started hanging out quite often. We've hit it off great and we both really like each other. She's a wonderful girl beautiful, smart, classy; pretty much everything I've ever looked for in a girl. She feels the same towards me. We hang out a few time a week and there are no problems what so ever. 
 Here is where things get to be tough. A few months ago one of her parents passed away and it really has devastated her, which is completely normal. I asked her last week if she wanted to be my girlfriend which was a fail. She said ""she doesn't have everything she should be able to  give me"" and wants to keep things as is. I told her that's completely fine and that I understand and I was happy to keep things as is. I think she's afraid I'm trying to pick up her pieces and put her back together; which I replied ""I cannot do that it's not my place but I will be there to listen if you ever need to do that and that she really needs to find herself"". This was about two weeks ago and I thought it has past and we hung out since then. 
 Last night, we went out for dinner and after dinner I drove her home so she could sleep but we sat in my car and ended up talking. She brought it up again and said ""I should date other people because it would make her happy."" I replied I'm only interested in her and no one else.  I know she feels guilty about this and she was trying to scare me away by saying she's a bitchy girl like all the rest of them and doesn't understand why I like her but I know it's not the case because we were talking before the stuff with her family happened. This girl has a beautiful heart and is just an all around good person; this is the first girl that I've been seeing and get butterflies in my stomach when every we are about to hang out. I've spent years trying to find someone like this and she happens to be the one. 
 I am not going to bring up the relationship thing anymore and I'm not going to date any other people because I'm not interested. Is there anything I should do or can do for her? I feel like I may be just setting myself up for a long term failure but I've been hurt by everyone in my life and I feel like she's worth getting hurt over.

"Nah, you just shove that shit back into the closet and carry on. 
 Source: 
I was found clinically depressive at 17, but had been an avid self-harm freak since 13. I tried talking to my mother about it, but it turned into leverage when we fought. I was put on medication and sleeping pills for my insomnia after my parents decided I wasn't allowed to do any more sports/extracurricular activities until I agreed to see a psychiatrist. A few months later I ended up going through a tough breakup just before my 19th b-day and swallowed half the bottle of sleeping pills, was caught by my brother and his fiance, rushed to the hospital, given some nasty super mixture of stuff that made everything come out both ends, put on 24 hour watch, and then released since it was a ""mistake"" (You can fool ER people easily). I went to work, 'cause, if you make money, that means mo' bread, and finished a full shift. 
 When I got home all of my clothes and expensive items were on the front lawn, and my mother met me at the door and told me they didn't want to handle any more of my shit, they had their own problems and I was old enough to figure out my own. I called my sister and her husband, they said I could crash in their unfinished basement for a few months. Did so, celebrated my b-day alone there, ended up moving in with a gay guy whom I was friends with. He had a ton of sympathy for my situation (he also was going through a rough breakup). I stayed there for about eight months before the cost of the house that we were renting ran me dry. This whole time I went without medication because I was a broke-ass-sexual-chocolate. 
 I then moved to section 8 apartments, my ex just so happened to be living in as well (I'm not a smart cookie!). The weirdest part was that she lived in the same building on the opposite side. 
 I live there alone... I want to emphasize that I was ALONE. 
 That means no friends, no family, nothing but work and school. My ex would occasionally visit, complain about her abusive BF, and let me watch her kid for a while. I would take her daughter to the parks, and out swimming, or we would play and watch her favorite TV shows. It was rather therapeutic to be a part-time father. Sorry, I didn't mention that before, I was dating a chick with a kid. We were friends all through the pregnancy, after she had a little girl, we kinda just stuck together. Then ""baby-daddy"" came stroll'n back in, literally, two days before the break-up he just walks in her door (I'm on the couch in my boxers after putting her child to bed) and they lock themselves in the bathroom to discuss my presence. I gave her space after that and whilst waiting for her arrival at her apartment on night, she pulls up in her care with him in the passenger seat. One car, eleven at night (I'm a creep...), and his car wasn't there. I'm a mathematician so it took milliseconds to figure that shit out. She had been trying to juggle us both for the last four months, bad choice, I'm a HS kid . . . I was fragile and broke.
Anywho, back to the main story, this whole time other things happening in my family's life pushed a wedge further between us. It got to the point I wasn't ever invited over, not for Thanksgiving, not for Christmas, or b-days, NOTHING...I would occasionally drink myself into a stupor, smoke ridiculous amounts marijuana, or self harm again I continued to go to school, even though my grades were plummeting and financial aid kept threatening to cut me off, forcing me to write letters every semester explaining why I deserved to be given that chance and I guess everything fell into perspective as the vice tightened. I started to find friends in the lowest places, since they were as fucked up as I was or worse. I'd stay at my local waffle house till 7am some nights and on my days off I would get in my car and drive around the state, sometimes sleeping in my car in a new town. 
 SUICIDAL THOUGHTS DON'T GO AWAY! 
 I found better logic to stay alive than to cop-out, each time that it entered my head. Most of it revolved around hate and revenge as I dehumanized everyone around me, but it slowly turned into a want to show that I was better than it. 
 Fast forward, I am graduating in two weeks with a BS, majoring in Computer Science and Mathematical Theory. I haven't dated or even tried to since my last ex, we no longer are in contact, but that's another story for another time since I seemed to have written more than I intended. 
 Different things work for different people. Mine isn't exactly the right way, but I haven't self-harmed in over three years. I stopped smoking and drink heavily, so my health has been looking up.

"Hey seddit i'm going to be 33 any day now and i need advice on the age of women i should/could be targeting. basically i live in a thriving university town and there are girls of all ages but they skew towards younger, like 18 - 23ish. of course there are other sides of town where they likely skew upper 20s lower 30s. but i work and live near the university so that's where i'm around every day. 
 when it comes to physical attraction, age doesn't really matter to me and i'd be fine with any age for a physical encounter. if i wanted to have more than just a night thing, i'd probably prefer someone 23 or older, basically a girl who's not an undergrad (although if i clicked with one i'm not opposed to it).

I was relatively strong in the four big lifts, especially squats...however my bench press was always terrible. Lifting almost constantly throughout High School, my squat broke the 600 pound mark, my press was over 250, yet my bench never could get past 210 or so. (Currently it's capped out at the same spot, and I weigh 230 with about 23% bf) 
 I played some JuCo football after high school so I kept lifting, and nothing improved, after that I didn't touch any weights until about a year and a half ago. (I am 31 now.) My lifts are coming along...except for that bloody bench press. 
 A very experienced friend of mine suggested using dumbbells only for a while and seeing if that helps. I thought that this was the ticket, as I started with 50's and over the course of the last six months or so have worked my way up to pushing 80's. However, when I jumped back over to the barbell absolutely nothing had improved. 
This has always been a huge point of frustration, I was strong enough at one point in time that I could have lifted competitively, if not for this gaping hole in my abilities. To me, it makes no sense... I can put up decent numbers with fly's, overhead press, etc. 
 One thing I wonder if it's connected, I'm also awful at pulldowns/pullups. I don't know if there could be something tying those together or not? I hope the gurus on here might be able to show me some insight, I've lurked for a little while and this is my first post. Thank you folks.","Could have competed in lifting except my bench press has always inexplicably been awful, looking for advice. 
 Edit: Gonna work on getting a camera to do a form check.  Thank you all so far for the insight.

"I can't speak for other atheists, but your situation is pretty close to where I was about 5 years ago.  I was raised catholic and was extremely devout throughout my teens and early twenties.  From the ages of 17-19 after confirmation, I served on a youth advisory council in my diocese which acted as advisers to our bishop on issues related to youth in our diocese. 
 My deconversion to atheism happened over ~10 years beginning from age 20-21.  I am currently strong atheist, borderline anti-theist and have 'identified' as such for the last 3-4 years, although there are still a few people I haven't outright told about my atheism- mostly because it's not something often brought up.  My deconversion started shortly after my experience on the youth council.  I have no horror story that coincides with my deconversion, the process started from a want to have a deeper understanding of the bible.  I read the bible cover to cover over the course of 18 months, and by the end, I wondered how anyone could believe it to be divinely inspired.  The Holy Bible is essentially a bunch of gibberish, and it's no wonder there are thousands of religious denominations that exist due to the different interpretations.  What solidified my deconversion was the beginning of my (second) college career six years ago.  I am currently working on a PhD in Physics Education Research.  I couldn't reconcile the disconnect between the gibberish in the bible with my now deep understanding of the scientific method and the quality of evidence required in my field.  essentially, the more sure you are about something, the better your evidence should be.  This is the opposite with religion, which requires more faith, and not evidence regarding the magnitude of claims made. 
 I'm getting long winded here, but here's how I view life now as an atheist: once I shed the burden of religious belief, I found I was free to live my life, without a lot of difference overall.  I mourned my faith for a couple years, and I guess you could call this my 'existential crisis'.  One thing that vastly changed for me is how I regard other people.  If this is the only life we get and recognize it as such, then you tend to value your experiences with those close to you.  I take people for granted much, much less than I did before.  I'm also a lot more honest with people now than I ever was when I was devout. I was essentially a compulsive liar when I was a devout catholic, because all I had to do was confess my sins and be forgiven.  I found that lying constantly was a huge burden to carry and an extraordinary waste of time.","I started out like you and now that I have freed myself from the slavery of religion, my life is better in pretty much every possible way.  Since I can relate as an ex-catholic, feel free to ask me anything you want to know.  PM me if you don't feel comfortable asking here in 'public'.",28,M,DebateReligion
"Hello, my name is Raven, and I am 18 years old. I currently live with my mother and stepfather. 
 My mother is an alcoholic, has been previously physically abusive, and is emotionally and mentally manipulative and abusive. When I moved out the first time, she used my mental instabilities to get me to move back home. She currently has me paying an exorbitant amount of money to stay in her home, in a literal storage room, half of which has no roof over it. In addition to my “rent”, she often decides to ask me for money, and threaten to kick me out if i do not or cannot pay it. She has also threatened to kick me out for legitimately being sick and calling into work. She often screams and manipulates me during breakdowns, sending me out into the streets for a night. 
 My stepdad is also abusive, and guilts me for my mental illnesses, undermines my body image, and criticizes all relationships I have, including friendships. 
 I have been shut down many times when bringing up the topic of moving out, often resulting in them taking money from me to ensure that I cannot leave. I have been depressed and suicidal for many years in this home, and I cannot believe that I am back, and stuck again. 
 I currently work a minimum wage job 40 hours a week, and do not attend school. 
 My partner of 6 months will be moving out of her apartment at the end of the year.  After some discussion, we have decided that moving in together would be the best course of action. We have a place in mind, and a plan for when to move. However, I have very little money or opportunity to save, and she and I will be living across the country from my current place. 
 I need money for the move itself, as well as any deposits that need to be made, food, clothing, first few months of rent, and any furniture I may need, as I have very few belongings. (food and clothing are minimally available at home as it is.) 
 I have set up a gofundme donations fund for this purpose. I will also be donating money to this fund where I can, as to boost your confidence in me, as well as make that money inaccessible to my parents, who currently have access to my checking account. This will not be an all-or-nothing campaign, so I have set the goal to a higher amount. However, all donations will be used to help me get out of this place.

"Pre-post warning: Like Patrick Roy, this text could be described as a wall. You've been warned! 
 
 As some of you probably know from previous posts, I was out for the winter season thanks to a jerk running a red light and smashing up my car. Well, this week was my triumphant return. The doctor cleared me for physical activity, so I broke out the inlines on Monday to try and get my legs back, then off to the first game of spring league on Wednesday. 
 Our spring league is co-ed, and there's two divisions: competitive and rec. Because I didn't have a team, I was slotted into a misfits team in the rec division. It was a bit of a shock going around the room and asking people what their hockey experience was. Lots of first season people, a girl who had only played ringette, guys who had never played anything more than road hockey. Then we got to me; 22 years of experience, lots in AAA. 
 When game time rolled around, I was pretty worried about being  that guy  who's head and shoulders above everyone. Luckily there were a few rules in place that set the tone. Every 4th goal has to be scored by a girl, preventing guys from running away with the game. 2 girls on the ice at all times to make sure they get ice time. No slapshots. No body contact at all. 
 I slotted into the left D spot on the opening faceoff, which our centreman (the only other experienced player on the team) won cleanly back to me. I picked up the pick, took a stride backwards and had more time than I've ever had in my life to make a pass; everyone was sort of...  stumbling  at me rather than skating. I picked the right winger, put it right on the tape... and knocked the stick straight out of her hands! 
 It was pretty hilarious, I apologized and slowed my game right down. I didn't end up with a shot on goal, instead focusing on getting my legs back and making perfect passes. The game was an absolute blast, it's the kind of league where you let a weak player have a shot if they manage to get in position with puck control. Our goalie stopped a pretty amazing 36 shots while our team managed to hit the net around 20 times. 
 We ended up tied 4-4 at the end of the game, which was miraculous. It went to a Female-Male alternating shootout for the game decision. Our first shooter missed, theirs scored. As much as I protested that shootouts are awful and wanted nothing to do with it, my team all but pushed me out the door to take the first guy shot. I skated in with good speed from the right wing, faked the shot and walked around the sprawling goalie and slid the puck into the wide open net. At least... that was the plan. Speed was good. Fake was  great  and the goalie bit hard. The problem was this 40-something goalie channeled his inner Dominic Hasek, reached over his head with his stick across the goal line and stopped me dead. If I wasn't so cocky I would have at least raised the shot, but he made me the victim of my own hubris. 
 The goalies stopped the remaining shots, so we ended up losing. Nobody seemed to care though, we were all sore and happy from an awesome game. I bought the goalie who stoned me a beer afterward (guys from both teams shared a room, girls from both teams shared another) and we had a good laugh about the shot attempt. He said it made his night, so I was pretty happy to hear that. The beauty of this league is that wins and losses aren't tracked. There's no kept stats, just people who show up to play hockey and drink a few beers. 
 It's definitely not what I'm used to, and far from what I expected, but I couldn't be happier to be playing again. I think this bottom-tier hockey might be some of the most fun I've ever had.","Fought Wayne Gretzky, told him to make me a sandwich.",22,M,hockeyplayers
"Okay so this is going to be a bit of a long one, but I could really use some impartial advice -- I'm going to be brutally honesty and I hope you will to. 
 First some background information. I'm 21(m), she is 21(f). We were each others first big relationship, we were together for four years and had an amazing time. Basically we fell madly in love with each other. After a month I came on too strong and scared her off; however, four months later I found another girl and she basically opened up about how she made a mistaking running away from us and we got back together and had one hell of a blast. Anyway, our last year together was bad. We fought a lot, mostly because I was too busy and couldn't give her the attention she need. Also At the time I wasn't sure if I still wanted to be with her so I was definitely half-assing our relationship -- a fact that I have come to regret. 
 So during summer break we were separated by three hours of driving. When we saw each other we fought and we fought over Skype. It was a bad situation. Fast forward to the end of summer. A few weeks before school started she came up to visit me and we had the ""talk"". She said she was confused about what she wanted and wanted to take a break. I told her a break not a good idea because they only end badly, then I suggested breaking up and she was totally against that idea. We ended our time together that weekend as a couple taking it day by day. But a few days later she called saying we needed to talk. She said she needed space and time and thought that we needed it. I said I'm not taking a break so we came to the conclusion that we were going to break up. 
 A week after no contact I called her to figure out if we were really finished and she said yes. So I naturally I was crushed. For the next month we had no contact until I saw her at a bar sitting with an old fling from high school, they were alone. Naturally I flipped out, headed to the bar, put my credit card on tab, ordered four shots of tequila, and looked for the most attractive girl in the bar. This was a bad idea. After a while I realizes she was there with several other friends, but I had already started the process of making her jealous by lavishing this extremely sexy lady with drunken attention. Several hours later, and several several shots later, a mutual friend informs me that she is leaving the bar because she saw me kiss the sexy lady (a part of the night I don't remember). The Friend tells me to run after her and I do. This ended with a drunken goodbye. Me asking who I kissed and her telling me that she will always love me. 
 The next day I get a text from her asking if we could met up and talk because we couldn't leave things the way we did that night. I agree and a time is set for that day. We meet up and have a good talk about our relationship. We both disclose that we had been seeing other people. But she had fooled around with the guy she was seeing for two weeks. I had just been hanging out with a different girl. It was a crushing blow but she realized she didn't want to lose me so we got back together that night, each of us breaking it off with the other person. 
 We spent four amazing days back together but on the fifth day she said we needed to talk. She told me she was really confused about what she wanted: she still loves me but couldn't get the other guy out of her head. I told her to leave and figure out what she wanted. took a day and told me to call her. I did and she said she hadn't made a decision. She said she still loves me but was really confused (because she couldn't get the other guy out of her head -- I called him her rebound but she didn't think he was) and needed time and space to think about it; however, she did not want to go back to no contact. I agreed and went to bed. 
 The next day we chatted over the internet. I asked her if the other guy wanted her back would she go to him and she replied with ""honestly I don't know I'd have to think about it"". Since that conversation its been two days and neither of us had spoken a word to each other. All I want to do is message her but I'm afraid I'll fuck it up for good if I don't give her the space she wants. 
 All I want is some advice and direction. Like I said above, please be brutally honest because nobody has given me that yet.","Dated a girl for 4 years, we broke up, got back together, she wants space because she doesn't know what she wants.",21,M,relationship_advice
"Hello everyone, 
 In September of 2012 I decided to start a ketogenic diet to help facilitate a better lifestyle and a happier, healthier me. After almost three years of eating a strict ketogenic diet, lifting weights and at times; for more than a year, not cheating at all. I have decided to transition back to a normal diet to try and lose the last bit of weight that I want. 
 The reason being is that while yes the diet is effective and is in my opinion much healthier than a standard western diet, it is not perfect. Keto is at its core the best method for weight loss I have found. It will give someone near immediate motivation to continue the diet in the form of a lower number on the scale within the first week. A few months in and some possible bouts of weak and tiredness you will start to feel endowed with super strength and clear mindedness. You can run longer, lift harder and have the mental determination to keep doing all of those things as the diet is working. 
 However; in my case it began to change my state of mind. Since last year I have started to become frustrated with keto. Having lost 120lbs and hitting three weight loss goals I thought that I would have looked differently. Going from having atrophy in muscles to now having a defined upper and lower body I still thought that I would have looked differently. I have become depressed because of how I look still. 
 Keto is not a magical cure all for your problems. The body dimorphism, depression and or self deprecation that you have at 300lbs isn't guaranteed to leave when you're at 200lbs. You have to be comfortable with yourself and inside and outside. It's not all pizzas and candy at the end of the rainbow. You have to maintain the weight that you get to, you can't go back to the same poor eating habits you had that made you overweight in the first place. It has to be in moderation if you go back to normal food unless you train the Rock for six hours a day. 
 A few weeks ago I was so depressed that I nearly committed suicide. I am tired of watching my friends be happy and jovial eating normal food and still being in shape. I was upset at the sight of happy couples because I'm still having trouble finding a girlfriend after taking a few years off to work on how I looked thinking that was the issue. It was not, it was that I had become so miserable and self loathed while on keto for not being turned into a six pack laden model like you may see in this subreddit that I had become dissociative to why I started the diet in the first place. I told myself, go eat a fucking candy bar and be happy; and that was it. I ate fruit and regular food and immediately started to feel like myself again. 
 You can only eat in so much of a deficit for so long before your brain starts to snap I guess. Take care of yourself, be aware of potential behavioral changes in yourself and if you feel like you're going to harm yourself talk to someone. If you've lost enough weight to counteract the sudden increase in water weight back on the scale you've still lost weight and are in a better position than you were before. 
 Seeing the video about Matt Diaz that made its rounds on the internet and needing skin removal surgery and the sudden change to eating regular food prompted me to find out exactly how overweight I am still. A week later I had a dexa scan done and met with a plastic surgeon to discuss having liposuction done to remove the stubborn pooch of belly fat that I just could not seem to lose after the last year of hitting my last goal weight. This is where I discovered that apparently I had done an amazing job at losing weight. 
 The dexa scan results told me that I have around %13 body fat. That couldn't be right? I have a big stomach that hangs in front of me, I have fat I can grab on my thighs and man boobs I can pull as far away from my chest as I can my stomach. Skin she tells me, loose skin that has no where to go yet. She pulled out binders of patients she has seen and they looked similar if not exactly similar to me for some of them. The big stomach I can pickup and extend six inches away from my body is still some fat but it is primarily skin. This is where she destroys me, she says that without an abdominoplasty (specifically a fluer de luer abdominoplasty) I will never look the way I want to look. It makes all of the dieting not worth it almost immediately in my brain until I remember that it wasn't only for looks. It was to be healthier and live longer, to be able to walk up stairs without being winded, to not be that fat guy. 
 I had a second and a third opinion to make sure this information is accurate and it seems to be. This is just a myriad of things that I have experienced while doing keto and I wanted to post in somewhere specific to other people who may have the same problems or concerns. 
 Here is an example of progress photos over the years for how I used to look versus now.","Was fat and happy, lost weight and became miserable, keto made me depressed almost committed suicide, carbs make me feel better, you may not look how you want to look after significant weight loss and that's okay because you're healthier.

"So...me (26F) and my girlfriend (36F). Been together for about eight months. Also, please excuse any spelling, grammar, etc. mistakes. I'm writing on my phone and I've also been dealing with really bad insomnia for the past two weeks. 
 My girlfriend recently suffered a horrible tragedy. Her oldest and best friend died unexpectedly. She was literally here one minute and then gone the next. And my girlfriend won't be able to make it to the funeral, because it's happening in another country and it will literally cost thousands of dollars for her to fly there. She's completely devastated. It's so heartbreaking, it makes me cry if I sit and think about it for too long. 
 Unfortunately, the last few weeks for me have been really difficult. It's not as bad as losing my best friend, it's a lot of financial and health related stuff, but it's enough to make my insomnia kick in something terrible. 
 My girlfriend and I are supposed to hang out tonight and as awful as this sounds, I just don't think I have it in me to see her. I want to be a good girlfriend to her and take care of her and listen to her and hold her if she needs to cry, but I'm honestly worried I'll be so cranky and exhausted and stressed out I'll just make everything worse for her. 
 Should I see her tonight anyway? Should I try to bury all this stuff and do my best to put on a happy face? Should I be honest with her and say I'm feeling so emotionally and physically exhausted that I'm worried I'll just make her even more miserable, and maybe we should hang out another time? But what if she really needs me and thinks I just don't want to deal with her? Or should I tell her how stressed out I am, but we can hang out anyway, just keep in mind I might not be in the best mood? But she's the type who is always so worried about being a burden, and I'm concerned she'll say, ""No, it's OK, we don't have to hang out!"" even though she doesn't mean it. 
 I realize I'm probably overthinking this. Sorry. It's hard to make decisions when you're running on hardly any sleep.","My girlfriend is really upset and sad and I'm really upset and sad and I'm worried that if we see each other tonight I'll make her super upset and sad, but I'm worried if I DON'T see her, I'll STILL make her super upset and sad.

"I have smoked weed roughly three to four times a day, every day, for nine years. I've been to numerous interviews ""high"" and work every day ""high"". I am a dad of a great two year old boy, his mother supports my decision to smoke(though would obviously prefer I didn't risk my freedoms for an illegal substance). I like to write music and stories (I DM/GM) and I spend countless hours with my son helping him grow. It would seem that this person is a normal, if not boring, lower middle class working man. 
 However, nine years ago I was a different person. I had bouts of insomnia, often going days in junior high without sleeping. Manic Depression, social anxiety and panic attacks were the determining factor in my life's happiness. I weighed 115lbs at 5'8"" until I was 18, unable to eat based on the fear that I would become overweight like the rest of my family and endlessly ridiculed for it. Hunger is not an emotion I understand to this day because of that shame. Most of my peers made me uneasy even in my youngest years. I knew this wasn't who I wanted to be. 
 This all culminated in my college years as I was forced to attend therapy after a serious suicide attempt. A man in Cape Cod, MA I had seen for years before asked me on my return why I was back. I said I needed help and I couldn't control my emotions as I matured. What was once simple become complex and I was losing grip. He gave me pills. I feel like it was 18 months I lost of my life in the blur of these ""medicines"". After I tried a few, I asked him to take me off them. Only wanting a solution, I asked if there was anything else I could do. We talked about programs and more therapy and I tried to just BE better. One time, in passing, the man from the Cape told me I could smoke a joint and see what I think. My D.A.R.E. Training brushed past it, my Hot Topic sXe shirt laughed at him. To this day, I've thought of that moment a thousand times. A moment so insignificant in the grand scheme has changed my life. 
 Marijuana is often abused, and I won't say that I can't or don't find enjoyment in it. For me though, it has shown me a way to look at things differently. Recently, I've started smoking less and less daily. I finally feel in control and at peace with myself. Sure some nights are tougher than others, but I get to be myself.

"Oops, that tile was supposed to be 36+1.  I should really wear my glasses. 
 So, I graduated a whole month early (I am so, so sorry /u/RayningAcid/). My labor could have gone very, very badly - it was a real testament to how good medical professionals can really make or break a bad situation. 
 I woke up at 3:45am that morning to broken water.  I didn't believe that was what had happened at first, but when it started gushing down my legs I couldn't really say it was just pee.  I went in to L&D, still riding the denial train and expecting to be sent home.  Nope - Amnisure was positive.  I was having my little lady that day, whether she liked it or not.  At that point, I was 3cm, 70% effaced at -1 station.  They let me labor for about 3 hours with no real progress (my contractions were staying at 5min apart), so it was suggested that they start the pitocin.  No problem for me, I am a 'better living through chemistry' type of person. 
 My contractions got closer together and godawfully painful so sometime in the early afternoon I asked for the epidural.  My SO, for some reason, freaked out about the needle in my back and almost passed out while they were placing it, hah.  I was still not progressing as much as they'd have liked, so they were regularly turning up my pit dose until I was up to 14 and the contractions were almost on top of each ohter - even with the epidural, that was AWFUL.  They turned it back down to 12 and let me continue to labor... I'd say I went into active, omg I'm going to die from contractions, labor about 6-7pm.  The only thing I really remember was thinking, I will make it through this because I have no other choice.  And my SO holding my hair through each contraction.  He was amazing, and I love him forever. 
 Sometime about 9pm or so I remember the nurse doing a cervical check and telling me that I was dilating unevenly.  This is actually a thing?  Apparently, it is (I later asked about this, it happens if the babies head is turned and not applying even pressure over the entire cervix, or if you've had any sort of cervical trauma and have scar tissue.  they suspected it was both for me since I'd had a D&C in my 20s).  One side was fully dilated, and the other was still at about 7cm.  My body was telling me PUSH but with that lip there I was banging her head against my cervix (she had a pretty large bruise on her head, I felt so guilty).  Ladies (and the scant few gentleman who brave this forum), I'd like to tell you - getting a cervical check during a contraction is not the most pleasant experience I've ever had.  At some point, the nurse was actually massaging my cervix, trying to get it to open up so I could push.  My cervix, like the rest of me, was a stubborn bitch and didn't want to give it up. 
 Eventually we got to the pushing part, about 10pm.  Here's where it gets fun - I remember he telling me to PUSH AS HARD AS YOU CAN, while grabbing the back of your knees.  I pushed so hard my face turned red and my lips were tingling, and I was SO GODDAMNED TIRED at that point, but the nurse kept egging me on and it kind of pissed me off so I was pushing at that point just to make her shut up.  Once she started descending, my OB came in to finish the job. 
 I had normally been pushing with each contraction, but at that point the nurse got very serious and was telling me to push without them.  What I didn't realise is that she started to crown, but she was turned facing somewhat sideways and her shoulder was stuck under my pubic bone (shoulder dystocia).  The OB made three incisions (median episiotomies) in order to give her more room and to turn her as I pushed to help move her.  She was still not moving, and it was getting to the dangerous oxygen deprivation mark, so as a last ditch to not have an emergency C-section another nurse came in and pushed on her shoulder to 'pop' her out from under my pubic bone.  Thank goodness, that worked.  Out she came!  I remember the feeling of my entire pelvic girdle stretching as she move out... it was a lot like being severely constipated and getting sudden relief.  I didn't get immediate skin to skin because she was blue when she came out (her initial Apgar was 5), I think oxygen might have been involved; so I just laid there in a complete daze while the doctor sewed me up (and he did a marvelous job!). 
 River Elise was born at 11:13pm on 6/28, she was 6lb 4oz and 19"" - my OB has already told me if I plan on having another, I'll probably want to do a c-section as I'm not really wide enough to give birth vaginally to a full term baby (this is, apparently, due to me being a person of short stature - we shorties have a higher chance of having issues giving birth vaginally).  We do not plan on having another (lol).   She developed jaundive and had to be kept under the bililights for an extra night, plus her blood sugar and temperature wouldn't regulate at first (we did lots of skin to skin after the initial exam), and the first night home with her by ourselves I don't think either one of us got any sleep what for checking her to make sure she was still breathing, but she's 2 weeks old now and I couldn't love her any more.

"Hey guys, I made this throw away acct specifically so I could have this conversation. I'm a 25 (M) and I really, really care about a 25 (F). This girl stole my heart. She's fun, caring, inspiring, she makes beautiful art and has so much passion about her convictions that I feel warm just being around her. She's veeeeery introverted though and this is something I've never really experienced. I'm a very social outgoing person, I text the people I care about quite a bit and I can appreciate that's not how it's going to work with her (I guess I'm ENFP if that means anything). 
 She agreed to come with me as my date to a wedding, and late after the reception we had a really romantic moment where I grabbed her and we kissed (in a fountain. It was amazing). Ever since then though she's responding less and less to me. I was ready to accept the fact that it wouldn't work out and try to move on but our mutual friend said that she told him about the night and said it was great. She told him it was really romantic, a good kiss, and I was super respectful afterwords. But she still won't respond to my texts and has been hanging out with me less and less since. So I'm lost and any thoughts or advice would be amazingly helpful.

"It's the end of the year. 2015 was the biggest setback for me academically, socially, and personally. In the last four month I struggled to direct my life toward where I want to be. I can say that I managed to get back on my feet. I want to apologize about my grammar in advance, English is my third language. I try my best, but let me know if something bothers you a lot. 
 Things started going bad in November-December 2014. I struggled with school. I tried too hard to socialize and do well academically at the same time. I failed at prioritizing. My grades dropped low, and I was on academic warning. No big deal, I thought. Spring came by. That's the period where I had to find a co-op job. At that point, I didn't have any relevant experience and my GPA was very low. Did I mentioned I cannot drive? I applied to over a hundred job applications and had around thirty interviews. Since I still received interviews, my resume was not too bad. I knew that without a licence I had very little chance to receive an offer in my city. As I apply to more job postings, the more interview I attended, the more my confidence diminishes. This created a downward spiral. Eventually I was unemployed throughout the entire summer. 
 You might ask, how is this related to my narcissistic mother? Let me built up my story. So during the four month of summer, I had my second major depressive episode. Since it is not the first time I had a depressive episode, I knew exactly the symptoms of my depression. 
 
 I couldn’t get out of bed.  
 I didn't want to meet up with any of my friends. My friends are concerned about me, and they are amazing people, but I felt too shameful to see them.  
 I couldn’t control what I put in my mouth.  
 Excessive porn use.  
 Very low self-worth.  
 
 It was the worst four months I ever experienced. I was very aware that I was depressed, but I feel so hopeless. If you have depression, you have my full empathy. I don't have any magic motivational speech, but you just have to keep fighting the monster in your mind. Because it is not the first time that I was in depression, I tried every technique I knew that can help me to get out of depression. I tried breathing techniques, running, thinking of positive experience, listening to upbeat music, but it fell short. I still felt very depressed. It did not make quite sense to me at all. It is as if I was working on a giant jigsaw puzzle, but I was missing an important piece. 
 (Skip to here, if you don't want to read background info) 
 At that point, I have been on /r/raisedbynarcissists a couple of times. I could relate to /r/raisedbynarcissists. Yeah yeah my parents are not the best people and yada yada. I only read a few post, I thought it was a subreddit for sorry ass teenagers complaining. Nothing on this subreddit was of value to me to help me succeed in life. I am extremely sorry that I thought that way. I was completely wrong, I should have took /r/raisedbynarcissists much more seriously. It is /r/raisedbynarcissists that enlightening me about my troubles. What really hit home for me was that I did not want to see my parents. I did not want to come home to see my parents like any normal people would love to. That’s when I made the connection that my mother is a narcissistic, and I should take this problem very seriously. It's sometimes crazy to think that my mother should be the most caring and supportive person in my life, but she is actually poisoning me bit by bit since day one. The most important thing I learned on /r/raisedbynarcissists is that  I cannot change my narcissistic mother . I thought I was strong enough to change my mother. That's my mistake. I have to learn to accept I cannot change my mother. I have to be humble and accept that I am absolutely powerless. 
 I finally found my missing piece, but the piece came much larger than I expected. In the last four month I had to reconstruct the puzzle around the new big piece. It might sound insane to some people hearing what I do, but I will do anything to make my life not get ruined by an actual insane person. I found a way to force myself to sleep on schedule. I turned off all my electronics one hour before sleep. I drank chamomile tea and took 8 mg of melatonin every night for the first two weeks. I brought a face mask and earplugs. I sleep at 9 pm and wake up at 5 am every single day for the last four months. This new sleeping pattern helped me to create a solid routine. It made me more grounded, and more on my purpose. It also help be more concentrated at school. It is easier to go LC with my mom. Whatever my mom throws at me, it didn’t affected me. External force are damped when I follow my purpose. That is what my therapist told me. 
 I started going to therapy. I fixed my sleeping pattern before going to therapy. My therapist was astonish. What I am about to say is purely from my experience. I do highly recommend anyone to go to therapy for any type of concerns. Okay, my experience with therapy is that it is not that useful. Let me explain. 90% of the changes is my own efforts and only 10% might be therapist or friends giving guidance. I made up those numbers, but you get the idea. I couldn’t go to therapy that often, because that’s all my university can offer for free. I didn’t go often either, because my therapist reassured me that I am quite self-aware and resilient. I already read a handful of self-help books and I understand how basic human psychology works when I had my first depressive episode. I still go as a checkup. It is nice to have a third party to affirm what I’m doing is indeed correct. Also, therapist are professionally trained to listen. Friends sometimes have preconceived judgement and biases. 
 There’s many changes I made during last four month. I stopped drinking coffee. I am not saying that coffee is bad or anything. I love coffee, but I relied too much on coffee to fix my sleeping disorder. Since I woke up early, I started running again in the morning. Eventually I moved to weight lifting. I learned how beneficial strength training is and I’m getting results. I am more conscious of what I eat. I have to stretch every morning because of the soreness, I take that moment to take deep breath and meditate. I have been working on being more vulnerable lately. Vulnerability helps to create deeper connections with people. My grades are higher than my first two years of university. I’m not top class standing, but I improved a lot. I’m still living with my parents, but I’m in LC. Hopefully I find a job, finish my degree, and move out asap. 
 Finally, you have to treat yourself kindly. If your parents cannot take care of you, become your own parent. Learn about self-parenting. Every time you make a decision ask yourself ""What is really best for myself?"" That’s something one of my friend told me that really stood out to me.","I was really depressed and my Nmom is the cause 
 I cannot change my Nmom!

"email 1: Hey Tiffany, long time fan. I have been planning a road trip for a while now with my best friend and we've been looking for like an overall destination to reach to end our fantastic journey. Two years ago we ended it by visiting Liam O'brien at one of his cons since we love his voice acting. We were wondering if we could do the same for you. However I can't find a list of your con appearances and was hoping so a list so we could come say hi and check out a kickass con as well. Please message me back. 
 -Brandon :D 
 ---email 2: Hi Brandon,
The list should be on my site, so I'd better check that.  Anyway, here's a current list, but I am sure there will be additions as the year progresses. 
 These are confirmed: 
 Alma-con ~ Feb. 10-12, 2012 (Alma, MI) 
 Triad Anime con ~ April 6-8, 2012 (Winston-Salem, NC) 
 Colossal con ~ June 7-10, 2012 (Sandusky, OH) 
 Anime Southeast ~ July 13-15, 2012 (Sevierville, TN) 
 Banzai con ~ Oct. 12-14, 2012 (Columbia, SC) 
 I am also currently in negotiations with cons in Florida, Michigan, Kentucky & Indiana.  Hope to see you at one of them! 
 Take care, Tiffany Grant 
 ---Email 3: :< Unfortunately I'm from the awesome state of California, so it maybe unlikely that the roadtrip would take me all the way to the east coast. Can I mail like 1 or 2 items to be signed? I'll pay for the return shipping and everything too. Please let me know :D 
-Brandon 
 ---Email 4: Well, bummer!  But ya know, I could get invited to a con in California.  I never know what's coming.  In any case, yes you may definitely send me some items to be signed.  Just send it with a return postage paid envelope.  I've done this for people several times.
Thanks!
TG  :o) 
 ---Email 5: Ok, sent the package in the mail today, Just a few items, i think like 4 total. I really appreciate you taking time out of your schedule to do this. I've been a huge fan since i was 14, coincidentally since your famous role had a similar age. I'm 20 now, still a nerd, still watching anime and still into video games. I don't know why i feel the need to tell you a bit about myself, maybe its because I don't want to send you a package with no story or face behind the items in it. I don't want you to sign the items without really knowing just how big of an impact you've had on my life, as well as many others I'm sure. 
 The life and love you put into Asuka inspired me to write a 350 page novel when i was 18. I'm currently in the process of publishing it. I'm sure you hear this often but Evangelion is a great series but without Asuka and without the life blood you provided the series wouldn't be nearly as mind-blowingly good. Honestly the new movie was great but as an Asuka fan, the movie seem flat without her. Yes she's there, but its not the same Asuka, she seems shallow and undeveloped compared to Soryu. Hopefully she will be filled out in the up coming movies. 
 Anyway, I just wanted to thank you, I led a very sheltered, close minded life until Eva. My life has become something truly my own since I've learned to be my own person, have my own opinions, and live my life as if every day were my last. I'll send you a copy of my book when it's finished being edited. I included one chapter in the package if you have the time to read it. It's good to know that behind every great character is an even better, more passionate person who makes them human. 
 Again, Thank you for all you've done, for the community behind Eva and for me as an individual. You may not know it, but voice actors like you, Liam O'brien, and Tera Strong (among countless others) inspire and help a lot of people escape/cope with everyday stresses, tragedies and hardships. I hope this little email helped you put an additional face on that mass of anonymous fans you have. 
-B 
 ---Email 6: Wow, Brandon.  That email was very touching.  It means a lot that you took the time to share that with me.  I did receive the package today, and I should be able to get that back out to you on Monday.   :) 
 Thank you so much for your kind words and your support.  It is deeply satisfying and humbling to hear that I have touched others, and I am grateful to you for letting me know. 
 Best regards,

"I've been in this position before, as the guy. I told my girlfriend that my best friend and I were going out to a bar after a surf. He had just gotten out of a relationship and was feeling pretty down on himself, so when a group of girls asked us why we were sitting at the bar and not dancing, I told the SO that best friend wanted to dance with some girls and that I was going to wingman for him. 
 So we danced with the 3 of them.  As a 27 year old guy, I don't consider grinding a particularly adult thing to do. For me, dancing isn't grinding. I  just danced with the girls (not  on her) and tried to herd them towards my buddy. 
 I wasn't going out there with the expressed intent to dance with girls and my S.O knew that. I think whats bothering you is that your boyfriend's intentions weren't communicated to you and you didn't know what was going on..... 
 My GF has gone out with friends before and danced the night away. I know guys have danced with her, bought her drinks, etc, but I trust her 100%. I know she's not grinding with them.",I agree with juliantheguy ---- you're either lacking in communication or trust. I'm pretty sure my SO trusts me 100%.

"I don't even know why i am here.....but i don't know who to speak to. 
 Basically i had just turned 18 fresh out of high school with the world as my oyster. Then i meet this girl-my good this girl!!!we hit off perfectly and had a wonderful time with laughs and giggles around.She sorted me out.I stopped taking drugs and stopped hanging out with a bad crowd for her because all i wanted to do from the moment i seen her was be with, spend time with her. 
 we quickly got our own place and life was brilliant . we both agreed marriage and kids wasn't a good idea we were young -you need to plan that stuff out. After all my career was skyrocketing due to the fact i had something to work for, to build it just shite hours but it was for our future. 
 Fast forward a while we move to a nicer part of town rented a beautiful flat and then she got a promotion at her work it required longer hours but the pay increase and the future opportunities  were too much to turn down. 
 But we barely spoke too each other and even though i love her with every part of me, i started to take her for granted being tried and moody when she woke me up for breakfast and taking it out on her(this is one example of lots of petty stupid petty arguments). 
 but i suppose lots of small things make a big thing. 
 Then Blam! she is moving back to her  mums she doesn't want any contact with me she cant do it anymore- we had ""grown up and grown apart"".I never realised how much we had grown apart it was really out the blue for me until it was shoved in my face. 
 Now i am sitting here half a bottle of whisky down tears running down my face, (basically) friendless, family a couple hundred miles away and completely lost. I have just lost my entire adult life and my only true friend.

"Just a little note, if this should be put in another subreddit, such as /r/teenagers, please let me know! 
 
 Just a little background, I am a male (17), and I am dating a female (also 17).  We've been dating for about three months now, and we decided to do the deed (side note: we were both virgins).  Everything went fine(great even), except for one small problem.  I didn't cum.  Ever.  We just kept going for a good hour until I just told her we could stop.  This also happened the second time.  At this point I figured it was just because she wasn't that into it (she was in pain, and not too enthused about the act at first).  The third time rolls around (another note, I hadn't masturbated in about five days) she's into it, I'm into it and  blam!  I finish after about a half an hour.  Obviously this is good.

 As I was leaving...
 Kid from work:  ""Yeah man I bet you do a ton of cool stuff""
 Me:  ""yeah man"" 
.... >.< This guy has no idea what kind of things I'm into or anything. I'm not good at conversation. I will laugh and comment on things people say like ""nice"" or ""cool"" but I don't say anything new or do anything And when I hang out with people I will usually just sit in one spot and not move much. 
 I just can't express myself or something. People always say I'm very mellow. I don't get overly mad(except at video games!) or glad. These days my time is filled going on the computer and usually playing whatever video game. Usually an online game. I am usually in a skype call with up to 5 other people. One of them is my girlfriend. 
 I don't know how to ask people to hang out. I never know what to ask people to do to hangout. I only hang out if someone asks me to do something. 
 Never really had my way with women but I talked to my current girlfriend at work a lot (at my old job) and then was too scared to say I liked her, ended up texting it to her later. Today in two year relationship, she always calls me, texts me, etc. I rarely do any of that. I will usually answer if she calls, but don't really do much else for her. She pretty much invites herself over. I never ask her to come over. 
 I'm lazy and often do not shower for days in a row at a time. Some nights I toke(so yes, I smoked marijuana), and usually stay up late as usually, then go right to bed and skip shower, so if I toke multiple nights in a row, it adds to my not showering. 
 Also very lazy with school. Each school year I got lazier and lazier. I've been in honors, ap, classes but I never do the work. Now in college, I barely do anything and have actually failed a few classes. I used to get A's until like middle school. I just play games all the time now. And don't do any homework/studying. 
 I toke with people from work sometimes, and I get nervous because it intensifies the social situation feeling and I can't do anything. 
 I don't know if this is nearly enough information, or if anyone will even read this much, but I feel very lost and I have many times been very suicidal. Mostly was suicidal in high school, when I had the least amount of friends. Now I have a little bit of friends, and I feel fine, but still have suicidal thoughts at times.",I get nervous in social situations mother fucker (anyone?),20,M,socialanxiety
"Edit: Husband is 32, not 22 
 Throw away 
 I've been with my husband for 12 years, married for 8 of those years.  In the beginning things were really, really good.  We were best friends and we did a lot together and had a fairly good circle of friends we hung out with.  I fell in love with him and he with me and I happily married him when he asked.  We have two children ages 4 and 2. 
 I've been a stay at home mom for the last 4 years and some of that is about to change as I'm going to be taking a part time job next week in the field that I've gone to school for (ultrasound tech if that helps).  It's been a struggle for the past three years though and I've reached my breaking point. 
 He has it in his mind how things are supposed to appear and happen.  He really loved the fact that I became a stay at home mom and relished in the fact it was so traditional.  At the time, I thought he was being supportive, but hindsight seems to scream something different at me.  I didn't mind being a stay at home mom, but it did get lonely.  I found a group of local women to keep in touch with to help with the loneliness and really clicked with them.  At first he seemed supportive but slowly he began to chastise me for things they would post on social media (politics, religion, they had varying views from his and he didn't like it) and eventually it turned to ""I don't like you hanging out with them..."" to ""You can no longer talk to them....""  It caused a huge fight but he was so distraught that they were being bad influences that I dropped them. 
 I went back to school so I could start working again, something he's also against without actually being against.  He's told me I need to run any job offers I may get by him and made it hard as hell to do school work because when he was home he demanded all my attention (more on that later).  But ultimately me going back to work is up to him and his decision. 
 I made a few friends in school and I enjoy talking with them, I've become fairly active and have made many connections.  I've excelled in my classes and part of those interactions and drive is how I got the job that I'm starting.  But he hates me having friends. 
 He's gotten to the point where he's always asking who I'm talking to, what are we talking about, wants access to my social media and all my passwords.  The few friends I have managed to bring around he's forbade me from having for various reasons. 
 Today was the breaking point, we were at a concern this weekend and we were waiting for it to get going and a friend of mine texted me asking about our coffee date later this week.  He asked me who I was talking to and what I was talking about and then told me to turn off my phone.  I did. 
 When we got done with the concert and was on our way home he matter of fact told me that he wanted to read my texts because whatever was being said in text he could read because we were husband and wife and everything that goes in my life he should know about.  I felt really off put because these were my conversations but he relayed that he pays for our phones and the bill and he has a right to know, so I relented and gave him my phone. 
 He went through and deleted who he thought I didn't need and told me to cancel the coffee date. 
 His reasoning is that it's his wife and his home and he didn't like the idea of his wife having friends outside of him and who he knew and only wanted me having a few friends that he knew.  When he's home, he wants my 100% attention - the thing is, he's always home or is always wanting to do things as a family, which I'm not against, not at all! 
 But some days I just want a ""me day"" to feel connected to society. 
 He tells me that's selfish. 
 And maybe it is.  I don't know.  He wants me to be his all in all and source of happiness and connection and I'm so very drained from it.  Maybe I'm just a bad wife. 
 He told me if I couldn't be okay with any of it I needed to leave, but I'm hesitant about that because he won't let me take the kids.  He just wants his wife to himself so I feel bad for even enteraining the idea of leaving.

"Oh god, here we go. 
 Yet another tale of crippling insecurity. 
 I (f) am 21, he is 24. 
 I am better than I was - no arguments, no childish tears or catty comments. 
 However, I still cannot watch TV shows that throw excessive (and about half the time unnecessary) nudity at me. I know the difference between nudity that enhances the plot and nudity that enhances HIS plot, if you catch my drift. 
 Watching these shows is difficult when I am alone, never mind with my significant other. 
 How I feel: 
 
 Inadequate 
 
 Worthless 
 
 Defeated 
 
 Upset with ""society"" (whatever that means). 
 
 
 So the issue here is: How do I stop feeling so completely worthless knowing that my S.O. gets to see 1000s of naked women each week (advertising, movies, tv, video games, other media)? How do I feel ""special"" and worth ANYTHING when something better is always there? How do you feel good about yourself when shows like Family Guy have quotes like this: 
 ""Ok, fine, the let me ask you this. If there were a God, would He have put you here on Earth with a flat chest and a fat ass."" 
 Or Game of Thrones has a constant barrage of naked women (and no -hot- naked men) who look NOTHING like me? 
 There are people who are much less fortunate than myself in many departments who still exude this amazing and almost tangible confidence that I honestly don't know I'll ever find. These shows don't phase them. They never -seem- to worry about their S.O.s wandering or thinking less of them. 
 How? 
 I just want to feel secure in my relationship and with myself. 
 It tore my last relationship asunder and while therapy helped, it certainly did not make it go away. 
 Do I need daily affirmations in the mirror? 
 Or is there simply a does of reality I need that I'm not getting? 
 I'm an artist. I draw naked people. It does not phase me. Nudity isn't always an issue. However, I just cannot shake this horrible pounding in my chest whenever a pair of unnecessary tits slap me in the face.","I am insecure. I have a hard time watching even TV shows with my S.O.

"My wife and I are about to celebrate our ten year anniversary later on this summer in July.  I think now that it's been quite a while, the two of us are very much on the same page about exploring things a bit more and not letting ourselves fall into any kind of rut.  That's been the case with traveling, our hobbies, and as our conversations have led into it, more about sex as well. 
 We've known each other and were best friends since we were around 15 years old, started ""dating"" later on in high school, and got married when we were around 21.  Needless to say, we're each others first and only.  I don't think either of us regret a bit of it either. 
 That said, we're both talked with each other if we regretted the way things happened.  Neither of us really do, but I feel like both of us agree that we somewhat regret not dating around or seeing others in bed or whatever.  We were really shy about discussing this early on in our marriage, but we've talked about it a lot more in the recent year or so. 
 Thing is, I don't think either of us really know to what avenue we'd like to explore that.  We've come close to fooling around with good friends in that kind of manner in the past, but either chickened out or decided that it would make things too awkward afterwards.  I know that both of us know that we want to try new and different things and perhaps even bring in someone we can trust, but we don't necessarily know how to do that. 
 I don't necessarily think that either of us really want to be in an ""open"" marriage, as we've both somewhat agreed that we want to both be in the same place and enjoy whatever new thing it is together.  Neither of us want ourselves or each other in a situation where it's just one of us and another person.  But we do somehow want to find a workable situation where a threesome or group thing is possible. 
 So my question is twofold: 
 
 Do we  really want  to do other stuff with other people?  What are the consequences that we might not be considering?  What can anyone who has done this tell me? 
 
 What sort of avenue should we consider if we do move forward with this?  Should we approach a trusted friend?  Personals in another town?  We have no idea.","The wife and I are looking to stay out of a sexual rut by exploring our boundaries a bit more and would possibly be itnerested in doing things with others in a controlled environment.

 I'm the least religious person in my family. I don't wear hijab. I drink alcohol socially. I never go to mosque. I hardly ever pray. I almost never do Ramadan. All the guys I've dated have been non-Muslim (current bf is secular Jewish, and my family likes him). I'm well-educated thanks to my Muslim parents, who pushed as hard in school as my brothers, and I've never once been told by a relative that I belong in the kitchen or any shit like that. But to the 30% Americans who hate and fear Muslims, none of that matters. I'm Arab and my name is obviously Muslim, so I'm Islamic enough for the haters. Hey, the President had a Muslim father and a Muslim stepdad, which seems to qualify you as a Muslim to the haters. I'm gonna be picked on whether or not I'm observant, so I'll stand in solidarity with the women in hijab and the men with prayer bumps on their foreheads. 
 Some people try to ""save"" me from  a religion that NEVER made a difference in my daily life until a bunch of non-Muslims with nothing better to do decided that it had to make a difference . Others turn nasty when they learn my name. And some cowards just decide that I look Muslim and shout abuse, then scuttle away. This has happened to me walking down the street (I live in a big, ""tolerant"" coastal city), on the campus of an allegedly ""elite"" university, on one horrible red-eye flight  non-stop  when I had the seatmate from hell and indifferent flight attendants, on the Atlantic City boardwalk from a fucking cotton candy vendor, and, I shit you not, on  three  first dates with seemingly civilized guys. 
 This has been a part of my life since President Obama took office. But the last eight months have been like nothing I've experienced before. It's not even just bad by American standards. My relatives who live in France are horrified, because Marine Le Pen looks sane next to most of the current Republican candidates. My family in Egypt doesn't want to come visit, because they think they'd be unwelcome. The orange-faced pig (I refuse to write his name) makes me so angry that I don't trust myself to drive when his voice comes on the radio (I pull over and mute it), but frankly at this point he could have a heart attack tomorrow and the problem would still be there. It might even get worse, because I don't think he believes anything he says, and he seems unlikely to win a general election. The next demagogue might be more electable, and might truly believe the sewage he spews. 
 Before the inevitable "" durrrrrrr , Muslims are acting worse than us in the Middle East/Muslims kill Christians/Muslims hate Jews/we're so much better"" response:  THANK YOU  for having the decency to be better than fucking ISIS. Have a round of applause and a gold star, you've cleared that bar. I hoped for better from an ""exceptional"" country, but apparently that's too much to ask. Incidentally, the overwhelming majority of the people ISIS kills  are Muslims . Every month ISIS posts a horror video of their goons killing prisoners. Where do you think they found those prisoners, that they fucking kidnapped them from France? Do you think there are any Christians who willingly stayed behind in Raqqa or Mosul?  THEY ARE IRAQI OR SYRIAN MUSLIMS.  The Kurdish freedom fighters everyone pretends to love? They're like ninety percent Muslim. 
 A rich scumbag fantasizes about shooting Muslims with bullets dipped in pig's blood, and the creeps who like him lap that shit up. From the media and the ""Republican establishment?"" Barely a peep, and Hillary and Bernie were too busy bashing each other to respond to that remark with even ten percent of the fury that was called for. How should I feel, happy and patriotic and grateful for muh_freedoms? It makes me feel disgusted and afraid. It makes me want to move overseas before I start a family of my own, so I can live somewhere where if a major politician  jokes about shooting people like me  he'll actually provoke outrage, instead of being ignored or laughed off. Read about Judaism in nineteen century Europe. Millions of secular Jews wanted to assimilate, but the anti-Semites still saw them as Jews. That's why Zionism began to look like the only hope. 
 I'm fucking ecstatic that the hate rally got cancelled in Chicago. I wish I had been there to help shut them down. You're damn right I'm intolerant of them, because I don't have the luxury of being detached and impartial on this particular fight. Fuck their ""free speech"" (they weren't shut down by the government anyway, they faced protesters and were too chickenshit to stick around), can we talk about my freedom for a second? Freedom to them means the freedom to bully and scapegoat. Freedom to me means getting about my life without being told that I don't belong here. It means my parents being able to fly without getting dirty looks. American democracy is facing its worst existential threat since McCarthyism, and I am not obliged to play fair with people who hate me. 
 I already know what people are going to tell me. ""Hate breeds hate,"" and I'm being as bad as them, yadda yadda. I'll be told to educate them, to excel and set a good example. This makes me want to scream. What the fuck do you think I've been doing with my life? I'll have you know I've led an exemplary fucking life (Sarah Palin should be so lucky to have a daughter like me), and so has everybody in my family. I have ""proven"" myself worthy of trust and respect over and over and over and over, and yet every year of my adult life it has gotten uglier. Sometimes I think the only reason to keep trying in this country is so that I can have a strong visa application when I finally do pack up and move to Canada or Australia. 
 Last thing! I don't want to hear  a fucking word  about how ""most Americans aren't like that.""  FUCKING ACT ON IT , because telling me does nothing, and I suspect that most Americans who ""aren't like that"" just don't care. I'm not saying they're bad people, I'm saying they're complacent and/or ignorant, and can pretend the problem doesn't exist because it doesn't hurt them. Just look at the people refusing to vote for Hillary if Bernie doesn't win, because ""something something Goldman Sachs,"" while I have to worry about more urgent issues like  whether or not our next president will be a man thinks it's funny to joke in public about shooting me . Hell, let's look at the ""establishment"" Republicans. The governor of Florida has endorsed a man who wants to commit war crimes for the presidency, because party unity you guyyyyse, so I think it's safe to say that to the Voldemort-looking prick, I just don't fucking count. These attitudes tell me that Muslims in this country don't matter. It's not that most Americans hate us, it's that  we don't register.  Fascists can bully Muslims to please their little fascist fanboys, and most non-fascist sane people don't realize how scary this is because they haven't internalized the fact that American Muslims are real people who live right here, right now, in the same country as them. Newsflash, we're your neighbors, we're your doctors, we're your Uber drivers, and yes, some of us are your soldiers. Statistically speaking, we're some of the most law-abiding people in this country. I'd bet anything that the more of us there are in your neighborhood, the safer it is. Open your eyes.","I think that about 30% of Americans will always hate Muslims, no matter how hard we try to assimilate and no matter how much we contribute to this country. I don't think the rest of America knows or cares about what this means for us. It would be great if everybody started to pay attention.",24,F,offmychest
"I started going to law school part-time in Fall 2008. I only went part-time so I could keep my full-time job as an intellectual property paralegal. Although this did not give me the greatest amount of time to study, I did pretty well. Generally, it takes 3 semesters to complete one ""year"" of school. 
 I tried to quit after the second semester because I realized I don't really want to work as hard as many associates are required to in order to make the big $$$. It's just not that important to me. My husband disagreed; I know he's mostly interested in me becoming an atty b/c he thinks it will make us rich. 
 Although I thought my husband (who really wanted kids) and I (who was on the fence) agreed to wait until after I finished school to have children, I somehow became pregnant at the end of my second semester (Spring 2009). My son was born in February of this year. I took one week off from school (and 6 weeks from work). 
 I tried yet again to quit for the same reasons as above AND because I needed to be with my child. 
 But sigh, I just went to part-time work and even less hours at school. I made moot court and journal. This past semester was HELL. And my husband has apparently lost all interest in anything I do, but still says he depends on me to ""make us rich."" 
 I will be a 3L at the end of the upcoming semester. With summer school, I should be able to graduate in May 2012. Even though I kept working, I still have significant school loans. 
 At this point, I am still leaning towards quitting despite the loans I already have. By staying in, I am promising myself more unhappiness as I continue in school, more despair when I am actually a lawyer, and even greater debt. But, it also seems incredibly silly to stop now when I am relatively close to graduating.

"I am 28, male and she is 29 female. We are both american and live in the Pacific Northwest.  Together for 4 years and living together for 2. 
 I feel as if my relationship is getting worse as time goes on.  There are several areas where I feel are big sticking points and I am not sure what to do about it. 
 Communication  I dont feel like I can say when I am unhappy about something or disagree with my girlfriend.  Since we both have very demanding careers, I feel that if I bring something up it will put undo stress or cause a fight.  As an example, she is very particular about the way laundry is done.  As such, she does ALL the laundry because I would do it ""incorrectly"".  If I do the laundry myself, I might do it wrong and she could yell at me.  If i ask her to do it, i feel like i'm putting stress on her.  I am also scared to fight with her because she can get  very mean .  I try to fight logically and resolve conflict and she uses it to release steam and sometimes says very mean things. 
 I recognize that communication is VITAL in a relationship, and I dont feel like we have the communication skills needed to function properly. 
 Quality Time   I feel that I avoid fighting and conflict because we dont have a lot of quality time together.  As  i mentioned, we both work a lot and our schedules dont give us a lot of time together.  So the time that we DO have often ends up strained and awkward because there is conflict between us.  I dont want to make it worse by fighting since we have so little free time together. 
 Habits   I feel like my girlfriend and I live very different lifestyles.  She is messier than I so lots of our house is in dissimilar.  I cannot clean ""her stuff"" like laundry because I would do it ""wrong"". 
 Main question/request  Can anybody recommend a book or some tool that I can use to communicate better?  I really suck at conflict and avoid it and I would like to learn how to do it better. 
 Does anybody have any advice on how to work with their partner to live more harmoniously? 
 It is really hard for me to put ""feelings"" into words so I am sorry if any of this is unclear or confusing.  I would be happy to clarify anything if you like.

"I had just received today a letter from my father's landlady notifying me that I must pay a past due electric/water-sewer bill that is in my father's name and unless I due so, she is going to take me to court. She has taken pictures of ""damages"" for her attorney, and already contacted him. I have in no means the ability to pay the amount she wants and has given me until October 1st. 
 A little backstory: 
 My widowed father had rented the house from her roughly 3 years ago, and last October he passed away. From then, I, as the middle child at 20, took responsibility and decided to take hold of my father's assets (not officially, or in any way on official/signed paperwork), and continued to pay the bills with his life insurance money until I could find a more affordable place to live. The place cost roughly $1100 a month to live there, way more than I could afford. The house sat empty for two years prior to us moving in and had/has a lot of damage, including known knowledge that homeless people had broken in and squatted there, which she is now placing the blame on me for. Even after repairing damages and performing maintenance ourselves, though a leaky room and running pipes were never repaired by her which added to an insane water bill, she is unsatisfied. I work a part time job and am struggling to make ends meet at a new apartment I had just recently found. I have not contacted her back yet and am scared shitless. 
 So reddit, I ask you, is there any way I am legally responsible? Or is she just using scare tactics? I am in no way a legal executive to his estate.

"This one was cringeworthy for the boy involved. For background, I was an early bloomer. I had a very mature body when I was 12. My mom's work friend had a son and I heard through the grapevine that he thought I was cute. One day I was walking home from middle school, and this boy drove by and offered me a ride, so he was either 16 or 17. I knew him well enough to trust him, so I accepted the offer. 
 So he was making small talk and flirting and I was sort of trying to flirt even though I had no experience doing it. He casually asked me if I had Mr. Smith for math class and what I thought of the tests or something like that, to which I responded that I never had that teacher because I was in middle school. He clearly had had no idea and assumed I was 15 or 16. To his credit, his tone and demeanor changed as soon as he found out I was 12. Then he was very polite and just dropped me off at my house, thankfully just a minute away by then.

"As the title says I need to start looking for work elsewhere. This year has been horrible as far as work is concerned for myself, 3 months of unstable work days has almost bled my savings dry. (There wasn't much to begin with) 
 A little back story 
 I'm a 22 year old male living in Southern California and I've been working construction since high school with a family friend. After high school I went to college (community) for a few semesters but could not afford to continue, due to financial problems in the household (single mom and two younger brothers). So I went back to work to help out. I've managed to pay more than my fair share on bills, food, etc for the past 4~ish years on an under the table salary making less than 10,000 a year. I barely manage to scrape by as it is. 
 
 This job has taught me many things about working in a construction site. Above all the  safety  and quality.
My job required me to: 
 
 mix cement/stucco (started out doing this) 
 assist both coworkers and home/business owners with any help/questions they had/needed 
 plaster the material (though Lathing is my strong suit) 
 lathe (waterproofing: paper and wire/metal installation process) 
 estimating/bringing supplies needed on each job site 
 overlooking the job site (couple past years I've kind of moved up in the ranks of this particular subcontractors crew) 
 give estimates for jobs 
 ETC 
 
 In my current situation that salary was not so bad for me, I haven't gone hungry, I've got the necessities, I'm not the kind of person to waste money on things I can't afford.  But as we all know, construction has its ups and downs .. Three months missed is too much, and I just feel like I'm wasting all my potential sitting around waiting for work to kick back up. I want more than to live paycheck to paycheck (figuratively), I need a  stable job . 
 So what choices do I have? I've thought about government programs like Job Corp and other various trade schools, but looking further into it they require me to be away from home making little to no money at the time. I can't just stop paying bills, my family depends on the money I bring in. I'm stuck.

 Also digestion-related, about a year ago i started getting very strong pains in my abdomen that would come and go.

"So a brief summary of us to start. There's me, Alan who's 25, Brenda who's I think 26 and Catherine who is definitely 26. We've been a group since mid-November when Catherine replaced our old housemate. 
 I would say we all get along quite well. Catherine and Brenda know each other from uni and are close, if not best, friends. I am decent mates with Alan and I'll hold off on Alan and the girls for now. 
 My relationship with the girls is a funny one. When they are on their own they are nice and friendly but together they are like shy school girls and it becomes a lot harder to engage with them. They also tend to decline opportunities to get involved with me and Alan. 
 I don't think this is a sign of any inherent dislike on their part however. I'm fairly certain it is just their personalities combined with the fact I'm from an area where more extroversion is expected. In fairness, it could also be that they think the invites are terrible but don't want to admit it. I am a bit concerned that after this amount of time they do not seem to be shaking this off though. If anything it looks like it might be getting worse for reasons below but again I might be expecting too much. 
 Now this is where it gets complicated/interesting. It turns out Alan has a thing for Catherine. I knew he thought she was attractive but in actuality it goes a fair bit further. He, at some point around the end of November/start of December, asked her out and she, arguably fairly, said no. It is my understanding that  quite soon after Catherine started going out with another lad. I'm not sure on the details because I've never felt it was any of my concern. 
 Back to Alan. This has hit him quite hard to the point where he says he considered moving out. He says he got over that as an overreaction (and also impossible) but he's still not feeling fantastic about it. It's not so fun being around him at the moment and if I'm perfectly honest I'm beginning to lose patience with it. 
 From the other side I've noticed that he's become not so much abrasive but forthright. He's always been a bit like that but recently it seems to have gotten more common, more extreme and possibly being taken too far. I'm worried this is driving the girls away from him and by proxy me. 
 Obviously this is not a situation I would like to continue.  How can I help this before it gets out of hand?","housemates seem to be drifting apart for some reason, not discounting an unrequited romance.",25,M,relationships
"I was dumped at the beginning of this February. She said that she did not love me anymore and that she did not see a future with me. The first month was really bad; lost weight, cried, begged, etc. 
 Then at the beginning of March I was terminated from my engineering position. Losing my job didn't hurt, it was the rejection I felt; I just kept wondering ""what is wrong with me?"" 
 The first Sunday after losing my job I called my ex after not talking with her for a couple of weeks. I felt that maybe she'd had enough time to think over things. I started the conversation just fine, but a few minutes later I was basically back to pleading with her to reconsider and give me another chance. She simply said no, and that she was over me and that I needed to move on. After she hung up I just felt numb... Like, is this how it ends? 
 In January we were making love and talking about a future where I would let her have chickens and turtles in the house if she wanted. And the dogs could sleep on the bed, and how cute our mixed babies would be (I'm Mexican, she is Vietnamese). Like how did that change so fast? 
 That same Sunday I posted an ad on Craiglist basically saying it was my first time, and that I was curious about giving oral to another man. 
There was a response within 30 min from someone that lived 10 min away and we met up. I ended up giving him head on two occasions. After that I started posting more. To date I have met up with 6 men, and have given or received oral sex multiple times with each one. 
 Usually I would hook up for a week or two, then call her and see how she was, and if she felt different about us, then hook up some more when she rejected me. 
 When she dumped me she gave me other reasons besides simply not being in love with me anymore. She didn't like that I had few friends and didn't make time to go out with the boys. She thought that I was not romantic like I used to be. She said that I had let myself go, and that my muscles were not big like they were. She said her friends did not like me, and that I was socially awkward. The worst is that she confessed she felt this way for over a year but was trying to work through it. 
 Should I be mad about that or happy she at least tried? 
 She did not communicate all this to me very well by the way. I did not know that she was thinking of leaving me over these things. I worked full time as an engineer in a really stressful position. I made time to cook meals for myself and her during the week, and I made sure she had gas money when she was struggling. I didn't make it a priority to keep in touch with friends like I should have. I did not get fat, but I did lose my muscles. 
 I did plan dates for us but I guess they were not up to her standards. I have taken her to see and experience cool shit over the years (art, museums, zoos, botanical gardens, aquariums, beaches). All that is on top of the standard stuff that comes with me. I made meals for her, I showered her with verbal and physical affection. She never had to worry about me doing anything behind her back or about drama. My immediate and extended family treated her really well, because they know me and know they better have! 
 Sex life was good, but she mentioned that it was sometimes one sided in my favor. And she is 100% right (she gave me a lot of head). But the overall relationship was one-sided in HER favor by a lot. 
 She met my immediate family 5 months into our relationship. Then met my extended family 3 months later. She got to have a relationship with my sisters, cousins, my mom and dad. They treated her very well. 
 In almost five years I had ZERO meaningful conversations with her sisters. I didn't even meet her family until we had been dating for 2 years. They didn't treat me well, and we never got close. I offended her brother once and he never spoke to me after that. I constantly felt like I had to 'earn' their respect. 
 To be honest it is good that she left me because she was not a good girlfriend, and I did not feel fulfilled. I think I wanted to orgasm a lot because I was not fulfilled in other areas. So I asked for head a lot. I feel really shitty about that. I don't want to repeat that pleasure-seeking pattern. 
 For the last several months many people have come forward to tell me that I could do so much better than her, and that they never said anything because I was in love and it was not their place. Family & friends have all told me it is a great thing she left me. 
 People tell me I am extremely good looking and that I am a catch. 
 Not saying that to brag, but to say that 'I' don't feel that way. I feel ugly, and that I have nothing to attract a woman. I feel boring and not at all sexy. 
 Two weeks ago I checked out a motel room and hooked up with a guy for over 4 hrs. We made out, gave each other oral, and ended up cuddling. The whole encounter was really intimate, and we spent a lot of time touching and cuddling. 
 At the same time I have made all those changes she wanted. I have a great group of friends going again. I am really fit again, and have my muscles back. I plan things and follow through. She still does not want me back. 
 Today I decided I didn't want to keep hooking up. I met up with some 19 yr old at his place. We cuddled and that was so nice. 
 Like that is what I miss, that is the hole I am trying to fill. The intimacy with the person you love. That is way more than sex, way more than cumming. We cuddled, then he blew me and I came. I still feel so empty. This is not working, it is making things worse. 
 I don't want to hook up with strangers anymore, but I don't know what to do now. If I improve and become a great person and meet someone new and fall in love again... How the hell would I explain what has been going on for the last three months if it ever came to light?

 Some background on my family dynamic, I am 29, married with 3 kids. My little brother and sister ages 12 and 15 respectively live there.  I say this as an areguement against me being brainwashed, I've watched it all go down. 
He then went on to say that he deserves to see his kids because he ""would do anything for them.""  That's when my sister asked if he would go into treatment for us.  He said anything except that.  Needless to say she burst into tears and left the room.  His mom and his best friend are without a doubt enablers.  I have contacted them both for help and they say he isn't addicted because spice is legal.  There is something else preventing him from going because when pressed, the only reason he had was because he doesn't think he needs it.  I know I can't make him go, no one can, but is my only option really to cut him out?  He isn't the same dad that raised me and I dont want him anywhere near my wife or kids. He has lied about smoking, stolen jewelry to pay bills, and can't hold down a job.  I wouldn't let anyone else like that around, so that goes for him too.  I dont know what else to do though.  How I can keep him AND help him.","my dad exhibits many signs of addiction but claims he doesn't need help, even if not getting help means he can't see his kids.  What are my options.",29,M,AlAnon
"hi reddit, 
 i'm so stupid! 
 my ex-boyfriend (26) and me (f-24) have been together for 5 years, but broke up about 7 months ago. 
 my friend told me, that he just recently started dating again. i thought i was cool with it, but apparently i'm not. 
i knew that yesterday he was going to meet some of his mates at a pub, so me and a few girlfriends went there, too. we pre-sipped, so i was already a little tipsy when we arrived. i acted surprised meeting him there. 
 we talked, and had a few too many shots of Jager... 
we left the pub, and went to his place. i spend the night, we had sex, and this morning was just too weird. i apologised, for my actions. i told him that i can't handle the thought of him being with someone else. he said, that i was the one who wanted the break up, and that he needed to do a lot of thinking. he then asked me to leave... :( 
 i'm usually not like this. i would never ruin a relationship out of jealousy. and i would never make anyone drunk to have sex with me. 
 i just realised, that i miss him, and that i still love him. i don't want him to have another girlfriend. when i broke up with him, i thought it was for the better. even though we lived together, we barely got to see each other, because we were just too busy.
he wanted me back, texted me, called me, tried everything, but i just had this stupid idea, that perhaps we were better off without each other, and that i didn't love him anymore... 
 but that's not true! i still love him more than anything. 
 i know that probably none of you can help me with this, but i just needed to tell someone! 
 thank you for reading... <3","miss my ex. thought i didn't love him anymore, but still do. we both got drunk last night and had sex. what to do?

"So this is how the things are.. We've started dating 2 and a half years ago. She is coming from a pretty unstable family, and she had pretty hard childhood (parents divorced, mistreatment from her father, she moved to live with her mother 4 years ago). 
 When we've met, I immediately saw something special in her. I'm not usually a person who attaches to someone too easy, and with her everything was really special from the beginning. She felt the same for me as well. This was also to be first serious relationship for both of us. As for the sex life, we've taken each others virginity and we really enjoyed sex for these years. It's been frequent, let's say 1-2 times a week. We visited a lot of places, traveled a bit, really attached to each other..I was the first person she ever could really trust in her life, because almost everyone else in her life was abusive towards her in some way. She said that to me many times, as well as her mother did. Her mother said multiple times how happy she is for her to having me. My girlfriend had a lot of friends in the past that were using her for many things and she's always been in very bad circle of people which made her miserable when she found out what's been happening behind her back. I've always supported her in any her ambitions, plans..helped her to finish high school, and helped to get in the college, whilst no one even in her family believed in her. She really loved me, as I really loved her, and I still do. I know that we are pretty young, and met when we were pretty young as well, but that shouldn't be an obstacle if we're happy with each other. We saw each other at least 3-4 days in a week, and slept at each others house whenever we could. (we both still live with our parents) 
 She really fulfills me in every way in my life, is my support in anything I do and plan to do, and she's really the only person that really knows me. Now, everything was really fine, as usual, until like a week ago. 
 We haven't had sex for couple of weeks, but that wasn't really a problem for me, because we are pretty busy at the college these days. I thought that was all normal, but I saw something was bothering her all the time. Whenever I asked her what was it, she would just say that it's nothing, that everything is fine. I knew something isn't. 
 We've had some little fights every now and then, but that's pretty normal for any couple. We are together for 2,5 years, so that's expected to happen. And what happened today, really left me speechless, weak and I can't calm myself, at all. That's why I had to tell this somewhere, I chose to write it down here, because I really need some advices, from anyone, very, very bad. 
 She called me today, and we've had this little chat as every day, what's going on, how's the weekend passed and all. And then all of the sudden she says, that she's been thinking about leaving me for quite some time, and that's been bothering for quite a while now. All in shock, I asked her why. She said that lately she feels almost nothing towards me, can't see me in the way that she did before. That she's totally cooled down for me. That made me turn into a stone, literally, because I knew she meant that, the way she was speaking. She said that she can't see us together for much more time anymore, and that's what she really feels. She said that she wished I did something wrong, but I didn't. And is convinced that she isn't a bad person for that what he feels. Don't get me wrong, I don't think that either. The thing is, what I feel, that when she really needed someone to be with her, in tough times of her life, I was there. I always was, and still am. But now as she stood on her feet, I think she wants to be free. She said that, that she wants to be free. I did nothing wrong, still love her, and really couldn't imagine one day without here, and there she is, saying that she doesn't want to be with me anymore. Just a week ago, but literally a week a go, she said to me that she really loves me, and that she will never let me go. 
 I am SO confused, I'm trembling, my whole body is, can't control my thoughts.. I really planned everything with her in my life. Well, not that literally because you never know what life can bring to us.. But I am genuinely happy, always here for her, always please her, whatever she needs..and I don't even ask anything for a return. She's always been a support to me, we've spend 2,5 years that have been truly amazing.. And I really couldn't imagine myself without here. I've attached to herself completely, as she did for me. 
 And yes, that happened today. I'm in shock. I need someone to tell me something, ANYTHING about this..because I'm on the edge of tears.. I know that I did nothing wrong, as even she says that. She says I was perfect for her. But sounds so sure about everything she said to me today. Sorry for the long post, but I'm really miserable. REALLY miserable, and in shock, in disbelief.. I really need some advice, from anyone.. So please, please read if you have time, say something..I'm desperate for any reply. Sorry if the post is too long, but I feel that my head is in the clouds, feel dizzy and really don't know what to do, how to feel, what to say..","Relationship got very serious from the beginning because of the life situation of both of us, we made a lot of sacrifices, loved each other, built these 2.5 years around each other completely, these one of the most important years.. I still love her and always will but she says she cooled for me just like that. I'm desperate, I don't know what to do, and I know I couldn't live one day without her. Please reddit, give me any advice, say something.. I'm on my knees.. 
 And if it might look exaggerated to someone.. No, I've lost a lot of friends, sacrificed so much to be with her when she needed it. And I didn't regret it, because it was for her. She's the only person who really knows me. I pretty much don't have anything except her. I could always rely on her, tell her everything. I've literally build myself around her, as she did with me.",21,M,relationships
"Hello all you inspirational fittitors! I'm in need of your always sage advice. I am 30 y/o and while I adore the feeling of lifting and doing the occasional endurance event (2 half marathons last year), I am in very poor shape and feeling very discouraged as I have not worked out consistently in a long time. 
 I have had a host of medical problems which have kept me out of the gym and not just because I was physically unable to work out, but also because the drive hasn't been there. I do miss the feeling of endorphins on full blast and feeling super strong. 
 I have spent a lot of time lurking here and on r/fitness. I have the Strong Curves book but did not stick with the program long term, mainly because I was concerned I was exacerbating underlying issues with poor form and because I don't care much for bodyweight exercises. Ah hell, if I'm being really honest, I just wasn't dedicated at the time. 
 I recently started up with a dietitian and I'm not super thrilled. She has told me a lot of things I already know from my background in medical science, as well as my research online. 
 For a long while, I've wanted to get started up again with a personal trainer. I've had 2 trainers in the past 10 years: one was a woman who was very sweet but not very qualified and kept me using a lot of machines and pilates gear when I wanted to lift heavy (this was at an all women's gym that made it clear they did not emphasize free weights), the other was a male model who was also very pleasant but was really just working as a PT to supplement his income from modeling gigs. I stopped going to my PTs within 6 months of starting. I won't put all the blame on them and will say that a lot of it was my own sense of demotivation. 
 I am scheduled to have a consultation and free workout with a new trainer who competes regularly and is a fitness author. 
 So here are my questions: 
 
 Should I try another trainer or should I just keep trying to figure it out on my own?  
 
 
 How have you busted through personal roadblocks and feeling discouraged? (I know relying on motivation isn't the way to go).","Needing guidance: history of injury, should I start with a new trainer when I've been unsuccessful with personal training in the past?

 Maybe a more accurate term would be 'chaser'. They tend to be skinnier guys who are into larger men. 
 As far as the dating thing goes, it can suck. I spent years feeling like an unattractive creeper because I was going to the only gay event I knew of: my local gay pride. It was hosted by the local campus of the state college, and most of the participants were college age, whereas I was a few years older (25-30 to their 18-20). I made some friends but I had always felt like no one wanted me sexually. Then I started going farther afield and went to the 'big city' approximately 2 hours away. I discovered the bear community, and holy cow! Not only was I not a creeper, I was hot and guys I thought were hot too started lining up. After going to a few Bear events, I found my husband, and we've been together for almost 5 years now.","Maybe a change of venue is in order.

"I don't know where to start and where to end. I will try my best to put my situation across. 
 Case 1: I am a 23 year old Indian Male, I am working in one of the MNC in India. I was supposed to go on-site last year June to one of the middle-east countries, fuck the ISIS, because of them the country is unsafe and the project on hold. I was sitting idle till September and then they posted me to another project. In the new project on my female colleague falsely accused me of harassing and misbehaving with her. It went to my manager, that moron without any investigation dropped an Warning Mail to me. I felt devastated, she started spreading rumour about me in the office. All started to look at me as if I committed a murder. My manager had a talk and let me, since no action was taken ( Because I didn't do anything wrong), she escalated to the Senior Manager, even he had a talk and let me go. She was not satisfied and has raised the issue with the HR head now. She has been doing all this because I was adjudged best performer. I think her aim is to throw me out of the company, now everyone interact with me in not so good way. 
 Case 2: I am in a 3 year relationship with my GF. It is a long distance relationship. I used to trust her so much. Around 4 months back she kinda cheated on me. (No, she didn't have sex, but she let some other guy grope her when she was drunk. And she had just 1 beer, I know she doesn't get that drunk for 1 beer.) But she kinda tells me that she was drunk, and he took advantage of her. Then she reveals he was texting her all kind of nasty things like asking her for kiss and talking dirty sutff, since he was a good friend of hers she didn't discourage him to a great extent. Now since last 2 months she has stopped talking to him. 
 But this incident has made me into a crazy psychopath, I need to know where she is, with whom she is, stalk her last seen on whatsapp, question her why she stays up so late in the night, restrict in wearing various clothes, restricted her from going to salsa parties, waiting for her to reply me everytime I text her, In short I am getting obsessed about her, that my brain doesn't function anything other than this. I used to love her so much. I gave her everything, but since that incident my love has decreased drastically. Now I feel I don't even love her. Relations are based on trust, why did she have to break my trust? I am going crazy, we have regular fights these days. I hate fighting with her. I don't trust her one bit. 
 Case 3: My mom wants me to become an IAS officer (This is really respected jobs in Government Sector). And one of the toughest exam. 500,000 people apply for this job and only 1000 people get the job. I am interested in this as well, I think with little practise I can crack it, but I want to try it after couple of years. And in India I live with my parents, I have to listen to them, show them how much money I spent and support them financially as well. 
 But I am on the verge of a startup creation. I am dedicated in this, but my mom wants to stop all these bullshit(Startup) and concentrate on that Government exam. This is leading to daily fights in my home, I and my mom literally fight everyday. I have to ask them permission to go out on weekends, My dad has his business, he scolds me that I don't support the house or his business and I am always wasting my time roaming in the weekends (I go out to work on my startup idea) If I explain that to him, he thinks I am wasting my time doing nothing. I even got funding for my startup. They just don't understand, they keep saying I don't help them. 
 Case 4: In India the gals get married soon, my GF is forcing me to marry her within next year. I am going crazy, how can I support both my parents and GF after marriage financially. I feel so many things are going around that my head will literally blast. My mom has told that I should get married after 27 years at least. She on the other hand wants me to tell my parents about her and get married next year. My parents are conservative, I really have no idea how they'll react. They literally think I am useless because I didn't study in IIT/NIT (Top colleges in India for Engineering). She wants to get married and move abroad, I tried telling my mom that I want to move abroad, but she doesn't want me to leave India at any cost. I am so fucked in life. I can't handle these things anymore. 
 Recently I came to know that I am Narcissist Personality Disorder. My GF, my mom, my friends everyone were complaining about behaviour, I searched it up online to find that I am extremely narcissist. And don't give a shit about anyone, rather I am just obsessed about me.","After the fake accusation I lost all my interest in my job, I do nothing at office just browse around things, I lost interest in GF after that incident, I love her but I don't love her as well. I hate my parents, they think I am useless, I didn't study well to enter the top-tier engineering college.

"My brother(John) and his wife(Anna) called me to see if I would be willing to go on a blind date with a  female  woman named(April), at first I was against it, but they convinced to just go for it saying that ""I had nothing to lose"" so I said sure. 
 The problem is that I am a very reserved/ inside myself kind of person, and I have done very little interacting with  females  women in general (Whatever the minimum requirement for interaction with a specific person would be, that is what I a give, no more, no less). 
 They gave me April's number and told me to text her, and I did (It took me the entire day to build up the courage to do so). The conversation when all right I guess just general questions and whatnot nothing serious. Anna eventually told me to ask April if she would like to go out to dinner. I thought it was a little rushed, but as I said I have no experience with this so I went along with what Anna said and asked April out to dinner. I was expecting her to say no but April accepted, and now I am picking her up Thursday, 7pm at her place. 
 This is especially intimidating because she is 19 a junior in college and seems to have life figured out. Whereas (one word?) I am 24 Just started going back to school, still live with my parents still and am only slowly becoming less of a failure so to speak. 
 This whole thing makes me pretty nervous and I don't know what to do. I did Ask John for advice because these are things he's never had to work on.

 *How do I dress? 
 *What do we talk about? 
 
 How do I not come off as generally creepy weird, shy, Etc.? 
 
 *What do I do before picking her up? 
 *What do I do when I arrive at her house?

"Let me start by saying that my father and I have been estranged since I was 13.  I'm now 23 years old.  Like so many other troubled father/son relationships the catalyst to our problems was my parents divorce.  I was an only child and probably knew more than I should have.  I was asked to take sides by both of them and it was a grueling two year long process.  My mother was left devastated and I chose to stay with her.  It really forced me to step up as a man.  My dad remarried very very quickly and had another child.  When I was 13 and he moved his soon to be wife in their house that's when things escalated and I moved out.  After that we did not talk for seven years. 
 Seven years later, all parties are doing better.  My mother has recovered emotionally and financially.  I was in college and working full time.  He begins working at my place of employment and we are forced to see each other.  Over the course of a few months we started saying hi, then talking, and then started going out to eat.  After about a year of coaxing I went over to his house to see the place. 
 This January I was at his house and we were in a verbal disagreement.  He could not understand why I didn't like his new wife and refused to be around her.  Eventually we agreed to just go on with our lives and ""agree to disagree.""  We haven't talked or seen each other in 11 months.  We've never done anything father/son ish since I was 13.

"So this was actually two years ago when my dad and I were flying back home to Michigan from Europe on a trip we'd been saving for for about eight years. There was a fuck up including my passport expiring before we left (more on that in a different post) which screwed up our plane tickets, and basically, I didn't have a seat on the plane home until 24 hours before the flight. Worse came to worse I'd be homeless in London for a while. Sounded good to me! 
 Against my best wishes, the 24 hour period comes, and my dad and I are able to pick out another seat for either of us to sit (we'd already bought both of the tickets, but one seat wasn't available for whatever reason). My dad was 63 at the time, and had a super cramped seat in the dead center of the plane, but there was one that had opened up farther back that was next to an aisle (those of you on flights know how much better that makes longer trips). We decided to get that one for me, and called to see if they could switch the seats. Airline confirmed, and my dad had a little more breathing room! Wahoo! 
 So begins the realization of my fuck up. I help carry my dad's things back to his spot, and surrounding him are six or seven GORGEOUS girls about my age. I look at him, he looks at me, I give him the most helpless face I can muster. The fucker smiles the most sinister I've ever seen. He plops right on down in his seat and begins to meet his neighbors.  THIS WAS NOT IN A CREEPY WAY AT ALL. HE IS JUST GENUINELY A NICE GUY.  I saunter back on to my cramped seat a few rows up and make myself comfy for the trip. 
 When we land, I'm getting off and hear someone yell my name. I look back and it's one of the girls my dad was sitting by. She smiles and says, ""I'm glad you and your dad had a great trip, /u/amlb146 [1] ! He told us all about it! You're lucky to have such a great father!"" I'm absolutely floored. 
 Another one. ""Hey /u/amlb146 [2] ! Hope that corn wasn't too bad this time around!"" This one fucking got me. My dad was telling them embarrassing stories from my childhood!

"I [F21] lost my virginity to my boyfriend [M21] in April. We use condoms alone and usually pull out with the condom still on. The sex has been good, but with our own busy lives, we usually only get to see each other once or twice a week. For the most part, we have avoided sex during my fertile window by pure chance. We just were too busy with school or work to hang out during those days Which made me feel a little better during those days.

"I was lurking this sub for a while and now I feel the need to let my thoughts out. 
 Big thanks for everyone who actually reads it all. 
 Main infos: 25 y/o, male, born and living in a capital city of Central Europe. 
 As far back as I can remember I was always introvert and a loner, even in preschool I knew that I was more sensitive than the others. I remember those feelings, when I realized that I've done something in a wrong way, (even if it was only a coloring book that I messed up) I felt really strong shame and I was already in tears. 
Then came school and high school and though I remained introvert and shy I made some friends and everything was easier. But those deep feelings were always with me in every work, in every new task. I learned to control and repress them. 
 After high-school I went to 5 different universities/colleges, because after 5-6 months in a school I always felt bored and uncapable of going to the same course for 3-4 years. 
But I have to admit that the main reason was the people. I have a serious problem with communication. Everytime when I'm talking with someone, who isn't in my inner circle, I always feel as I'm just faking the conversation. I don't want to sound rude, but my experience is that the avarage human being is stupid and selfish, but he/she makes every effort to hide these facts and this hypocritical thinking is what I can't stand, I almost immediately see through their lies and this makes me stressed and more closed. 
 After years of trying to find my path I was partying for almost half a year, drinking almost every night until I met with a girl. She meant so much for me.. I felt that for her I can live an ordinary life I can bare living the weekdays, so I accepted one of my family members offer and I started my ordinary desk-job living my personal horror with the non-ending chit-chat and with the vulgar jokes (which is what I hated the most) of my stupid coworkers. We broke up with the girl after 6 months, of course, because she didn't fall in love with the ""office worker me"", but the careless boy who was always in the best parties. She wanted to travel the world. /And she was almost a decade older than me, but strangely that just started to bother her after 6 months/. 
 I was caught in my own trap.. I couldn't leave the job because I didn't mean to dissappoint my family and I was living with my mother, who barely could pay the bills, so we needed the extra. So I lived the horror for another year and everytime they asked me how do I feel, I always answered that everything is fine, but I didn't know how to end the situation. Every day was a hell, I started to hurt myself and focusing on the pain just to keep myself on a functioning level. All I needed to do is talk to my manager, that I don't want to work there anymore, but my manager was my uncle and I knew that if I fail in the job that would be an embarrassment even to him. 
 On the summer I went to holiday for a week with my father (who lives separately since I was a baby) and with my two little halfbrothers and when I had to go back to work I just didn't. Something went off in my mind and I went to a nearby hill and just sit there for hours. I spend the next day shouting and crying in my bed. I guess I had a little nervous breakdown. The third day my family took me to the psychiatry, that was a frightening experience, but fortunately they let me home with the diagnosis of mixed anxiety-depressive disorder and with some medications. 
After 7 months now I am more closed than ever. I tried to learn code, play guitar, nothing interests me in longer term. Every time I want to start something new those repressed feelings come to me and everything just feels wrong. Just the thought of applying to a new job fills me with anxiety. I only ""live"" online with the exception of meeting with my two close friends once a week, but that's usually just a few hours drinking and talking in a pub. 
Tomorrow I have an appointment with a dentist for root canal treatment and it sounds ridiculous, but I don't care about the pain, I'm only scared about the conversations and awkward situations. That's the most frustrating about my condition, that I can ""see through"" the avarage people, sometimes even I can predict their movements, their thoughts, but I'm still terrified of them. I just don't know how to function properly and use these skills in real life without being a villain. 
 Today I decided that I will get fit for this summer and made some ""before-photos"" of myself. Maybe that's the way out from this situation, I really hope that these photos will be enough motivation for me. Usually I just exercise for one or two days really hard then I gave up, like I do with everything else.. but not now!

"This fuck-up actually happened last night, but that's close enough to today, right? 
 If you're from the south (like me), you know firsthand the otherworldly mouthgasm that is Blue Bell ice cream. You also know what a struggle the past few months were going through the summer months without it. Blue Bell returned a couple weeks ago, but last night was my first time eating it since April. I'll take this opportunity to mention that I have built up a slight intolerance to lactose in the past few years. I can still eat nearly all dairy products and have never had any issues with ice cream, but I can no longer drink milk without getting violently ill. 
 Skip ahead to last night. I bought a pint of Blue Bell Homemade Vanilla ice cream and was so psyched to eat it. I showed up to my boyfriend's, pint in hand, and proceeded to eat the entire damn thing. It was fucking heavenly. After I finished, my boyfriend and I decided to go study with some of our friends for a bit, since we all had a test the next morning. We showed up to the study room around 9:30pm and got to work. 
 About 2 hours later, all was going well. We were studying intently, and everyone was being quiet. It was about this time I felt the tell-tale stomach cramps that meant trouble was soon approaching. I shot my boyfriend a text: ""I'm going to need a bathroom... soon."" Upon inspection, I discovered the only bathroom was attached to the study room, with only a thin wooden door between the two. Everything could be heard, especially with the room so quiet, so I knew that wouldn't be an option for my approaching issue. However, the pain passed, and I convinced myself I could hold off until I finished reading my chapter and walked home. I told my boyfriend I could make it until midnight. 
 Midnight came, and I felt pretty okay, but decided to go ahead and pack up, so I could go home and be in close proximity to a more private bathroom. My boyfriend noticed and began packing up as well. He asked me if I could hand him his book on the opposite side of me. I began to reach over and immediately froze. In that second, the most intense pain I have ever felt in my twenty years of existence ripped through my bowels, and I released the most rank SBD known to man. I thought that would be the end of it, but to my horror, my bowels could no longer hold in the dreaded milky concoction, and I promptly began to shit my pants. I clenched my ass cheeks for deal life, grabbed my backpack and my boyfriend's apartment keys (his apartment was closer to the study room than mine), and practically ran for the door. I truly thought I could make it the two blocks to his apartment, until I actually started walking, which sped up the process considerably. 
 It was now approximately 12:15 am, so there thankfully weren't many people out and about. I felt that familiar sharp pain in my intestines and felt the sweat beading on my forehead. In that instant, I became an animal. All of my humanity was stripped away as I shed my backpack, keys, and phone in a trail behind me. I had no concept of shame or vanity or decency as my instincts had me running toward a somewhat dark alley between two apartment buildings, where milliseconds after ripping off my shorts and underwear, the most unholy liquid came pouring out of my bum, my eyes filling with tears as I braced myself against an AC unit outside of one of the buildings.
At this moment, my boyfriend caught up to me, beheld the scene in front of him and said with a horrified expression, ""Please don't do this."" 
 But I couldn't stop. It just kept coming. Whatever shred of dignity I had left after sharting my pants was lost in that alleyway. And my boyfriend witnessed the entire event, too horrified to look away.
Thankfully, it subsided long enough for me to pull up my pants and waddle to my boyfriends apartment, where I proceeded to desecrate his bathroom for another 20 minutes or so.
I have sworn off ice cream for the time being.","Ate a pint of ice cream despite being mildly lactose intolerant, sharted my pants while studying, tried to get to a bathroom, then shit in an alley in front of my boyfriend.",20,M,tifu
"Twas a glorious fall Saturday, a crisp coolness and college football occupied the living room of my small apartment. A day well spent watching giant young ""students"" give each other concussions while I yelled at the TV and frightened people walking by outside. I began the night full of enthusiasm and wonder at how life could get any better. 
 At some point my sister sent me a text asking if I wanted to join her for a party that night. I gladly agreed. We were both attending college in the same city, she at a prestigious Ivy League institution, and I always had a good time with her group of friends. Before heading out I decided to take several acetaminophen tablets in an attempt to subdue a late onset headache that was obviously trying to fuck up my swag. ""Not tonight body"", I thought to myself. ""There is work to be done."" 
 Little did I know about the highly volatile combination of acetaminophen and alcohol. This might've been my first mistake. 
 Upon arrival, we began pre-gaming with tequila shots and beer pong. It was explained to me that the night's activity was a game called golf. The rules of golf are fairly simple: various occupants of the dorm host ""holes"" in their respective rooms. Each ""hole"" is themed with a different drink, and the goal is to make it to every hole and have one of each drink. Needless to say, I did not get very far. 
 Around hole 2, I began to get very woozy, which was strange because I hadn't drank very much. I remember leaving the group and walking outside with my mojito filled solo cup in an attempt to get some fresh air. As I sat down on a park bench things were getting very blurry... 
 When I next regained consciousness, I immediately knew something was wrong. Looking down, my shirt had been cut off my body and was replaced by weird sticky things connected to wires. I looked to my side and saw an IV bag leading to my arm. ""Why am I in the hospital? What the fuck happened?"", were my immediate thoughts. I also realized I was still extremely drunk, but could not find any clues in my memory as to how or why I was here. About this time, a nurse noticed I was conscious and came in to talk to me, but I was so out of it I couldn't understand her at all. I fell back asleep and was awakened by the same nurse telling me it was 5 am and I had to leave now to make room for other patients. She suggested I call someone to come get me. 
 As I stumbled towards the hospital lobby, I took stock of what I had. A hospital gown, kindly provided by the assholes that cut my shirt off instead of pulling it over my head, and my socks. No wallet, no phone, no shoes, and most importantly, no idea where the fuck I was or why. When I got to the lobby I attempted to use their phone to call my sister, but I was too inebriated to figure out how to dial an outside line and gave up in frustration. I didn't like how the people in the hospital were looking at me, so I decided fuck this and left. As I'm walking down the street in my hospital gown and socks, trying to find a landmark or something recognizable in an unfamiliar city, a car pulled up beside me. A nurse who had been working when I came in had just ended her shift and asked me if I needed a ride. I gladly accepted. 
 She told me that I was near my sister's school and dropped me off close to her building. It was still very early and no students were coming out of the building, so to get inside I had to bang loudly enough on the doors to attract the attention of the cleaning lady vacuuming inside. A cleaning lady who didn't speak English. I then spent several minutes trying to explain to this bewildered woman why I needed to get inside to talk to my sister. She finally let me in and I made my way up to my sisters room. I knocked on her door and was greeted with several bouts of overwhelming laughter as all I could say was ""what...the fuck...happened? 
 Long story short, they found me outside and took me to a bathroom where I proceeded to vomit violently for a prolonged period of time. At some point the head of the dorm building came in, saw me, and ordered that an ambulance be called. Something about me dying and liability... 
 I still have very little memory of that night, but did leave with one lasting souvenir: a $2500 bill from the hospital visit and ambulance ride.",Took acetaminophen before going to a party. Now receive daily collection calls.,21,M,tifu
"We live in two different countries, he's 24 and i'm 21. We were together for 2 years. I was completely, madly in love with him, i'm young and i know the whole, there's others out there, and you should just go and be young etc, but i honestly felt this was the guy -  and i still do :( 
 We're both depressed, i'm somewhere between trying to deal with life and get my education. He however were/is not, a thing i could easily accept and deal with, but it's a strain on him, and made him feel even more useless than he already did (due to being ill amongst others) 
 Eventually, a year ago now, he started pushing me away, and broke up with me. We got back together, but this breaking up/getting back thing went on for a long time. It hurt like hell, but i so wanted to be with him, and he really wanted that too.
I knew it was a bad idea everytime, but i also knew why he did it, him trying to ""save"" me from himself and stuff like that. He never felt he was good enough for me, that he only managed to hurt me or mess up my own life.. blabla. Trying to tell him otherwise changed his mood, but never how he felt. 
 Finally i had enough, like, months ago now (i don't even remember, it was just a confusing mess.) I broke up, after he had ignored for a week, i felt i had to take the steps in order to protect myself, life had already crashed on me, and i couldn't deal with this .. whatever we had anymore. 
 We just can't accept it, either of us. I think about him every day and vice versa. He's contacted me a lot of times since the break up. But knowing him, i tell him we shouldn't talk, because we'll end up trying again. 
 I  want  to try again, i want to be with him, i want this relationship to end when it  should  end, if that's what will happen, from growing apart or whatever. But i can't be with someone who wont move. 
 He wont seek help for his depression, he wont take meds, he can't deal with any education or job while he is like this, but that's really what he wants and needs. He just refuses the part where he can learn how to deal with his illness. It's frustrating and hurtful knowing this, about someone you love and know so well. 
 I just want him here, with me, and live together, play games and be silly together, be low when we're low, support each other, love each other, just be happy together.. because we are so fucking happy when we're together. He makes me feel so much more, and so alive! 
 Yet i have to accept we can't. He wont move mentally or psychically, and i have an immensly hard time accepting that. 
 What do i do :(? How can i move on.. should i just do what everyone has been telling me: wait off the pain and eventually i'll find new love? 
 And yes.. i'm young.. i know.. i still think this was real love.

"I was at work today (a random electronics shop) and this guy stopped by for some help. As he walks up to me with his phone he asks for my help to set up a google account, and I tell him I'll do it for free because I really didn't mind helping him (while it really is a 60$ fee on setting up a google account for customers, do not know why it's so expensive). So I start setting up his google account when 4 of my good friends walk in to the shop and they ask me if I wanted to come party with them.

"This was like last year during the school year.
So at the time I was 15, (Mind you I have the-most infant looking face in my whole grade) After school me and my friend walked home to my house, walk in the door bum our asses up the stairs and get the grass. A typical walk in walk out type of thing. We go to the park nearby my house, spark up, then my friend gets the amazing idea of going to a small Chinese food restaurant. Stoned me thinks its a great idea. We ride there on our longboards nearly eating shit 3 times. He places his order, I go to place mine, alright, food is done I get asked to pay... Reach in my pocket, Nothing but fucking lint. I say sorry to the cashier, go sit down next to my friend. Everything's fine just a human mistake. About half way into my friends meal, a ""stranger"" from behind me asks if she could buy me some food, I turn around like I was in a horror movie and mutter the words ""No."" She asks if I was sure, at that moment I realize that it was one of my teachers, literally as I was speaking ""I'm great."" my voice cracked. My friend then giggles like a goddamned school girl, he stops eating and we hightail out of the restaurant. He leaves, I go home. I walk through the door.

"Hey, /r/anxiety. Throwaway because... I don't know. And I don't know what I'm looking for exactly except maybe to talk about what's going on right now. 
 I (21f) live in Asia and I'm visiting home for the first time in 6 months. This is great because I'm not really enjoying my time here, I ran out of antidepressants 3 months in, and I've been sick off and on the entire time (sometimes with quite semi-bad fevers and respiratory issues). But I'm having some travel-related problems now. 
 Issue 1 : a few months into being here, BF and I got a puppy. He's fantastic. I love him. We adopted him from a young litter on the streets. He's a hassle but I think he does good things for me... until we learned more about the laws here. Long story short, if we don't register him he could be euthanized and we simply can't register him. So we decided he'd go home with us and stay with my mother. We're here for 6 more months after our visit home. 
 He's flying excess baggage and I'm fucking terrified. My poor puppy who loves me and relies on me and needs me will be alone on a plane for 13 hours. He's healthy. He should be fine. We talked to people who said this is OK but I'm scared and I feel sick. 
 Issue 2 : Packing. I hate hate hate packing. It's been an issue since I was a kid. I'd go to grandma's overnight and take bags upon bags of stuff ""in case I need it"". Obviously this is terrible with international travel. My suitcase is making me sick. Does anyone else have this problem? What in the world do I do? I feel like if I don't bring, like, all of my clothes, bad things will happen. If I don't bring all of my stuffed animals, I'll lose them forever. If I don't bring old writing or work notes or something I'll inevitably need them and hate myself for leaving it. 
 Issue 3 : Misc. anxiety. I'm scared of flying. Travelling is innately stressful. I already tend towards stress dreams and nightmares and have been having them so frequently I'm scared to sleep. I'm worried. I teach young children and I know my foul mood has to be affecting my teaching ability. I feel like I'm steps away from a huge breakdown where I'm literally screaming on the floor in the classroom or at random people on the subway. I'm scared that this is increasing my anxiety medication usage. I can't have any caffeine because it makes things worse even though I leave the house at 7:15 tomorrow morning and won't be back home for 12 hours, that many of those hours will be used teaching big classes of energetic elementary school-aged kids. 
 Tomorrow (it's night here) is my last day at work before the trip and the next evening we leave. I'm losing my mind. I keep having nightmares and I have to wake up for work in a little over 6 hours and my puppy keeps laying on my chest and licking me and staring at me with his sweet little face. 
 (To be clear, I'm highly in favor of therapy and would love to be back in therapy. I just live away from home and not many people speak English. Mental health stuff is also sort of frowned upon/disregarded. I  know  I need to get back to therapy. Not sure if I should find someone to talk to during my 2 weeks home, but I probably won't. I have shit health insurance and my former therapist is in my college town, far from my hometown so I don't have anyone I know.)","live abroad. Going home for a bit.

"I was doing some odd jobs at my Grans farm with my dad, I wasn't doing anything to serious as I was around 13/14 years old, just handing stuff to my him and carrying bits around.

"Ok so I am in my second year in school, and this is my girlfriend's first year in college at a big party school. She and I met in high school, and made it through our first year apart, and loved the summer together. We went on trips, and just really are great together. 
 However, since she has gone to school, she has changed. For one, her top priority are her new friends. She even told me the first week that her new friends mean more to her than I do because they are physically there and I am not. She cancelled plans on me for a football game because ""The seasons tickets were $190, of course that is more important to me on that day"". 
 The past few days have been good though, we have been happy.

We both joked that she would need to bring some water, as she would be out from 12pm to 2 am most likely, and would be drinking. Half an hour later, after we had gotten off the phone, I texted her saying that I was worried about this weekend, she asked why, and I said because she would be out drinking for 14 hours and I was just worried for her while she is out. She blew up. She started accusing me of trying to tell her what to do, trying to keep her from having friends and judging her. I explained to her that I was just worried about her, since there are jerks out there who she might come across who could harm her, especially on a campus while drinking. She then got even more mad, calling me Dr.""my last name"" and saying ""Thanks dad"" when I said I care about her a lot and worry about her well being.

"Hello ladies! 
 I come to you with a moral dilemma I am facing. Firstly, this is a throw away account. I'm just looking for any advice, experiences you may want to share, or your thoughts on the situation. This is my first time posting anything ever on reddit, and I know you are the kindest subreddit out there, so please help me out. I'll make this as short as possible, because no one likes a novel. ;) 
 I just graduated university with honours (yay!) and have begun my job hunt. I've found a bunch of companies I really want to apply to and finished writing my resume and cover letter yesterday. I used my university career help center for advice and editing, and I'm really proud and confident in my resume and cover letter. But given my young age (22 years old/f) and relative lack of experience working in my field of study, I'm worried potential employer will not even bother giving me an interview. 
 I'm extremely confident in my speaking and presentation skills, so I'm nearly sure that should I be giving an interview, I'd be set. (At least I'd like to think that, haven't actually had a single interview yet, so who knows, I may crash and burn gulp) 
 Which brings me to my dilemma. I expressed these fears to my mother and she suggested putting a small face shot of me on my resume. Her idea being that as a ""young pretty thing"" (her words), showing them what I look like might be the difference between getting an interview or not. 
 Now, I'm aware I'm fairly good looking. Maybe a 7/10? I'm by NO MEANS a model, or some stunning creature. But I am a blonde, blue-eyed, extremely busty (34-DD), 145lbs, 5'3 young woman. And believe me I have my fair share of insecurities about my body and my looks. But I'm also aware that with the right hair do, and make-up, I've turned heads walking down the street. 
 My field of study is extremely male dominated, and generally fully of SAP geeky guys. I myself am a total geek, a gamer, and frequent comic-cons dressed in my Star Trek uniform. But they'd never now that from my resume. 
 While I see my mothers point, that all I'm doing is using my advantages to get myself in the door, I still feel that I'd be getting the job because of my looks, rather than my skills. I feel like I'm setting feminism back 30 years and it makes me sick. I’ve worked my whole life to dispel the stigma that I’m nothing but a “ditzy blonde” and I had hoped my straight A’s in university would prove that. But at the same time, I want these jobs so friggin bad. And my student loans won't pay themselves. 
 To clarify, I'd NEVER flirt, dress provocatively, or act unprofessional during an interview. This is only about using my looks to GET the interview.

"It was my senior year of high school, I was accepted into my college of choice, graduating on time, and I had a wonderful girl friend. 
 One week a friend of mine that I worked with on a group project a while back in english class asks if he can stay at my house for a week. He hadn't been getting along with his mom all too well, and his parents were split. I really didn't know him all that well, but I couldn't just turn him down so I asked my parents and they said he could stay for a week. 
 What a week it was. The majority of the week he spent with us, he seemed like a little kid, maturity-wise. It was like watching an episode of some syfy show where a character lost his memory and reverted back to a child like state. I often felt like I was baby sitting him. 
 Later that week, he had a doctor's appointment at some clinic in the city. So, me and dad took him. Of course, this is the point where the doctor pulls us aside and asked us to make sure he was taking his meds, which was a cocktail of antidepressants and antipsychotics. About a half hour later, his mother met us at the clinic and the nice doctor asked his mom if she brought a change of clothes for him. At this point, she turned to my friends younger brother, and she asked him where his clothes were, he shrugged and pulled out a couple manga books of naruto (more important than clothes I guess). She continued to hammer him out with a barrage of angry words because her youngest son (he must of been 10 at the time) forgot to bring his older brother a change of clothes? 
 At this point me and my dad just looked at each other and both simultaneously gave each that look. That look, where your face just says, ""This bitch is crazy."" Honestly, the responsibility shouldn't lie on a child right? 
 My friend ended up staying the night at the clinic for observations, and the next day me and my dad went to go pick him up. When we arrived he was smiling, more than I had ever seen him before, especially in the last week where he was in a child like state. (He'd always been pretty angry, and depressing looking in class) He came towards us with his bag of stuffs, and he was holding something in his hand. It was a clay cardinal, not just some crappy clay cardinal; the cardinal looked like something you'd buy from the pottery barn and paint with your kids. And this well crafted pottery cardinal was mine, a symbol of his appreciation and also because he was very sorry for overwriting all of my saves across several games on my wii. 
 Later that day, my dad went down the street in our little suburban alcove to have a beer with the sheriff and share the strange happenings of the week. On returning, my dad was a bit different from before he left. I didn't read too much into it, and decided to go to bed. There I was slinking into bed, and there was something else unnerving. It was my closet. I didn't remember opening it. It's near pitch black and I knew I couldn't fall asleep with it open, so I sluggishly got out of bed to close it. When I was about three feet away from the closet, a great big darkness jumped out at me from the closet. Scaring all manners of hell out from me. If there was ever a moment in my life where I'd been the most afraid this is it. And I've fallen out of trucks while nearly being run over by oncoming trucks. Scared, and irate I yelled at him. My poor, dumb, troubled friend. He left my room ashamed, and I returned to bed falling into a slumber almost immediately with no thoughts on what had just happened, all I knew was that my closet, and my door was closed and that I was finally alone. 
 Morning came, and it was finally time for my friend to go home. My dad, called his house ahead of time to coordinate his arrival. He then coordinated with the sheriff. My friend, was packed and the three of us were off again. This time, heading somewhere sad. We arrived and there were police there(to mediate) my dad told me to stay in the car and walked my friend to his door. The car ride back home, was silent. Up until my dad finally broke the silence. He said in a low kind of clint eastwood -esque voice, ""It had to be done."" He then went to explain everything that I hadn't known about my friend. Everything my dad found out when he mentioned my friend's name to the sheriff that night. 
 My friend tried to kill himself on three occasions throughout high school. I never knew. The entire reason why he was actually staying with us, was because he began hearing voices again. They were telling him to hurt his family. He'd also seen some poor kid get his face stomped in on a curb, and had almost been charged with something. I just never knew any of this. I never imagined that beneath his silent exterior, there lied a sad, sad boy. 
 Half a week had passed I was a shut-in, and my girlfriend was irate with me for neglecting her the past 10 days. Another day passed, and it was her, my girlfriend's birthday, I wanted to explain the past happenings of my week to her. But it was too sad, and I ended up just telling her that I was just babysitting my friend. She hated my friend, she always did. The mere mention of his name moved her to anger. Then I realized that I hadn't gotten her a present at all, I'd been busy all week with my friend. I looked around my room and there it was, the white pottery cardinal that my friend gave me. It seemed good enough as anything for my woman. Of course, she didn't like the masterfully crafted unpainted pottery cardinal that my friend had just given me. More time passed, I stopped thinking about my friend as much. My girlfriend and I mutually broke up with each other around chirstmas time.

"warning: this is long..., but super serious idk what to do 
 Okay, my girlfriend (21) and myself (20) have been together for a year and 7 months... and we have the most onesided relationship (in my opinion).... but it's like I feel like i'm making excuses for putting up with this. 
 brief history: 
 I've never been the relationship type, when we first got together I was still sorta talking to a girl here and there, my current gf found out and i ended that. also, I've never thought that having a friend ship with my exes was bad... but my current gf does. So she'd get mad when one of my exes txtd me, though I would leave the convorsations in my phone so she could go through them.  
 I feel like this is all so extreme, she asks for my cell phone account info to log on and see if I'm lying to her about who I'm texting, she'll call numbers back that aren't in my phone. The other night after a night out, I pass out and she stays up and goes through every single thing in my phone, finds my passwords to my accounts and such, and looks through EVERYTHING, she did this until around 5 a.m. to find nothing. She always says the rudest things to me like I never do anything for her, and how I'm never there for her..... but I bend over backwards I drive 2 hours to her hometown everyweekend to spend time with her then leave 3 A.M. Monday morning to come back home and be home in time for work and the day. i used to be a really big gamer, and most of my time was spent playing some type of game, now I hardly ever touch any of my consoles, I'd say I play less than an hour a week if even. She calls me the shittiest things ever, things that she later uses the excuse of ""I was mad,"" or ""You made me say it."" and I can't bring myself to understand why she does this, cause I get really mad too, and have yet to call her a bad word or tell her that I hate her/regret us etc. 
 I think I just take every blow she throws at me cause I pass it off and make excuses for it. Like the whole phone ordeal/wanting the passwords to everything, I mean I messed up.. I did things she didnt like, so I have to suffer the consequences... and I would rather make her feel comfortable than be the douche and say no you can't have passwords/see my phone and seem sketchy. 
 And then I pass all the rude stuff off with the excuse of her depression and ups and downs. She lost her mom when we first got together due to breast cancer. The day her sister came running up to my car crying I knew that was a day that I had to choose whether or not I was going to stick through it with her through what was about to happen and her ups and downs (you can expect ups and downs especially when losing someone of that caliber) or leave. I made the decision to stay, I drove her to the hospital every morning before work and would go pick her up around 10 when visiting hours were over every night I'd lay in bed and hold her as she cried and would never fall asleep until she fell asleep first.... and I also to take every blow she's thrown at me. But I'm honestly tired of this......I feel myself and patience wearing thin.... she sees a therapist, she's on meds..... I've talked to her about how I feel countless times..... it's just becoming too much. 
 all my friends say I don't deserve it and sometimes I believe it, but it's hard to picture my life without her cause she's been here for so long...... I wouldn't know what to do.","my girlfriend goes through all my shit, and says some really shitty fucked up things to me, i make excuses for her and pass it off and continue to put up with her shit, but i'm tired of it.",20,M,relationships
"I M(28) just broke up with my girlfriend F(24) of 4 years. She moved across the country to be with me and we have lived together for 2 years. It started out great, but I've been unhappy for much of this time living together. We've tried for over a year to improve, I've gone to personal counselling for months to see what I can do. While she is great in many ways, long story short, I have become convinced that we are not right for each other. I ended it today, and no surprise that the breakup isn't going down easy. Breakups are hard, but she is also overly dependent in my opinion. Reading advice on other similar questions here seems to point to one thing; I should cut off or limit contact with her to make this quick and clean for both of us. However, I'm worried about some things she said, and I'm worried that she has no one to talk to or support her since her family is across the country and she has few friends here. First, she said something like, ""without you I have nothing to live for, I might as well go kill myself"". While I'm taking this seriously,  I'm not really sure how serious it is, and how I should respond to it.  Second, I figured she could at least go to her parents once the dust settles, but she told me that she can't contact them because of the disappointment and embarrassment. Her parents and I are her only support, as she currently has no job or savings. 
 Near the end of our breakup conversation, she said that she would leave immediately and that I would never see her again. Out of concern for her safety, I asked where she would go, to which she had no answer. Luckily, we have two separate living spaces, so she could stay there and we would not see each other, but she says she wont stay there. 
 I feel horrible enough for breaking her heart, but even worse that she has little to no support. I feel like I can't completely cut her off, and I'm worried about her safety.

"Sorta. I started dating my first girlfriend in the spring of our freshmen year. i was an UBER virgin and she had lost her virginity in middle school.

 ALL of the school just assumed that i was getting laid since I was dating this girl. We didn't have sex until our junior year of high school (we rounded ALL the bases often, just never hit home plate). I would constantly explain for those first two years we dated that we were not having sex, everyone would just laugh in my face. She knew that I was being honest and that was all I cared about.

 Christmas holidays are now over and it seems like I'm supposed to get a job. My thesis writing lasted for 2 years, because getting results from the project took a real long time. And before I could do my thesis, I had to write 6 reports in english about the report to a company that used them to get an CE-marking from EU-organization. 
 Looking back now, the project was too big for me to handle mostly alone, and it has taken it's toll on me. I had sleeping problems, self-destructive thoughts and and I still have sadness and anxiety during these 2 years.

"Throwaway, and I will say now that there are possible triggers in this, so be warned. I'd also like to say that this isn't a humblebrag post, I'm not some hero for following the rules of consent, but I felt this needs to be discussed and you ladies are a wonderful group to talk about this with. 
 I am using a throwaway because people I know use reddit. So you know, XX, 20s, single. 
 That said. 
 Tonight, I had the opportunity to rape somebody. 
 After I got off of work earlier tonight, I went to a nearby bar to have a (singular) beer and unwind before driving home. While there I ran into some other coworkers, a mix of other people not closing and one coworker who had not worked at all that night. The minute I laid eyes on him, I saw he was cross-eyed levels of drunk, and went into instant ""take care of"" mode because, well, at my place of business we all take good care of one another. 
 I drank about half of my beer and it was established by the two other coworkers and myself that we needed to get cross-eyed coworker home. Let's call him Josh for the purposes of this conversation. 
 Josh's house was about twice the distance between the bar we were at and the apartments of the other two coworkers. Josh and I have been friends and worked together for 4+ years. I know him quite well, and so while I would generally recommend against being alone in the middle of the night with a very drunk man who is much larger than you (I'm 5'7, probably 160, he's 6'1, probably 205), I need to stress that I know this man well, I've seen him this drunk before, and I know him well enough to know that this isn't going to be putting me in any physical danger. Disclaimer over. I dropped the other two off first because it made sense geographically. 
 I'm going to save some space and some of your time here by saying: What should have been 20 minutes to get him into his place and me on my way turned into an hour and a half ordeal of him not having his keys, getting a hold of his former roommate, getting his former roommate's keys, getting him back up to his house, etc. etc. It took about an hour to even get the door open and him through it. 
 Part of this whole process involved a lot of me putting his arm around my shoulder and nudging his legs with my knee to get him to walk. Each time this happened, he would pull me in close, and tell me how great I was, then how terrible I was, etc. Drunk person talk. I had zero doubts that I could get away from him if he were secretly an awful person who wanted more than to get home, but he was very... cuddly. Very complimentary on the whole if you know how to interpret his cross-eyed drunk ramblings. 
 I got him into his house, finally, pointed to a couch, and told him to sit down while I fetched him some water and lit him a cigarette. 
 This is where I chose to not be a rapist. 
 Josh and myself have always had a fun level of sexual tension. Once, about a year ago, we were both a few beers deep and kissed briefly, then totally BRO'D OUT ABOUT IT BECAUSE THAT'S WEIRD. I know that he thinks I'm attractive, he knows that I think he's attractive (because he's a fox), but we simply don't interact that way. It's not a coworker thing, we're just better as friends. 
 He was, LITERALLY, asking for it. Never mind that he was in a state where no man could ever sustain an erection and accomplish sex... He was asking me to come lay next to him, to kiss him again, to hold him, to let him touch me. Literally ""asking for it"", as rape apologists so gleefully say half of the time. And in a weird way (the way where he's very attractive, pretty much), it was very tempting. 
 The thing is this: None of this was consent. When he sobers up in a few hours, he may have no idea of how he got home and feel like shit, but he won't be waking up next to me, his friend, and having his mind race because I let him do what his drunk Id self wanted him to do. Were he to wake up next to me in a few hours, he would be horrified and full of shame and remorse. Had I stayed instead of hugging him goodbye, making sure he had the motor functions to get into his bedroom without my help, and leaving, I would have been a rapist, because consent when you know that that's not what they really want is not consent. 
 So. He's going to feel like shit tomorrow, but not for reasons worse than too much whiskey. 
 Consent is a huge topic on my mind lately, and it's interesting that such a poignant and perfect example to how ""shades of gray"" consent can be came up tonight. I thought I'd share, ask for similar stories maybe, and bring up the topics of not just consent, but female-on-male rape and how it is a very real thing that everybody needs to be aware of.

"Okay, so my Dad recently became heavy into Christianity. I'm 15 years old and consider myself a independent thinker, so like my personal beliefs are that over the average redditor. A little back story now: My mother is Jewish and my father is Christian. I was raised Jewish and had a Bar Mitzvah but at 14.5 I started questioning if I believed in a God and then at like 15 I came out about it. My dad was never a religious fellow until I was about 13.5 years old which was a year and a half after his dad died, which is a very traumatic experience with in itself.  It changed him.  I hate the new him, he believes everything he is told and it bothers me. What happened to the dad that would gaze at the stars with me and tell me how one day we would find life on other planets, or the guy who I could walk down the street with and would see 2 men holding hands and he would tell me it was perfectly natural? He now attends Church weekly and goes to a Men's Church group. He doesn't believe in evolution, gay rights or anything that in the bible says is bad but is now accepted as okay by the better part of society.  It's like the intelligence has been sucked right out of him. 
 Anyway, we were at the DMV the other day getting my Driver's permit and he just randomly shoots off 2 reasons why he believes in creationism. So being the natural redditor I am, I pull up /r/atheism on my phone and find a couple of pro-evolution posts that shut him up for the rest of the day. 
 My question to you reddit is how do I get him to stop being  SO SUPER  religious? I'm fine if he believes in Christianity because it comforts him about the loss of his own dad, but I would really like it if he at least got some of his intelligence back.  How do politely tell him that he is wrong? How do I prove to him that evolution is a real (whenever I show him a good fact, he responds by telling me they haven't found the link between man and ape so how could we come from them, or, if we evolved from apes why are there still apes)?

"Dear Redditers: 
 First off, this is a throwaway account, and also my first post on Reddit. 
 Second, ex-Digg lurker and big fan of the Reddit community and IAmA/AMA, so I thought I’d give it a try. 
 Now, for a little background (may help with future advice): 
 I live in a decent sized US city, and live with my two brothers and father. 
 In the middle of my quite average sophomore year of high school, my mother was diagnosed with late stages of Wilsons’s Disease and shortly after lost the fight. I remember it so vividly, my father (ex-Marine) bursting into tears, and just simply saying, “She’s dying.” We attempted to try and talk/say goodbye to her, but the sedatives she was on from the last surgery could not get filtered out by her failing liver. I never really got a chance to say “good-bye”, or “thanks for everything”. I was young and never really got to talk to her as an adult. I assume there is where some issues bloom. 
 Not much longer after her death, my father slipped into extreme alcoholism (runs in the family… yay!). After three DUI’s, three totaled cars, countless rehab stays, an eviction, and even multiple stays in jail, the man still cannot get straight, even to this day. His drinking has even led to a broken foot, which got infected and alongside diabetes, had to be amputated below the knee. Just recently (after buying booze), he was hit by a car and lost his finger (odd, right?). From this, we received a nice amount of cash (~$80,000) by settlement which is being spent on mountains of whiskey. 
 I am attending University for a major in History/Education, and am in my 3rd year. School for me is essentially free due to my low EFC, loss of parent, etc… But I hate it. I felt pressed to go to school by my outside family, and was made to believe it was my only way out of this trap of a city. This money should go to someone who would appreciate it more. School is turning out to be nothing more than paying for an old man to read me a Wikipedia article on the War of 1812, and for the school to clap and give me a piece of paper stating I listened well. This, along with my parenting issues, introverted brothers and overall high expectations from my family and even me, has led to depression and borderline anorexia (went from 330lbs to 180lbs). Most of my depression and other issues are easily dealt with through self-medication (habitual use of Cannabis), which also led me to a change of heart: 
 I realized that my life was turning out to be nothing more than an act to please others around me and to assure them I was okay. It was normal: go to school, get a job, house with picket fence. It was safe. After much time thinking about what I wanted to do, I thought to pursue music. Other than when I am high, the only other time my mind is free is when I am playing music. I was the drummer in my high school’s jazz band/drum corp for four years and am currently in a project with my friend(s). I am not doing music in the hope of making millions, I have read other band’s IAmA’s and as long as I can make a living, see the world and spread a positive message and hopefully reach kids who are also messed up/lost, I’d be happy. Now here is where I need to make a decision. So, Reddit, should I (A): Be safe and just stick with teaching (I do love History), or (B): Go for my real dreams/goals, but risk becoming a burn-out? (Big fear of mine!). I could easily get some start up money from my father via the settlement, which would allow me/we to move to a bigger city (was thinking Chicago).","IAmA Self-medicated/depressed 20 year old; Dead Mom; Alcoholic/Crippled ex-marine Dad; Thinking of dropping out of University to pursue music in a bigger city.

"I'm a soon to be graduate from a 4 year university in the states and have recently developed a pretty serious crush on a girl - enough to go looking for a subreddit dedicated to the topic. I guess you could say I'm getting a taste of my own medicine in a way for being a womanizer for so long, but man this shit is like a big ol' rock in my chest. I guess she saw me at a concert and we had already matched on tinder and she drunkenly said I was hot (turns out her friend did), additionally we had met previously but I didn't remember that. I take her out for some drinks, we both ended up blowing off our friends and she came back to mine. Usually self-loathing would ensue but damn man it was back to highschool shit trying my hardest not to text her. I broke and I texted her again the next night seeing if she wanted to hang out - she wasn't deflecting necessarily but wasn't super enthusiastic either. She invited me over as a response to me inviting her over again, but I asked if it was weird cuz she didn't seem brimming with excitement to see me (at least in the way that I was to see her). In response to me asking if that was weird she said ""extremely! no worries"". feelsbadman.jpg Next day was a big school-wide college party thing that she didn't attend but I did, and I was just thinking about her all day but again was forcing myself not to text her, but cracked, again. After the day party I was threw a party at my apartment and her and her friends came over, who turned out to be friends with my friends so that was cool. Everyone left, she stayed the night again. Being drunk I told her, ""I'm low key obsessed with you"" and I just remember some vague statement about her being like you're so smooth and respectful... and you know it too, insinuating that I wasn't being genuine.

Now, my background was pretty sheltered, loving family, good friends and people around, limited drug use, not much of a drinker, moral person... etc. 
 In October, we moved to his home town and I found out a LOT of stuff I just plain did not like about him. He dealt drugs, womanized, beat people up, drank, robbed, and partied lots.. His friends are all man-children, who still cheat on their girlfriends, drink/party until they can't even pay rent, etc. and they obviously encourage him to do the same. While we were there, he reverted back to a lot of that shit (minus the cheating, as far as I know)... and silly me had no idea what to do or how to react, as my previous boyfriends had always respected me and treated me pretty much like gold. 
 Fast forward to now, it has been about 6 weeks since we left there, by his own admission to save our relationship. I know that this is a big step and means a lot...(or does it? Am I just a gravy train?). Things are not going that well still, though, because it seems like we are still in a toned down version of the same...Here are two of the big ones: 
 He lies, and he is always bringing people from the past TO NOW. I've caught him in so many little lies about girls that are his ""friends"" texting/messaging him, then later find out they were semi-serious girlfriends... and he deletes the messages, which I HATE and have begged him not to do. Things like, ""oh, the boss said I didn't have to come to work today"" when the truth is he lied and said MY car wouldn't start... 
 Lastly, he is STILL acting a fool. He is the type that if I want to ""talk"", he immediately gets angry/defensive and leaves the room (disrespect?). It is especially bad lately, so I have been shutting down and he knows it. He even said he feels bad because he is ""changing"" me, I never smile, and he doesn't want to do that to me. However, despite me expressing to him that I don't like his lying, going out and partying when WE are now broke, hanging out with jailbirds at the strip club, etc. he still basically does whatever he wants... he even went so far as to look up some girls he had a threesome with to boast to his new work friends on my computer on Friday. But had the gall to get mad at me when MY friend told me about his public facebook status (I don't have fb) as it is ""his business"". 
 Long story long,  I feel under-appreciated, disrespected, depressed, and totally at a loss for what to do next.","Not liking who my SO [25/m] is becoming or seems to be, and don't like who he is turning me into… I'm afraid I'm stuck in his downward spiral.",26,F,relationships
"I was 22 and at a bar in Minneapolis. Playing pool with a couple guys who were from a bad part of the Twin Cities metro area. Shooting the shit with them and they were going on about how bad crime, drugs, etc., were in their neighborhood. I, on the other hand, was from an affluent suburb where everything's ""perfect"" (the city, Eden Prairie, has been no. 1 on Money Magazine's best cities in America list before). 
 Anyway, that's the context to the following exchange: 
 Black fella from bad part of Minneapolis: ""Yeah man, just the other day my sis got stuck up on her walk home from the bus stop (or something vaguely like that)."" 
 Me, being mostly facetious: ""C'mon, you don't even know what it's like in Eden Prairie. Just the other day, these coons were all over my dog. I had to tear them off. God damn coons are everywhere in my neighborhood"" 
 Dude gave me a look, picked up a pool ball and swung it right at my face, stopping completely before making contact. The look in his eye terrified me. 
 I looked at him like completely bewildered before it sunk in that that coon was a derogatory word for black guy. Apparently I was too bad of a student to remember by Huck Finn.

"I've always wondered how others were effected by Sir Terry Pratchett and the Discworld series so let's hear some stories :) 
 For me Terry Pratchett effected my whole life. From the age of eight my mother got me to read the Discworld series, starting with Pyramids, and from there it spiraled, I read all of his books and still do loving every second of them. At the age of eleven I realised that I wanted to follow in his footsteps and become a writer so I spent days writing, starting with poems, then short stories and then at 14 I finished my first book. 
 A vampire novel set on another world called Vampiric. Needless to say the book did not get published, released or was even very good but I kept writing until I had finished my next book, Black World: Instinct, a novel from a series similar to Kelly Armstrong's ""Women of other world"" series, about a Werewolf called Cadaras and his journey for revenge. This too did not sell or get published but I didn't give up because my sights were still set on Terry Pratchett. 
 Now, nearly a decade of hard work, sweat and tears my new novel Aerial Escape: Volume I - Where It All Began, a steampunk-esque series about a young aristocrat that becomes a skytraveller was released on kindle and has begun selling. I have contacted several agents and if I'm lucky this will be the one. 
 I never truly realised how much he gave me, he gave me a dream, a passion and an ideal to strive towards. Not only that but he taught me many great life lessons about people, the world and politics/religion.

"Okay so this summer I've taken the task of ""fixing"" myself. I don't know how long this post will be, but I'll try and give you a good idea about myself. 
 I'm 19, male, from India, went to the US last year for college. 
 I had 3 really good friends until 3 years ago. At that time, one of them moved to another state. I was still good friends with the other two. Then I met a girl, and right now she's my gf. I started spending more time with her, giving her all my attention (no exaggeration). In this process, my friends became repellent from me, started lying to me, and basically not treating me like a ""true"" friend. 
 In college, I did not have roommates and lived off campus. So I could not make any good friends (just the friends from the class that lasted 10 weeks). I tried to make a lot of friends. I listen to people, I reply. However, I'm not sure that my replies are good. More on that later. 
 I like talking to people, but I cannot judge people correctly. This one guy I thought was really good, actually stabbed me and I had a big fight with him. Happens to me a lot. 
 Now, on to the replies part. I don't know what is wrong with me. I talk to people. FB, whatsapp, on face when I see them. But the problem is, we chat for a day, and then no contact for weeks or months. I always start the conversation, so I feel that I should not be the one to message them again, or I'll come off as creepy. 
 I only have my gf in life, and yes I love her. But in the process of getting her, I have lost virtually everyone else. I have become anti-social: not in the way that I don't socialize, but that people do not like me for whatever reason. I am afraid of talking to girls, I don't know why but when I start talking to girls, I start rambling and blank out. I fin that I have nothing to talk to them about. 
 I feel that moving to the US was wrong, I could have stayed here attended a college, made friends and then went there. But what's done is now done. 
 Yes, I have tried things, I joined clubs in college, but the same thing happened. Everyone was nice inside the room, but didn't communicate outside with me. 
 Now to what I want. I want friends. Real friends, that I can share my secrets with, that I can hang out with. How do I do that? 
 PS: If you'd like more info, or maybe even want to chat with me to get to know me better and hopefully help me as well, please PM me. I'm desperate to fix myself.","Lonely guy, has a gf, needs friends.",19,M,makingfriends

"According to my mother, this happened when I was a wee lad, about 5 or 6. During primary school, the class would take bathroom breaks, there was a standard procedure, everyone would line up, and leave the classroom in a line, and then follow teacher in a line where we would stand outside the bathroom and go in batches to relieve ourselves. 
 But one time I was apparently dealing with a blunt or broken tipped pencil, now, the teacher had everyone in the class lined up, ready to go, but me. I had the cheek to tell her to hold on as I pared the pencil over the bin (TIL They are called sharpeners everywhere else but Ireland according to wiki, who knew.), then go back to my desk, test the pencil, it didn't meet my standards. With the whole class lined up and looking at me, I obliviously went back to the bin, pared it again, and test it again. Having then met my standards, I let her know that she could go.","I was apparently a cheeky little shit

"I've been having sex for approximately 9 months and have been in a steady relationship for over a year and a half now with my boyfriend [18]. Until a month ago, we only used condoms, but my GP put me on the Noriday pill and I've now been taking that as well as using condoms. 
 As a side effect to taking the pill, my period has now been almost non-stop for a month and a half (my GP said to stick with it for the 3 months because they might regulate - or disappear - near the end of this course). Anyway, I've always had sex on my period and so have continued to do so. Recently, I've found that my period will die down, I'll have sex and it will come back in full force as soon as he pulls out. This also leaves me with an uncomfortable feeling in my stomach that isn't painful, but quite intensely uncomfortable. My boyfriend thinks I might be less wet during sex - could this be the issue here? There's been a little bit of a decrease to my libido, but not enough for me to not want to engage in sexual activity - more that I want to less often in a day. 
 In the last few days, my period seems to have died down a little, but I'm now experiencing a brownish-yellow discharge. No odour or pain/itchiness though. 
 Basically, can anyone offer me any advice as to what's going on? Have any of you experienced something like this? If so, what did you do?","Started taking Noriday pill a month ago.

"This bullshit gets me more angry than just about everything. 
 For reference, I'm a 20 year old guy. 
 Almost all of my younger cousins are female. As is my duty as an older cousin I'm often asked to babysit. I'm fine with this as my little cousins are awesome. 
 One day I'm at the park with my four year old cousin, watching her play in a sandbox with other kids when it begins to rain. So knowing that she can't run fast I simply pick her up and begin to walk to the car. She starts to cry because apparently she has never had as much fun in her life as she did when she was in that sandbox. Some lady sees me carrying off a crying child and decides that I am obviously trying to kidnap her so she runs over and starts yelling at me. By this time the rain is really starting to come down so I ignore her and continue walking. 
 This apparently threw the woman for a loop as she got in front of me and tried to take my little cousin from me. 
 Being a rational person I shove the fuck out of her and put my little cousin into the car and drive off. 
 Skip to ten-minutes later when I'm at home and cops knock on my door. Turns out the woman had followed me home and called the cops. 
 Over the next hour I had to tell the entire story no less than four times. The entire time the woman is standing in the background yelling profanities at me.

"Hi. I am guy in late 20s, bit introverted, decent looking. I never had a girlfriend - it is my lifetime problem, that is literally preventing me to progress in life and keep me motivated and healthy-minded. Back then, when I was studying I had quite a few chances but thanks to me being shy, inexperienced or too picky I never made it...
Since I didnt finish university, I was later unable to find a good job, and I am doing pretty much anything was is around ever since, working mostly in a warehouses. As I got older, there were less chances to meet girls and few years ago I relocated to the Netherlands because of work and I am still there. One day, all the frustrations accumulated and I said enough!!! I will not wait anymore, not in the age when many other guys are already married or at least have many sexual experiences, while I was still almost untouched by a girl. I booked hotel and beautiful high-class escort girl... it was as good as I expected, if not better. I had what I was always dreaming about in a second and without any effort. I finally knew how does it feel to have a sex with beautiful girl and afterwards we had a great chat about all kinds of things, everything was perfect.
Soon I booked her again... then I booked her friend from the same agency, and another friend and then I booked black girl, older woman, bigger woman... all kinds of women! I tried new things in sex, not all dates were good, but most of them yes, and I became little bit more confident and also experienced but it still didnt help me to find a normal relationship.

I have my hobbies... metal, tennis, gym, photography, beer... but all that seems unimportant because the only thing that can give me some real joy, and pump some fresh blood to my veins, are escorts. I am even close to falling in love with my favourite escort girl, even though I know 100% that while she is very nice to me, she only likes my money and there is no chance to develop normal relationship with her. I simply tasted sex and now I cant live without it. I am almost 30, and if I continue like this, I will soon be old, lone, peniless and frustrated bastard, because those dates are short and soon after there is a frustration that I have to wait another couple of weeks for another date and that in reality no one care about me, that I have it only paid...

"I'm currently in high school. I've had a couple relationships(Upwards of ~8 months each) in the past, but I've never made that 'first connection' in any of them. 
 All the girls I've dated so far, I've known from classes, sports, or similar activities; starting that initial conversation hasn't been a problem in the past. Also, I've never been the one to start crushing on someone else. For example, in my most recent relationship, my (ex)girlfriend first confronted me about her taking interest in me, that relationship lasted 9 months.

"I tried weed at the tail-end of high school and reacted poorly to it. For whatever reason, it gave me vertigo and made me throw up. I tried it a few more times. I attempted to ease myself into it by only smoking the tiniest bit. It wasn't enjoyable so i'd smoke more and more until I threw up again. I stayed away from the stuff until after graduation. 
 When I was 20, one of my best friend's little brother died unexpectedly. The day of the funeral me, him, and a couple of our friends were sitting around in his apartment, waiting to go over to the funeral home. It was like 9AM. One of the guys pulls out a dutch and starts operating on it (or whatever weed-smokers call it), filling it with weed. 
 After it's ready, the dude lights it up, puffs on it a bit, and it begins its journey around the circle. It got to me and I was about to pass it without smoking. I look around, though, and the guys are comforting our friend, saying little things to make him smile. I didn't want to ruin the moment, so I take the most gentle of tokes and pass it on.

I'm tingling everywhere, but in a good way. ""This is absolutely great!"" I think to myself. 
 Anyway, I stay pretty baked for the next few hours. It was a wonderful feeling. I continued to smoke this weed thrughout the summer. Not everyday, just when that particular friend came around. At the end of the summer, he comes around with some different shit. Says he can't get the stuff I had been smoking for the past few weeks. I try the new stuff. Within half an hour, I'm dizzy and throwing up. I ask him what's so different about this new weed versus the other.

"Before/after pics with health stats]( 
 I'm 30 years old. Woke up one morning and was sick of being so large. So I spent a week coming up with a diet and exercise plan that would work for me. I began June 7 2014. Today I've officially lost exactly half of my body weight. I went from 424 to 212 pounds. 
 Happy to answer any questions anyone has. I also have detailed information on all of the food and exercise I've been doing. 
 I'm still losing weight, and I've now begun consulting with plastic surgeons for excess skin removal. Unfortunately, the procedures are expensive so I suspect I'll be stuck with sagging skin for the rest of my life. But even keeping that in mind, I feel a million times better. 
 Edit 1:

Note that it is ever-so-slightly out of date. I’ve really adopted the clean eating mentality. So I no longer buy almond milk for my morning shake – I actually make the almond milk myself from scratch. I also no longer buy protein bars – I make my own using whole ingredients. Otherwise it’s pretty accurate to a typical day.

 Edit 4:  This response was very unexpected. You guys are great! Thanks for all the support and kind words! Seriously, you're all making my day. 
 Edit 5:  I really have to let you guys know how touched I am at the response this post received. I'm sort of shocked at the Internet today in terms of how kind everyone can be. I'm really happy that the information is useful to a few of you and I really do hope that you see something here which inspires you to continue working towards your goals. I'm going to go to bed tonight feeling a bit better about myself and it's thanks to all the positive support I received from you all today. Thanks again! 
 Edit 6:  I've gotten lots of questions about exercise. Here's the deal. When I started, I did not want to exercise, but I did. I would walk on a treadmill 3 times a week for 20 minutes each time. That was all I could muster. I slowly began working up to very light jogging. After 3 months I got lazy and would only jog once per week. That ""once-per-week"" routine followed through for another 5 months. So if you want to begin losing weight, know that it truly starts with diet. Exercise will help improve your health, but it won't create massive calorie deficits for you when you are very overweight because your body simply can't handle all the activity. For months I was pulling 4-6 pounds of weight loss per week with only getting on the treadmill one per week. Then I went out an bought a FitBit Charge HR. It made me competitive with myself and want to be more active. I wanted more steps and active minutes etc. So I began running jogging regularly. Then I began running. Then by April of this year I began running before work and after work every day. By May I was running 5K a day. In August I stopped running twice a day because it was too time consuming (I work ten hour days). So now I basically run 7 MPH before work for approximately 20 minutes. I do a walk through my office building twice a day and a walk around the massive parking lot at lunch. That gives me about 13000 steps during work days. On days off I will do a 30 minute run at 7 MPH on top of whatever movement I get through housework/errands/etc. I routinely hit 15000-25000 steps on my days off. Long answer but my point is that exercise, while important for your health in many regards, is not the major component needed for weight loss. Diet is going to be responsible for 80-90% of pounds lost at the scale each week.",I did exercise. Very little in the beginning. Now I run daily,30,M,loseit
"EDIT: Genital Herpes HSV-2 
 Help me r/relationships. You're my only hope! 
 Ok seriously, I think I have the worst luck in love. I was talking to two guys and went on a first date with both, call them Bob and Billy. 
 Bob was cute, albeit a year younger than me (27). Mature, smart, on track with life. But he seemed stubborn, cocky, had this thing about ""winning."" But I could tell he had a big heart. 
 Billy is handsome, mature, established in life, patient, kind, amazing. We fucking clicked in all ways through text and in person. Made out on the first date, things got kind of frisky. 
 WHICH BRINGS ME TO - the day after, we were talking about our past relationships, flirting, still clicking. He tells me in a past relationship, his ex was horrible to him and cheated on him several times. He comes to find out he contracted herpes from her. 
 Cue my silent ""oh"" on the other end of the text convo. He was very light about the whole thing and said I am more than welcome to ask him as many questions about the topic as I wanted. He said he's since then had a few relationships and they never contracted anything. He also said he hadn't had an outbreak in over 6 years. He also said I can't get anything from kissing or the little we did do (I went to planned parenthood after our convo and they didn't look worried at all). 
 I was freaking out. I was calm through text and such and doing my best to be understanding, but it broke my heart. I was leaning more towards this guy. 
 Literally after finding that out, I started crying when I left to go get gas. When I came back, I realized maybe I wasn't ready to date (this is the kind of risk you take when dating) and told both men I just wanted to be friends at this point. Bob was totally fine with it, said if we ended up a couple or not, just to go with the flow. Fine. Billy is respecting the friend boundary, but at the same time, we can't help flirting still. I'm going to do my damnedest to keep it platonic in person at least. 
 I am still SUPER attracted to Billy. It's just so easy talking to him and we have amazing chemistry. I just don't know what to do! He's been amazing, told me he'd go to planned parenthood or a doctor with me to discuss this whole thing if it would help me feel comfortable. I'm seriously at a crossroads. 
 Should I continue this friendship thing and take things super slow? Should I cut this off? Has anyone had experience with this thing and what is your advice?

"Hello there. I don't really know what to say, or what anyone else can say to make it better. 
 I'm just sitting in my bed, soaking in my own tears, thinking about what could have been done differently, and dwelling on everything I've lost. 
 My  boyfriend  ex-boyfriend and I started dating just over a year ago. Before that, we were close friends for a while. Before that, I was actually recovering from my first ""real"" breakup. 
 We worked really, really well together. His family all loved me, our friends were basically all the same anyway... It was perfect. I was at his house so often that we decided that I would move in. 
 That worked well for a long time. We ""played house"". We acted well above our own ages- I fell in to the role of ""wife""; cooking, cleaning, taking on most of the household repsonsibilities. For a while, he pulled his weight; he'd be outside gardening our huge garden whilst I was spending hours preparing a beautiful meal. 
 We went fishing together, camping together. Family BBQ's, nights out with friends together. We hosted parties and attended parties together. We had our own time, too... But we always ended up back in the same bed together. 
 Eventually, as you can imagine, I started feeling sour about playing wife. I'm  19  for goodness sake. I'm not ready to settle down and accept that ""this is it"" for the rest of my life. 
 So, I started asking for change. Things like helping me cook dinner, or help with the dishes. It'd happen for a few days, then he'd forget again. 
 As I grew more and more bitter, I started noticing little things about him that I'd either ignored or found charming before. I realised that sometimes he was quite rude. Some times he was quite needy. 
 For the rest of the time though, it was wonderful. Unfortunately, I asked for change for so long, and was pushed for so long that one day I just snapped. My feelings changed. 
 Then,  everything  made me feel bitter. The way he'd ask me for a back scratch, like as if he deserved it even though I'd been making dinner for an hour. Or even just the way he would call me pointlessly to ""kill time"" while he walked to his car after work. 
 I started to become toxic, and nothing I did could change it. I moved out (back to my mums place), hoping distance would help. It didn't. 
 Last sunday, I finally cracked and told him it was over. We decided to be friends. He took me out for dinner tonight, and I realised he still thought that we would end up back together, he  still  thought I was the one and only girl in his life; the one he would marry. 
 I realised that ""being friends"" was giving him false hope. That while he was waiting for me to love him again, all I could think about was how irritating he was. 
 I know that I feel this way because of how long I tried and tried and tried to make things work, to the point where I know I am no longer  ok . I'm concerned about my mental health. But still, I feel so terrible for him. We have been each others best friends for so long, and even though I asked him so many times to work on things, he just never really understood. 
 I told him tonight that it wasn't fair of me to leave him thinking that we might get back together, and that we shouldn't see each other. He begged and pleaded. I sobbed my little heart out. 
 All I want is to drive back to his house and tell him I'm sorry. I love him, and I don't know why I feel so negatively about him... But I think he just lost his chance to prove himself. I know in my head that I need to move on, but my heart wants nothing but him.

"I'm 24, and being the oldest of 10 myself, I can tell you that all those things are not possible.
My dad can and always has supported his family, and after moving to Canada from The Netherlands has a pretty good bank account. 
But the only father son time I had was when I worked with him. 
My sisters have hardly any relationship with him, and my 2 younger brothers (14 and 11) don't have much of a relationship with him either because it now takes to much time to 'train' them in the work. 
Note that there was never any child labor but my parents were always renovating since before I was born, thus I grew up in it and always wanted to help. Now that my dad has his own reno company, not much gets done at home thus my brothers didn't grow up in it. 
 My dad isn't there for school events or any other activities, he works ~80+hours/week. If anything is broken though, especially mechanical like cars, he will fix it. 
 The oldest girls raise the little ones, but are not given any authority by my parents so no punishments can be given. 
 Social impact on the children varies by personality. I am somewhat of an introvert and the way I was raised amplified that. My younger brother (22) is an extrovert and the things that are holding me back, give him a line that he can choose to cross if needed. 
I can't find the words to describe it perfectly, but I'm trying to say that religion is never the only reason people grow up into who they are. Their own personality plays a part as well. 
 I know some of you will say that my dad is a horrible father and what not. And I agree that he is not the best dad, but when you really need him he's there, even if he doesn't have the answer. 
And that I do respect about him. As well as his ability to keep the family afloat financially. 
Being a father of 2 myself now I will never go to him for parental advice,  even though I am starting to understand him much better, but I will go to him for financial help. 
 One last thing. My dad did teach me to work, and I have always outshined my co-workers at the different jobs I've held.","No you can't do everything you want with 10 kids. Something(s) will have to give.

"A little back story first: I have a long history in the service industry and while it is no longer my primary job, I still pick up shifts bartending and serving from time to time. This happened about two weeks ago at a fancy dinner in a fancy club for the International Food and Wine Association. Just a small gathering (30-ish people) of a local chapter. 
 I'm serving passed appetizers, a delightful mix that includes lobster arancini. Now, having a good background in Italian food, I know how to pronounce arancini, and am required to do so as I walk around and name all the appetizers for each guest who inquires. These people obviously know their shit, being food and wine enthusiasts, so I'm careful to pronounce everything correctly. Hey, I may only be a temp, but I take pride in my service. 
 Enter lady in green satin, obviously late to the party, rushing in the door in a flurry of haste. She looks at me like I've grown a third eye when I pass too close to her while entering, but it's a small room and I'm obviously not trying to offer her appetizers as she's looking for the coat room. I think it's important to mention here that she is probably late forties to early fifties, one of the youngest of the bunch. Most people in the gathering are in their late fifties or older. 
 When she finally deigns to accept an appetizer from me I name the selections, including the lobster arancini. At which point she looks at me, and loudly asks ""The what?"" To which I repeat: ""Lobster arancini,"" and the other items. Now, I'm not looking down my nose at anyone who doesn't know how to pronounce the word (it's with a CH, not a soft c) but this woman then scoffs a little, and loudly says ""Ahh-ran-SEE-nee?"" to correct me in front of everyone else. And then makes me repeat it to make sure everyone knows she is correcting me. It's more degrading than embarrassing, which is what I really object to, and why we're progressing to my petty revenge instead of me just letting it slide. 
 So, flash forward and everyone sits for the meal. And, you guessed it, the lady in green satin is at one of my tables. Everyone else at this particular table is older than her, and is an equal mix of women and men. I'm dreading the rest of the food and wine presentation, when I realize I have a golden opportunity. Etiquette can have a lot of nuances (and I'm not here to argue all of them) but generally speaking, when serving dinner, it is polite to serve the eldest lady first as a sign of respect. Also, while fancy, this atmosphere was relaxed, so it's nothing that I, or the club, would get looked at twice for disregarding. So I took delight in serving this woman everything first the entire evening (with proper order for everyone after.) Of course, the guests would not be able to say anything, but I'm sure they noticed.",a woman tried to embarrass me in front of an audience so I subtly called her old the rest of the night.,47,F,pettyrevenge
"She's hurting me, a lot. Both physically and emotionally. I was diagnosed with a panic disorder and depression near the beginning of our relationship and hearing someone say that I had both issues, which I was in a bit of denial about kinda crushed me. I've recovered since then, but it's been a bit slow. 
 Now, I've made mistakes in our relationship, I won't deny that. She wanted to spend my birthday with me but I planned over her plans to have some international friends fly into the states to see me. It was an accident, I had forgotten she told me. I feel terrible about it. This happened eight months ago. She still brings it up minus the countless apologies and things I've done to make it up to her. My parents at the time ( I was 16 ) told her she couldn't come over to see my while my friends were there. This is because the first night they came over we got in a bit of an argument. She then called me a ""retard who just flips shit every few seconds"" (referring to my panic attacks) ""a drug addict""(referring to my anti-depressants, I've never done drugs in my life) and that she could ""do so much fucking better than me anyway"". This hurt me a lot, and after my parents heard it they said she couldn't see me that week. 
 Anyway, step a bit into the future, I ask her to go to homecoming. After asking, a few weeks later I find out I'm not going to be in town during homecoming. I gotta go to a wedding. She freaks out, says she hates me, tells me to kill myself despite it not being my fault. After I got back is when the hitting started. Often when she gets mad at me, she hits me close fisted in the head, slaps me, scratches and bites me. 
 A lot of this started well before the whole birthday thing. Just, nothing physical. 
 I've talked to her about it so many times and she just finds ways to blame me until I threaten with breaking up. She then says she will change and so on, and so far she hasn't. I don't know what to do because she just doesn't have anyone besides me. She doesn't have anyone to go to.","Girlfriend is abusive after and before mistakes I made, yet made up.

"So, I've never been in this situation before. My wife of almost 5 years (known each other 7 years). Left the house on Friday night with our daughter and is staying with her parents saying she needs space. I'm going to admit, I fucked up. 
 We both have stressful jobs, a new house, a 3 year old, etc. etc. normal middle class working family things. We both neglected work around the house, I did because I didn't want to deal with it and she didn't do it because she was too overwhelmed. Last Friday night, I was going to BBQ and needed some help getting the food ready but the problem was, nearly every dish in the house was dirty. Well, I flipped my shit and didn't stop. Basically saying things like 'Why cant you do this, nothing ever gets done', etc etc. Fight lasted about 10 minutes, daughter was crying and she got the fuck out.  I never have or will hit her.  Later that night she texted me saying she needs space to come to terms and see if she wants marriage. I freak the fuck out (didn't communicate this to her, just by myself freaked out). She said she would call me on Saturday and send pics of my daughter to me (never did) and that should would come home Sunday to talk things through (she didn't). 
 I ended up going to her parent's house on Sunday, no resistance from her parents. I got to see my daughter, even took her for the day, in my wife's car. Talked with the wife and basically she needs space, needs to reevaluate her life, etc. I said ok, fine, no problem. But I can't hold it together, I broke down in front of her. We talked for about an hour. I feel as though I got my point across that I'm willing to accept blame, move on and have no problems giving more help. She didn't make fun, she didn't insult me, just said to give her time. Also, I have not fought her on anything, I haven't tried to argue and say she's wrong, I have accepted all blame and told her I'm changing for the better of our family. 
 I really honestly believe that if she is given space for awhile, I agree to change and help more out around the house (easing her stress), she will take me back. I've agreed to a maid twice a month, helping her with her work at home (that stuff isn't bothering to me), taking on more work around the house. Most of the house looks like it's showroom quality at this point, I txted her pics to show her I'm giving an effort. I would like her to get with a different company for a job, I'm going to suggest that after everything settles. One that's a better work environment. Yesterday, she was still wearing her wedding band and engagement ring. This morning she texted me but it was relating to out daughter. At least there is still communication...? 
 We have a Thursday dance class for our daughter and she asked me to come and we would go get coffee after. I am worried about the fact I called her on Saturday (because I never got a call from her) and I broke down on Sunday in front of her which I was told makes me look weak. She told me she wasn't sure if she still loved me but I  hope  that was just her being angry. Also, Sunday, our daughter wanted to go to lunch and have mommy come. She was really addamit(sp) about it, for about 15 minutes. I called her and she no, she wants space and hung up. I guess that was really stupid of me. Also, her dad hates me (I'm the world's biggest piece of shit, etc.) but the mom likes me. I don't think that will matter but they are in the same house so that makes me feel uneasy. I went to write a letter that I want to give her on Thursday but it's turned into 3 pages and I'm not sure if I should give it to her. 
 I am beyond scared at this point because she means everything to me and I was stupid and really fucked things up. She's been giving me signs on and off that she is unhappy. I tried small things like activities, dinners, zoo membership with our daughter. Which she said were awesome but the at home stress combined with work stress is the main issue.

"Let's put this into context, we met because of a mutual friend, we started to like each other pretty fast (We are both introvert persons, so that was really cool) and a week after our first ""date"" we had sex.

"I'm 18 and she's 17. We've been in a relationship for little over 2 years now. On Friday I suggested we should go and have lunch on Sunday, and she told me she was craving crab. She then told me it would cost $50+ for that dish and I reluctantly agreed. 
 Fast forward Saturday night, I really did not want to pay that much for $50 because I personally believed it was ridiculous. I thought she was being extremely inconsiderate because she wasn't understanding my perception on this. She said things like ""Am I not worth going on an expensive date once in a while? The one time I ask you to eat an expensive lunch with me you shoot it down. Thanks for ruining my birthday week (her birthday is on the 15th of August). I apologised because I did not want to continue arguing with her. She told me to forget about the outing. 
 On Sunday she tweeted about how she still wasn't forgiving me, and in retaliation I texted her that ""I wasn't even at fault"". We argued about some semi-related things and then as a serious suggestion I said, ""Can we get a mediator like Wendy or someone"" and straight after that I asked ""What is birthday week anyway? Do you celebrate your birthday for seven days? I don't know what is."" She flipped out and said ""why the fuck would you want to bring other people into our fight"" and I suggested it because quote: 
 ""I wanted to know if I was the only one that felt that way [about the price of the food and my reluctancy]. I did not realise you would be so offended by this. It's just like talking to Nathan [at good friend of hers that she would talk to, about relationship problems with me].""

"Backstory: We are getting married soon.  I am 27M she is 22F.  We have been dating for 3.5 years, engaged for 1. Recently, my fiance's old best friend, well call her Stacy(22F), messaged her and said she was upset with her because Stacy recently found out a few months into dating me, my fiance was flirting and cheated with a guy we both know, well call him Frank(23M), and she couldn't believe my fiance would do that and she needs to confess that to me before we get married. 
 My fiance called me up, told me this is what Stacy said, and started crying saying she would never ever do that, and can't believe Frank who works together and is close with Stacy would make something like that up.  I believed her. 
 Recently, my curiosity got the best of me and with the wedding being so close I figured I would just make sure I check everything out so down the road I don't regret anything.  Knowing my fiance's facebook login, I checked her messages from this time, about 3 years ago, and found conversations of her and Frank flirting, calling each other husband and wife, and at one point her saying she is mad at him, he better make it up to her, and to get creative. 
 Now I don't know who to believe, my fiance or the story Frank told Stacy.  I would assume that if something did actually happen, my fiance wouldn't tell me that Stacy accused her of this, unless she was covering her bases.  I also don't know how to bring this up because I only am doubting my fiance by reading her facebook messages. 
 This was 3 years ago, and they stopped talking since I moved back home shortly after (had a long distance relationship), so if it was a thing, it definitely did end, but it still makes me question trusting her.  She would always ask if I was ok with her going to hang out with Frank, and I said it was always fine because I assumed if she was going to do something she would do it anyways.  Frank also has a history of depression and mental health problems, so him lying to Stacy is not out of the question.","3 years ago fiance (gf at the time) may have cheated on me, found flirting messages in her facebook inbox from that time, not sure how to bring it up.",27,M,relationships
"I wonder if the kind of attention given to a disabled friend is similar to that a person gives another if they are showing romantic interest. 
 Especially in my younger years, the compassion and willingness to help has often put me on the wrong track, making me believe a girl had a crush on me, while, in reality, she was just treating me like a disabled friend.

"So the other day we had a big argument over a bunch of stuff the other day. We never argued and we ended it on a happy note but it left a bad taste in my mouth from things that were said. I want to talk about it with her but really don't want to push it if I don't have to. We are young, she just turned 18 and I am 20, we've been dating since I was in high school. 
 For context this last year my girlfriend came to terms that she is bisexual and I had already figured she was but she had to realize it herself. I don't mind I love her for who she is but because of this she wants to experiment with the same sex. The thought of her with anyone, male or female, kind of makes me sick to my stomach. So to help her get experiment and I feel a little more comfortable, we are trying to have a threesome, even though honestly it's not something that I want to do but I'm doing it for her. Also we haven't had sex yet. We've tried what little chances we had because of her vigilant parents. And we kind of found out she has a biological problem that needs to be fixed with surgery. However she doesn't have the money to get it done. 
 So I said we wait till that's taken care of. She feels kind of incompetent because of it but I am not putting pressure on her because we can do other stuff. I don't care. I just love being with her. But the other day she brought up the threesome and who we could bring in and I said well we can't really do it till we've been together for awhile. And she kind of outburst asking why and I thought it was obvious but I told her because I would be having sex with a stranger and I don't want to lose my virginity like that. Maybe if I wasn't in love or with her, I'd be okay with it. But not now when I am in love and in a relationship. It makes me feel uncomfortable. 
 Then she says ""it's just sex"" and that's where it left a bad taste in my mouth. And I explained to her what I said in the previous paragraph. And she started telling me that's old school and no one is like that anymore and I shouldn't think like that and to hear think like that kind of grossed me out. I get that kind of mentality when you are single. And to me it devalues a lot of things that should be special and sacred in a relationship, especially a long term one.

 So there's this girl that I am very attracted to and have a HUGE crush on. Me and her are both in 12th grade and we had a couple of classes together last semester. 
 I always thought that this girl had feelings for me because she sat right behind me in English class and she occasionally touched my back/shoulders area and once even wrote something on my hand with a marker, among many other things. She also sometimes engaged in conversation with me but I nonchalantly brushed her off (IM SO DUMB!) numerous times because I got nervous. I was never 100% sure that she liked me back though because some days she just completely ignored me and gave me no signs at all, which honestly confused and depressed me a bit. So basically that's why I didn't say anything because I feared rejection and didn't want to make everything awkward. 
 Now I'm a pretty shy person,  especially  with girls, and I am truly terrible at flirting and getting intimate. But that's not even the worst part.

"Okay, so I have been dating and looking for a girl to have a serious relationship with for a little over a year now. It took until about a month ago to find anyone that I saw potential with. So this girl and I have been seeing each other for over a month now - 24M/23F. We recently made things exclusive after seeing each other and staying together almost every night for weeks. 
 So far, she has been everything that I was looking for. She is nice, has a sense of humor, I am very attracted to her, just an all around cool girl. I like to know what I am getting into when I am in an actual relationship, so there are generally a few questions I ask before I allow myself to really get attached. 
 Well, first of all I found out that she had been engaged up until almost a year ago and that she had been the one to break it off because she did not believe she would be happy for the rest of her life in that relationship. I was glad to know she had been the one to break it off, and this didn't bother me. 
 Now she is the type of girl that likes to go out with her friends and get quite drunk typically about once a week. I have a job that requires me to work weekend nights about 6 weeks out of every 18 so I am not always able to go out, and have not been able to with her on a weekend yet. 
 I have no problem trusting a girl that goes out and drinks without me, no relationship can survive properly without trusting the other to be able to go and have a good time. But it is always good to know, and one of the questions I ask is if the girl has cheated before. I once made the mistake of dating a serial cheater and I swore to never do it again. Well, I asked her and she said that she had only cheated one time before and it had been on the guy she was engaged to several months before she ended the engagement. 
 She seemed very upset/regretful about it. She said it was a huge mistake and she didn't want me to think she was a bad person because of it. I had told her that honesty was important to me before, and she had said she wanted to be honest about this. I understand she easily could have kept it from me. She said she learned from it and would never do it again. Apparently it was because of her unhappiness in the relationship which led to the eventual breakup. Now obviously this is still a little concerning to me, especially with someone who goes out a lot. 
 I really like this girl, and I see in her more potential than really anyone that I have dated so far in my life. I want to trust her, and I could eventually see this going somewhere. It's just that I am the first serious boyfriend since that incident and I don't want to get too far ahead of myself if I have a chance to prevent something early in the relationship. I would be really upset with myself if I allowed the same thing to happen to me. What do you all think? Does the whole ""once a cheater, always a cheater"" still apply to someone who has done it only once and seems very remorseful about it?

The language, Oh god I wish I had someone to speak it with again, the culture, the people. But we both decided to end it as it was just too much to deal with a relationship that long distance (I live in the US). And cue depression. I figure it is normal for people to get upset after a break up so I thought nothing of it. I just figured I'll get over her like everyone before her. I knew she wasn't happy either. We tried talking after that but it was just really awkward and then I completely ruined it a few months late by getting drunk almost every night and sending unbelievably stupid messages to her that were insulting, pathetic, and just completely disappointing.  after that we just didn't talk. That was even harder for me. She was my best friend before we ever considered dating. So.. life goes on. I went to college. Dated one other person. just one. I broke it off with her, I just wasn't interested in being around people. but I still was extremely upset. It wasn't over her anymore. I just was extremely depressed. I wanted to travel again so badly. But I couldn't go to Denmark again, I just.. I don't know how. My grades started failing. I didn't care. I just let it happen. It wasn't that I partied or anything. In fact, I hate being around people, part of the reason why I am posting on here. Really I would just get drunk by myself in my dorm while my room mate was out because I didn't even really like to talk to him. Now mind you, if you see me, I'm not that weird of a guy. I am fairly attractive, nothing too great but I have a good physic, thanks to 5 years of rugby, so people haven't really understood why I like to seclude myself so much. By most people's standards, I look like the type that would be easy going and out with people all the time. But so I failed and lost all my scholarships, I've always been an A and B student so you would think this would hit me really hard but it didn't. I, again, didn't care. Sure I still think about the girl from denmark now, I know she has a boyfriend that she has dated for a year and is happy, and I honestly am glad she is. I don't care about it anymore. The only thing that upsets me about her anymore is the fact that she is doing so well, dating a guy who has an established career, she is studying at the University of Copenhagen, one of the top schools in Europe, and living very happily with him in the city while I am here sitting on my computer, at a shitty delivery job, living in my parents house, a college drop out, and absolutely no friends besides one Spanish girl who I kept in contact with after university. I just feel unbelievably alone but it's by my own doing. I work at some shitty entry level job with the hope of making enough to make one last trip to europe and then... I figure I'll probably kill myself. I'm at $800 now, I need to save around $8000, as my trip goes from Berlin to Barcelona. I don't know why I am posting this. I guess because I have bottled this up so much for so long. I have no history of mental illness in my family so, it would be very unexpected for me to come out to someone that I am depressed.

 My boyfriend and I have been together for over 2 years. We are both in our early 20s and generally have an active, healthy sex life. The problem is that I have gotten many urinary tract infections lately, suffered from e. coli twice, and two yeast infections within the last year. 
 I just recently had my worst infection that lasted about 2-3 weeks, took expensive antibiotics and it finally went away. My boyfriend doesn't feel the need to shower every day. He says just washing his penis in the sink with water will suffice, but every time we have ''dirty'' sex, I get another infection. 
 We had a huge fight the day before yesterday because he wanted sex but I asked him to shower. He said it's not his fault if I get another infection, it's my body's fault. So yesterday I caved and had sex with him even though he didn't properly clean himself. 
 Well, today I got another infection. I don't know what to do. He says it's not his fault even though I properly clean myself, shower every day, drink cranberry juice and lots of water.
Is it that unreasonable to ask him to clean himself before sex?","Bf doesn't shower often and I am prone to UTI's. Is it unreasonable to not have sex with him unless he showers?

"I have no idea how to start this off so forgive me for any formatting errors. I have a lot on my chest and hopefully I can get some advice regarding how I can get through this. 
 Background 
So I am 16 and after our streaming year, I transferred into a new class where I barely knew anyone. At most there were a few acquaintances and some familiar faces. On the first day, I hit it off with a few guys and we became close friends. We had this circle of friends of 9 of us and of course a few others who would talk to us etc. So this issue of insensitivity has not really been addressed but some others from my previous classmates. Basically, they felt that I was too proud and uptight since I was more of the innocent, teachers-pet kind of person and was keeping to the book. Also, I ended up being top or second in class by barely studying and was not really satisfied with some of my marks that others would have been elated to have. So I transferred into the ""higher achievers"" track and that was how I ended up in this new class post streaming. 
 The issue 
So recently, after a school trip I felt that my friends were a lot more distant. We were really close up till the school trip but afterwards everything seemed to fell apart. So one of my closer friends, Alex came up to me one day as I bumped into him and said this, 
 ""Okay, I don't mean to offend you and hopefully you don't take this the wrong way but we feel that you've been really mean. Sometimes you are pretty condescending and it's getting toxic."" 
 So afterwards, we had to split ways as we went home differently and we ended up talking about the issues. So when I fell really ill and this is not a rare occurrence as they know I have been really ill since young, all of them came together to basically discuss about me and Alex outright mentioned that they basically ""talked sh*t behind my back"" and that kinda got to me. So they mentioned how I made fun of others and how I acted condescending and pretended to be a know-it-all. Apart from that they mentioned that I was a nice guy with good intentions. 
 A few key points he mentioned were: 
 
 I tend to take it too far past banter and that I really hurt others. 
 
 I made fun of this guy's marks since he failed miserably despite being really good in the subject. We all know that he is a genius at it but because he did not put in effort, he failed and I really did not understand why he would do that and it got out of hand afterwards. 
 
 
 The reconciliation 
So after this, I started to apologize to a lot of them and mentioned how I more or less was extremely sorry for what I did and they mentioned how they were willing to become close friends again. So apart from Alex, I apologized to Gordon who really was nice to me afterwards. From absolutely no contact to laughs in class, his behavior gave me a lot of hope. However, Alex and his gang who used to hang out with us really seem more distant. When I approach them, they try and avoid me and I have been more conscious about my words. I understand that there is a lot of tension but I want to ease it out and become friends again. 
 Because of my upbringing, I have barely trusted anyone and now that I opened up to them for 2 years, I cannot seem to let go. I really need some outside perspective and if you need more info, feel free to ask in the comments and I want to hear your opinion before I finally settle this with them.","I [16M] feel ostracized from my circle of friends [all 16M] and because they pointed out my flaws, it feels as though everyone has turned against me.

"I was the guy in a similar situation.  She wasn't exactly my supervisor, but we had positions where she was a ""Research Associate Level 4,"" and I was ""Research Associate Level 1,""  she's the one who interviewed and chose me for the job, and she trained me and was who I turned to for guidance on the job.  So I thought of her like a quasi-supervisor, though we had the same boss.  Anyway, she was eight years my senior (still is! - lol), we were working together all the time (our lab benches were across from each other), and we fell hard for each other.  Even when it became obvious there was something there, I think we both were in denial mode for awhile, but eventually, nature took over.  I must say, it was good and bad.  It was good because, well, it's awesome to be around somebody so much when you're falling in love, and we had real chemistry, and we had a lot of fun together.  It was bad because she would sometimes get jealous when I had other female friends in the lab, one of whom had an obvious crush on me (but it put me in a weird position because my gf for awhile didn't want anybody in the lab to know we were dating, so it's not like I could do much about letting this other girl down), and eventually it got kind of tough because it's like, when you're with somebody all day, what do you talk about when you get together in the evening?  It becomes too much.  Now don't me wrong, we made it past all of that and we both eventually got separate jobs.  Plus, I think our situation was made easier because even though she was my supervisor and was many years ahead of me in the field, we both knew I was going back to school anyway, so it wouldn't always be like that.  (That's not to say that a guy can't date somebody who's further along in the same career, but it has been known to introduce complications to the dynamic.) 
 Anyway: working together, you do get to see a lot of a person, so if it's been this long, and you still like him, there's a good chance it's real.  And if you think the feelings are reciprocated, you're probably right.  I won't say the age difference doesn't matter, but it doesn't have to - it kind of depends.  (For one thing, you're supposed to give ages - we were 35 and 27; if you're 27 and 19, that's a little different.)  I'll say it doesn't have to, and there are plenty of couples where the F is older than the male and it's no big deal.  Working together?  Yes, that can be tough, but in this day and age, that's where a lot of people meet.  It depends on the maturity of the individuals involved, but again, totally doable.  So basically, the critical issue is whether or not, as his supervisor, this is doable.  If it's going to be horribly disruptive at work or if it could get one or both of you fired, probably not worth it, especially in this economy, where it can be easier to find love than a job.","I just wanted to let you know that it is doable, as many years later, after many ups and downs (and some time apart), from a similar situation, I'm still with the same girl.",35,M,relationship_advice
"My boyfriend (34M, we'll call him ""Mike"") and I (27F) have been dating solidly for 4 years. This is my longest relationship, and my only sexual partner ever (not a religious choice, just the only relationship where it interested me).  Mike, however, has a messy past.  20+ sex partners, threesomes, sex by the 2nd date, hooking back up with exes, and getting one pregnant and finding out after he left her.  Unfortunately, I did not find out about any of this until recently.  I had asked Mike about kids and marriage and our own future.  He broke my heart by saying kids are too expensive (his baby mama gets a massive chunk of child support) and not worth it (he only visits his kid a few days out of the year, and has no interest in getting partial custody or moving closer to her).  He said marriage is possible but I'm not convinced (he did give me a promise ring).  And then I found out about his re-hookups with his ex through a photo of him kissing his baby mama when his kid was around age 1 (not a great way to learn about that, and especially mad he keeps photos of a woman he loathes.) 
 I struggle to weigh the good (90% of the time) against the bad (10% of really standout problems).  I slowly came to terms with his past, but I hate how he insists the past has NO influence on who he is today.  Ironic, because it's his baby mama situation that makes him cynical towards kids and marriage.  I hate that he lied to me.  I know he was too ashamed to admit ""I tried to leave my ex the whole time I was dating her, I told her I was leaving, she stopped taking birth control without telling me, I finally left her for good, she found out she was pregnant, she cracked the whip, and I came crawling back like a whipped dog to hook up again even though I found her repulsive.""  He says he never loved her, but he went back to her and slept with her again.  He did that with several other exes (no kids with them).  It makes me feel insecure.  Does he love me?  Or is he just keeping me around like he has the other 20 past women?  He says rather emotionlessly, ""You're different this time.  You know I love you.""  Not very romantic or convincing.  We never end a fight where I feel satisfied with his loyalty or love toward me. 
 In general, he is kind and has been a very good boyfriend (adventurous, financially stable, supportive of my career, takes care of me, cuddles and kisses, generally doting and mostly attentive) but he's also often cold.  He shows little emotion.  Money drives his life choices since he pays child support, and he makes decisions without asking my opinion (like deploying to the middle east without telling me about it until the last minute, even though we live together).  If I pose questions like, ""Why did you get back with your baby mama if you hated her so much because she tricked you?"" He will answer with a dismissive and offended, ""That's none of your business.""  This hurts me.  I want to know why he acts the way he does, so that I can protect myself against getting hurt.  I also personally feel (my opinion) that threesomes are cheating on your partner, that going back to your ex because she ordered you to is bad taste and shows no self-respect or discipline, and I'm afraid that in the future he may do something foolish.  He is a ""yes-man"".  If I ask, ""If your ex said you weren't allowed to see your kid unless you sleep with her, would you?"" then he will refuse to answer, or add another ""You ask about foolish things that will never happen.""  If I question his loyalty to me while being away on deployment, instead of saying, ""I love only you and would never betray you,"" he says ""I'll be working the whole time, not socializing.""  Reassuring indeed.  Outside of these incidents, Mike tries very hard to be a good boyfriend.  But it's like dating a Vulcan with a libido.  Cold, logical, forgets his girlfriend has human emotions, focuses on his duty, is quite the pushover and lets his exes control him, sees marriage not as love but as something foolish people jump into, and forgets that I want to hear romantic and reassuring answers that are clear (ex: ""I DO love you and never once considered betraying you because you mean something to me"" vs ""I think you know the answer.""). 
 He is deploying soon.  I would feel terrible breaking up before he leaves since he says he needs me there to get him through the months of awfulness.  But I also don't want to sit around alone at home, our relationship on pause, pondering if he loves me or has loved any girl at all ever.  Maybe there's a reason he hasn't married and is 34? Yes, I admit I sound incredibly insecure.  But Mike's horrible track record of loveless relationships has me very paranoid. Advice is most appreciated. 
 
 **","My boyfriend (34M) of 4 years has an overactive libido and hooked back up with his baby mama (who he never loved) before meeting me.  He says anything from the past is ""none of my business.""  His exes have made him a cynical man towards having kids and marriage.  I feel insecure knowing he dated 20+ women, had wild sex with them, and never loved any of them.

"Tonight my friend and I went on our first date. She is 18 and I am 18. We've known each other for almost a year now and are extremely close. She tells me things like I am the sweetest guy she's ever met, the only guy she feels safe with, stuff like that. I've had feelings for her in the past but she told me she didn't want me to like her. I respected her decision and moved on and those feelings eventually dissipated. 
 Let's fast forward about 5 months, about two weeks ago. We were talking over Skype and overall having fun until she dropped this on me. ""I wish we could go on a date"". I was in shock, completely caught off guard. I didn't what to say. A side of me said ""Hey this is what you've wanted, go for it!"" and another side of me told me I already moved on and should continue to do so. I accepted the date and from that point on, our relationship changed. For the better of course. Constant flirting between us, going out more, late night calls, everything. I thought just maybe this would work out. 
 So now on to the date. I took her out to dinner and then we walked along the beach for a little. It was never a dull moment and we were so into each other. I could feel us connecting and the chemistry. We both just loved every moment and through out the date I constantly kept pushing the barrier with hand holding, arm around her, flirting, just about everything friends wouldn't do. She didn't resist and actually seemed to love it. 
 Now onto the mixed signals. After the dinner and when we were walking along the pier and just talking I had to ask her question. I asked her what made her change her mind? Why all of a sudden did she want to go on a date with me? She didn't give me an entirely upfront response and it was just her smiling telling me ""Oh I don't... I just wanted to :)"". We started talking more about our relationship and then she told me didn't want a relationship right now. I asked why and she told me it was school. I didn't want to make a big scene out of it but I told her, ""...well look at the past 2 weeks, we've given each other a ton of space and it's been working out"". She agreed and gave it some thought for a bit and then we changed subjects and took some pictures. 
 Overall a great night, would not have changed a thing. However, we didn't kiss because I never really saw an opportunity but that didn't bother me. We gave a big hug good bye and she told me it was the best date she's ever been on. Told her I'd call her tomorrow so I'll probably use that time to arrange a second date. Now for the question.  We both an amazing time on our date, lots of touching and flirting but where do I stand with her?  She gave me the whole ""No relationship due to school excuse"" and I honestly thought bullshit in my head when she told me.  Am I missing something? Do I need to go farther to get her to be open to a relationship with me?   Is she playing with my emotions again like she did before and planing on turning me down again?""","Went on date with one of my closest friends, we both had an amazing time together - holding hands, really flirty however she told me didn't want a relationship due to school. Didn't know what to think of it. I mean she is the one who wanted to go on this date. Confused on where I stand with her and if she's playing with my emotions like she did before.",18,M,relationships

I have acquired just under 11k followers and have a good time and have met a lot of good friends. Unfortunately my time with Twitch has come to an end now that I have found hitbox.

"Posting as a throwaway for obvious reasons.
Me (17/m) and my SO (17/f), both in our last year at High school, have been dating for about a year and a half, with a 2 month break somewhere in between. She has always been the slightly jealous type, but it never has gotten this bad. 
 Here's some backstory: 
 A few weeks ago, at our high school athletics day (which is a very casual event around these parts), we were just walking around watching the events, when she decided (in what I assumed was a joking matter) to point out that this guy throwing javelin was really hot. So I, having the joking persona that I do, responded with saying a girl sitting down was hot. Shortly following this, she stormed off, and wouldn't speak to me for two days. Two days. For saying someone was hot. In response to her saying a guy was. 
 Now, we have access to each other's facebook accounts, and that night she talked to her friends about it how me saying another girl was hot was ""betraying our trust"" and ""borderline cheating"", etc. But to her defense, she also said that she only called another man hot to ""test my reaction"". I don't know, but I don't think its very respectful. Can I get a female's opinion on this? 
 Now, recently, she never shows me affection, like barely says the sweet things she used to say, and never touches or cuddles or kisses me unless I ask, and I'm starting to feel ignored. Every time we see each other, the first thing she does is check my phone to see if i'm contacting other girls, and if she does see a text from a girl, she flips out, ignores me for another few days and goes on about how i'm not faithful. Keep in mind that these are simple hello's or questions about classes. 
 Today, it really got bad. Usually, I get to school before her, and me and a group of friends would congregate, with my GF arriving a bit later, and joining us. Today, she didn't come, but was at school. I asked why, and she said ""because she was there."", with 'she' being the girl i said was hot all those weeks ago. She then said ""you should've left"". And went into another one of those bad moods for a big part of the day.

"I have to give this story because something kind of significant actually happened. 
 So I am at school (I'm a 16 y/o male) and I have to poop pretty badly. I go to high school that is pretty gross in most areas and I refuse to take a dump in the bathrooms. Especially me being a nerdy white kid, the majority of my school preys on kids like me. The day goes by agonizingly slow. I check the clock pretty much every minute to see until how long I can do my business. I finally get on the bus and I'm walking to my house almost at a jog. I open my garage door and go to open the door inside the garage that goes into my house and it's locked. I was thinking of what I had to have done to deserve this. I look around and try to find a spare key and I couldn't find one. I decide to run over to my neighbors house. I ring the door and my neighbor (30's white female) answers the door and I say the words ""Hey I just got locked out of my house and I have to use the bathroom really bad can I use yours?"" She looks at me kind of funny and says to use the one downstairs. 
 I go and it feels great and then they offer to let me hang out there since I can't get in my house. (My neighbors and I aren't strangers were actually good friends but we don't usually talk very often). After staying there for about an hour I get a phone call from my brother and asks where I am. I told him where I was and then he tells me to come home. Turns out he was actually home when I got home, he was just sleeping. I didn't think he was home because my family usually has two trucks parked outside in the driveway. One of them was missing so I thought it was my brother just at work.

"Hello Reddit, 
 I have several questions, requesting advice from people that are further ahead in life than me. I am not sure how I am going to write this and I will probably rewrite it along the way. 
 I am a 19 year old male in a Western European country. I am studying law and just passed my first year with honors. The first 4 years of highschool were really tough for me, I have been abused at home, bullied at school (I was the nerdy kid with glasses), put in foster care, kicked out of my house, bullied online (I was an avid gamer and my account got wiped several times after kids beat me up for my password) etc. 
 When I turned 16 I started going to the gym and reading self improvement books. I read a lot online and the computer has always been a big part of my life. I never was the popular guy but I got myself a group of friends in school and a girlfriend. I am currently living with my (ill) mother and sister. 
 When university started I figured I could start with a clean slate. Make a lot of friends and change my life completely. I do not have a girlfriend at this point. During the year I had a lot of contact with peers, guys and girls, but now that summer started within 2 weeks of university being over my social contact dropped. 
 I hung out with friends from highschool for every evening in the past 2 weeks. I became close with a few, but not close enough to hang out with just the 2 of us. Everyone around me has other groups of friends so everyone has other things to do during some evenings (like this one), and I am alone in my house, texting people if they want to hang out. I always try to be nice over text and to receive a ""nah"" or even just having my message read without reply stings. 
 I had a good group of friends in university but not the type of people I can hang out with (heavy drinkers, not my type of crowd). I spent the past 2 days reading books on the beach/woods because my friends would only be able to hang out during the night. The girls I was talking with daily during university all stopped talking to me, two of them blatantly ignoring my messages while having them read (nothing changed in my attitude since the year has been over, as far as I can tell). 
 I don't know what I should do to stop feeling lonely, since that's what hit me tonight, I genuinely feel lonely. I want to make more friends or at least hang out more often with my friends but if I push it I'm going to become annoying because I'm asking the same group of friends (+-20 people) to hang out every evening. 
 I work out 4 times a week and never bring it up, most people I know, including me, dislike people that talk about their working out. People ask me because you can see that I'm built, which flows a conversation. I did well in my year and people seem to like me as I had plenty of friends during the university year. I read books, ranging from novels to self improvement to history and I almost always share things with people if we hang out at a house party (drinks, food etc). I work a job of which I give a % to my mother since she cannot work and I've had several (good) relationships. All in all I'd say I've really tried to improve my life from sitting inside gaming all day, yet I'm lonely and people don't want to hang out with me. I'm not ugly, mean or rude, always more of a listener than a talker, but I know how to keep a conversation going, there never are awkward silences.","19/M, improved my life after having a rough childhood, doing everything to become an interesting person, yet I cannot make any new friends/gilrfriends and I'm very lonely. 
 Added after writing: ""Go to a party"" is sound advice, however I go to festivals every so often with a few friends, I never create a bond with people there that they keep up.

 This whole thing of ""getting married being one of the most important step in your life"" is very overdone, and as a result can be a huge ""doubts generator"". Why? Because all this stuff is unknown to you, except the fact that it's very important and will change your life! (Or so it seems). This is especially true when getting married at a young age, as you don't have many married friends you can share experience with (they'll rather joke on how foolish you are). 
 I'm 25. I've been with my wife for 5 years now, and got married two years ago. At the time, I was obviously in a similar situation as yours and these are two things that helped: 
 
 Don't over-think. Seriously, this might seem stupid but all I can do is point you to these TED talks (I watched them at the time):  1  just makes the grass greener on the other side. Needless to say this is bound to happen when you're given one year (most couples are getting engaged one year before the wedding) to think about one of ""the most important decision in your life"". No later than a month ago, I was sorry to learn that the SO of a good friend of mine decided to leave him because she couldn't handle the pressure of being engaged. Why did I find this sad? Because if they hadn't been engaged since last summer, they would still be together! As I saw it, it wasn't a love issue, but a lot of over-thinking. I sometimes wonder whether they would have actually spent their life together, were there no such thing as marriage in our society. 
 This can be seen as controversial, but ""minimize"" the fact that you are getting married : Getting married is LESS IMPORTANT than living with your SO during several years, getting married is LESS IMPORTANT than having kids with your SO, etc.  I our case, we would be living together after the wedding (which I definitely was ready for), but knew for sure that kids would be for (much) later. I therefore pretty much associated the fact of ""getting married"" as ""we'll be living in the same apartment"" and NOT ""we'll be together our entire life, have kids, a dog, a house, stay in the same city,..."". Of course, I wish we'll be happy our whole life and all, but I think it's bad to think that all this lifelong happiness only depends on who you choose to marry. First, this puts way too much pressure on you when you're getting married. Second, I think it's more sane to take life step by step. There will be another round of thinking (no over-thinking though :P) before the next step (kids? whatever?), and another round before the one after, etc. This also reminds you that there's always work to do to reach the ""next step"". And I believe it's the work you put to reach these next steps that makes you, in fact, happy. 
 
 Looking back, I always think very much the same about the situation, and am happy with my decision. I don't feel trapped like some told me I would, and my relation with my SO didn't suffer like others told me it would. We're living our life like before, except now we're wearing rings. We still party, still go sometimes on vacation each on our sides, kept the same friends as before, etc. 
 Finally, getting married at a young age forced me to think about quite some aspects in life, and I learnt a lot about myself. And of course, it made for some amazing parties and memories.","Forget the ""this is the decision of your life"" BS, take life as it comes.

"I’ve wanted a dog my whole life, my parents weren’t super big on pets, particularly my mom so I never had the opportunity growing up to get one. Well now I’m an adult that provides for herself and lives on my own so I can finally get a dog. The problem is no matter how much research or observations I do, I get really stressed out and anxious about owning a dog. I feel like some of these reasons are perfectly valid and reasonable but honestly, some aren’t and are manifestations of self doubt. Some examples include is there enough space, do I have enough time, and am I patient enough?
I question myself so much on if I’m able to properly own a dog that in my mind this has become a bigger deal to me than the idea of having kids eventually. 
 I guess the biggest thing I’m wondering is, am I cut out to be a dog owner? 
 My current living situation is as follows: I live in a one bedroom apartment with my boyfriend (who LOVES dogs) and two friendly cats (they love children and are fine with the small dogs that have visited). This apartment is on the ground floor and does not have a private patio, there is a communal yard thing that people take their dogs out to so they can go potty and there are numerous dog friendly parks I can walk/drive to as well. I work part time (M,W,F 8-4) and go to school as well so I’m generally not home for about 4 hour chunks of time. I will be graduating in ~3 years so my schedule will HOPEFULLY become more regular after getting a full-time job. My boyfriend’s schedule is sorta opposite of mine and he is a full time student, so no work schedule to work around. Realistically I wouldn’t be able to own my own place for at least 10 years so I’ll be in the renting game for awhile. I’m 23 now and would honestly love to own a dog before then haha. 
 The biggest concerns I have with dogs is noise, friendliness, and activity levels. I like quiet, not incessant barking or howling; barking when someone comes to the door or when they’re playing is fine but other than that I’m not a fan of yappy, annoying dogs. 
 As far as friendliness I do plan on becoming a parent in that dog’s lifetime so I’d like it to be ok with babies/kids as well as cats. I get that socialization when young is key but I know that some breeds are just naturally more friendly than others. 
 I’m not gonna lie, I’m a PRETTY lazy person but I’m open to taking walks, going on hikes, and playing with a dog. I’m just not a runner/jogger type though. 
 If there were such a thing as a dog that was essentially a cat in attitude that would seriously be the coolest thing. I don’t mind chewed clothes or furniture but I don’t like having something going potty all over a house I don’t own, so ease of potty training would be nice. Also grooming needs don’t really matter. I have two long haired cats and I’m skilled with a electric dog shaver. ;) 
 Does this information scream “never own a dog because you are a cat person” or is there a dog out there that will work for me? 
 Thanks for any and all information!",I have always wanted a dog but have a lot of self doubt/excuses I come up with about owning one. Is this realistic for me to do?,23,F,dogs
"I know this is an old post (I've been digging around a lot out of boredom). I just thought I'd weigh in for you OP. 
 I've had five previous relationships that left a significant impact on my thus far short life (I'm 26) and I can break it down like this: 
 1st GF: 8th grade, Freshman/Sophomore years 
 
 Background: Kiddie stuff, asked a girl out she said yes, parents shuttled us around on ""dates"". 
 
 Things I like(d) about her: We had youthful naivety. There was nothing cynical about our relationship, and nothing sexual about it. I remember her as uncomplicated and genuine. 
 
 Where we are now: She's in touch via social media, but we don't really have anything in common short of hometown. Part of why the relationship ended anyway. 
 
 
 2nd GF: Junior Year 
 
 Background: Met her at a concert. We shared musical interests, but she lived out of range of my transportation. So we did the long distance thing. 
 
 Things I like(d) about her: She was spontaneous, and owned her sexuality; she was my first sexual partner, though I suppose passion may have been increased due to physical separation we experienced, so the times we got together we took advantage of. She was always fiercely independent - fought with her parents a lot, which rebellious me, liked at the time. 
 
 Where we are now: Her parents divorced, and her mom got custody; last I'd heard they all took the step-dad's name and moved several states away; I've lost touch with her and miss her out of nostalgia, but am content to keep her as but a memory. 
 
 
 GF3: My first college girlfriend. Sophomore year 
 
 Background: She stood out in our group of nerds at the college. She was a sexy punk chick with hair that changed colors as frequently as Romney's campaign promises. She had played the field quite a bit, many of my friends had dated her, and when my turn came up I was happy to be by her side. She liked to party a bit too much, and that drove a rift between us. We concluded the relationship had no future, and ended it, but were adamant about maintaining our friendship. 
 
 Things I like(d) about her: She was and still is a free spirit. She's very creative, and expresses herself as a painter. Her works always bordered on the surreal/grotesque, and were provocative and intriguing. 
 
 Where we are now: To this day she is one of my fondest friends; she's an art teacher at a school for troubled youths and part time model. 
 
 
 GF4: Second college girlfriend; Remainder of sophomore year + 3 years 
 
 Background: She was the cutest person I've ever met. She had a rehearsed innocence to her that wasn't diminished in the slightest despite being a conscious aesthetic. She was a bubblegoth interested in fashion and Asian culture who ran in the same friend group as GF3 and myself. When GF3 had asked me out, I had been preoccupied with pining over GF4 who at the time was in a relationship with a friend. Once things went south with GF3, I took some time to reorient myself, and asked GF4 out. That marked some of my happiest days. She was everything to me. We shared joy and grief, our families came to know each other; at the time, I thought she could have been the one. But I messed up. I didn't apply myself enough or focus hard, and I lost my scholarship and couldn't afford school anymore. This set us in two different directions, me playing catch up and damage control, and her on the path to personal achievement and success. Her interest in fashion consumed thousands of dollars which she was happy to work long hours at multiple jobs all while studying and passing classes like a champ. Eventually she came to the conclusion that maintaining our relationship was not beneficial to her future educational plans, and after a heartbreaking series of discussions and personal realizations that would plant some seeds of self loathing, we called it off. It was better for her this way, and I never wanted to be anything to hinder her. 
 
 Things I like(d) about her: She had a very cute aesthetic to her, but more importantly she was SMART, probably one of the smartest people I know, honestly. I deeply admire her drive and dedication and her work ethic is unparalleled. I especially admire her focus as it pertained to her studies in the fields of academia. 
 
 Where we are now: We're still very close. She completed her masters, and now is a professional librarian modernizing the system at some law library in CA. She came to be friends with my current (who is also my fiancee) and we are all so cordial with each other that she will likely be in our wedding party. 
 
 
 GF5 was a mistake. Super senior year. 
 
 Background: I held it together for about a week after GF4 left, but then I collapsed; I rebounded with a girl significantly younger than me (18 and 23) for the first time in my life - mostly out of loneliness, partially out of a desire to feel attractive. She was an actress in local stage productions and we met in a theater class. As it turns out all the things I thought we had in common were fabricated; she researched me and acted the part, she wasn't particularly mature at the time, (but I blame myself for succumbing to my vulnerabilities). When it turned out her interests lay in the occult, pseudosciences and astrology especially (she would introduce her self to my friends by demanding they tell her what time they were born so she could determine how to interact with then), I knew I had to end it. She wasn't happy about this, and made a scene on several occasions on campus in front of others, basically yelling accusations about things I had done to her that could be potentially ruinous if anyone took them seriously. After the second occurrence, I threatened her with a restraining order, and we didn't have contact for three years after. 
 
 Things I like(d) about her: Not much, I tell you. However she was conventionally beautiful, still is, and for all her flaws, she was and is a talented thespian. And I did admire her passion for theater. 
 
 Where we are now: Though mutual friends and social media, things have returned to normal between us. I hear from her now and then; she does indie films in Manhattan. I am genuinely happy that her efforts have landed her her dream job.

"So I have an amazing girlfriend. I've known her since we were both 12 years old as we both went to school together. She's an incredible 5'8 beauty, with a kind heart, and she is a loving person with a silly and outrageous sense humor, she is furthermore a great and trustworthy friend. 
Ok, so now onto my dreaded self. I am an average looking 5'7 guy with a weird sense of humor, in an alright retail job, with limited social skills particularly amongst other guys, and I also have bisexual tendencies. My brother once described me as 'feeble'. I feel so. 
Anyway. I went through my school years being bullied and getting called 'gay' by most guys at school and the girl was always there for me. Our relationship then was solely one of friendship then, but we were truly close even then. I told her about my bisexual tendencies, and it was really difficult then because I felt so confused whether or not I was completely gay, or if this was a phase. regardless, she was there for me. I always thought she was too good for me, even as a friend, and whilst I knew I'd be jealous if she was in a relationship with another guy at the same level as her, it'd be better for her because she'd be with someone she actually deserves. 
So we finished school and I travel a fair distance away to study law at university. Funnily enough our relationship as friends in that time became stronger because we both matured as people. We had more to share and talk about; every time I came home is make time to see her. Even if I was coming down for two days, it was as important seeing her as it was my family. All through Uni I was single (I had a fling or two with a girl once and a guy at another time.. But they didn't go anywhere), whereas she dated a few guys but never got into a proper relationship. There was one guy that she was with for a good few months. In fact this guy.. This guy.. Basically they met at one of my brothers wedding when she was with me as MY date! But we were still just friends then, and I still felt she was too good for me. So they were dating for a good few months and I remember feeling, instead of jealous, a strong desire that she was being taken care and she was happy. When they broke up I knew I couldn't just 'keep hoping' she'd be happy but be there to make sure instead. So I kissed her. We were sitting watching a film together alone, and viola, she knew my feelings for her. In spite of my feebleness, my average looking appearance, my lack of confidence in myself and everything about me that is weird and dislikable (mostly in my experience from other guys) she was happy to be in a relationship with me. It has been pretty much half a year and we are doing great, and I know I'm incredibly lucky to have her. 
 I've always been saying from the beginning 'oh she's out of my league', and whilst I know this to be true, being reminded of this by other people has been getting to me. I've said it to her and she generally rolls her eyes. I heard my workmates all exclaiming that I'm 'really punching above my own weight', and even in the middle of the street in the town I work (Glasgow, so don't be surprised) folk have shouted 'you're way too good for him!'... It's flattering for her I'm sure, but fuck do I feel shit about myself. I remember asking my girlfriend 'why aren't you with another guy!?' and she responded gently 'honestly, because they're not you.. You get me'.. Which pretty much had me in tears. She's incredibly accepting and doesn't see me the way the world, or myself seems to (maybe I need glasses). Whilst I'm happy being with her (and wow the sex is just..) I continually feel shit about myself when people are so shocked by the fact I've scored someone so amazing. I feel like my girlfriend is duped by our history as school friends and doesn't see how pathetic I really am, unlike the rest of the world. 
 Anyway, 
What do I do to change the way I feel or to change the way other people perceive me? I want to get super fit and improve on my confidence, and my relationships with other guys as friends, but am I doing this for the wrong reasons? What should I do? Thanks everyone.","I'm a 6 and my girlfriends a 9, and I feel shit about myself as a result. How do I not feel this way?",23,M,relationships
"When I was 14 my stepdad drunkenly confessed his lust for me and trapped me in a multi-hour conversation in the middle of the night in my bedroom about how connected he felt to me and how my mother wouldn't understand. I told my dad/stepmom the next day and the police paid my stepdad a visit. He didn't touch me so he couldn't be charged with anything but was warned. I didn't see him for a year (I already lived with my dad) and my mom stayed with him. Therapy all around. 
 I eventually did forgive him for the incident. I've never had any indication he's done anything else like that and he's always been extremely remorseful. I actually have a much harder time forgiving my mom, because I can't imagine staying with someone who did that to my daughter. Even so, it was decades ago now and we have mostly put it behind us. 
 However, I now have two small kids (8 and 3) and my mother has mentioned a few times she can't wait until they're old enough and they can come visit my mom and stepdad for a week like I used to do with my grandparents. My mom is fantastic with kids and I have no doubts about leaving them alone with her. My stepdad... has never raised kids (I was 11 when they married and he was 24), has shown terrible judgment in the past and has a few questionable habits now (lots of pot smoking) which make my husband and I not want this type of visit to occur. In fact, I don't want him being alone with our kids, nor does my husband. I don't exactly feel like the same situation would reoccur, I just mistrust his judgment and awareness of boundaries, which obviously stems from my past experience with him. 
 So the kids are too young for this visit to be an issue at the moment, but I feel like I'm anxiously sitting on this conversation I need to have with my mom. Any suggestions on how to approach it?

"Me and some friends where out camping/biking in the middle of the woods. As a bigger guy, (trust me when i say big) I would coast down the hill from camp just on inertia alone. Do to the extreme speeds, (20 or so miles I would assume. I am a really big guy.) I always went first. However, about 3 days into our week long trip, I went down the hill in about the middle of the pack. Somehow I lost control of the bike and and then proceeded to roll down the hill tumbling with my bike. After a bit, the bike ejected me and flung me forward in to a small boulder about the 2x the size of your average computer monitor. I uprooted the rock (it was about 3 inches in the ground) and then set in on course down the hill. I hit it with my right shoulder/head and ended up snapping my collar bone in half. My helmet was shattered into 7 pieces but i only had a small concussion and a large goose-egg. But the part you really want to hear about is my left arm.

"My boyfriend [27/m] constantly brings up that I [25/f] have too much stuff and I should get rid of my books sometime. I have two big bookcases and a third small one. 
 We're thinking about moving to a new apartment soon and I told him I saw a nice two bedroom apartment that isn't too much more than what we're paying now for a one bedroom and it includes heating (currently we pay for heating). Also, no carpet in the bedroom which is a win for me and it includes a garage. The extra bedroom I can use for guests or a study room. 
 When I told him if he wanted to see the apartment (I didn't say we have to take it right now or anything). He's like ""I'm not paying more for your shit!"". 
 That made me feel so crappy. It's not about the paying more part but the fact that he just cursed me out and my stuff :( But actually, he did say he had a max limit for new apartment and it was like $200 below what the max price he would pay. 
 I know possessions are stupid and materialistic. But I love my books and maybe I'll get rid of some of them but I want to keep most of them.

"I had a paintball field in my backyard as a kid with camo canvases for blinds and one day I went out and all my blinds are missing.  I had mentioned this to a neighbor who said they heard that a couple 4 wheelers had been stolen in the neighborhood as well.  So being the 17 yr old I am with a garage full of dirtbikes an quads thinking that could have been me, a friend and I decided to go looking for the stolen quads that I assumed were under my missing camo canvases. 
 Now I know every trail in the area like so im very confided we can find this if its within walking distance.  So we take a hike out and maybe a 1000 feet down the first trail I see some fresh quad tracks heading into the bushes, and as were standing on the trail still my buddy says hey is that camo under that tree back there.  And 200 ft into the bushes/trees you can see the camo canvases under this hemlock tree!  We run over to find my missing blinds and the stolen quads under the tree! 
 But there was a bonus! A camo jacket used to ""cover"" the stolen quads.  And on the jacket is the spot for your name and where your name would be printed the kid had written his own last name on the jacket in marker!  BAM Busted!  So we call the cops have em come get the quads back so my neighbors can have nice stuff again!  Well not really the quads where beat!  Come to find out the kids who stole them lived just around the corner from us!  And after all this was said and done the parents bought both of them brand new quads!  So we tell the cops not to use our names for anything but they take them anyway. 
 So flash forward a few months and we find out there is some kind or reward money that I will be getting I think $300 was the amount.  So im pumped I get my reward check cash it and spend that $ Well like a week or two later we get a letter in the mail or a phone call im not really sure as my parents handled all of this and never told me.  And they said there was a mistake and I was only supposed to get half the money! WTF 
 I think it was like 3 months later I get a summons in the mail to go to a juvenile court and apparently testify or make a statement about what had happened.  My worst nightmare I NEVER would have stayed to show them where the quads where if I knew this was going to happen, just an anonymous tip!

"So, this happened about a year ago, and it still brings tears of both regret and joy to my eyes. So I'm a young lad of about thirteen at the time, my birthday is coming up and I decide to test my hand at mantis keeping. One Internet order later and my D. lobata is inbound. The day of the incident was beautiful I decide to take my bearded dragon outside for some grazing. A action that will now always make me think twice. I allow my buddy to walk around and just enjoy life. We don't use pesticides or fertilizers so he can eat as much grass or clover as he pleases. Suddenly, my mom calls my name. My package has arrived, and I look in her direction just as my little Rex decides to go full on adventure mode and speeds of into the woods near my house. It takes a while to register as tears come to my eyes. I spend the next couple days posting signs and handing out fliers broken heartedly with a friend, as well as non-stop searching. Sadly the family planed a vacation to cape cod for a couple days in honor of my birthday. The day of the trip had some very strong feels and I didn't want to go, but alas, the obligations family brings. We get to the cross sound ferry and board, a nice day in retrospect. The ferry pulls out and we get a call, the man speaks of seeing my little guy on the side of the road, unscathed. The dovahkiin must have become over encumbered and stopped for a nap on the side of the road. This fueled the fire that was my hope to find him. However, the ferry had left  and there was no way back. My parents, much to my dismay, did not wish to go on a round trip and we just kept going along, I cried a little almost every night, but no ragrets, not a single letter. We headed back on my birthday and met my cousin for lunch. As we explored the surrounding area, my father got a call, he had been found the day we had left and was currently in greenport, picked up by a landscaper who later discovered the missing signs. We picked him up on the way back and he had all his limbs and as we later found, no parasites.

"18 years old, male, 6'1 @ 255lbs 
 Me about 3 weeks ago: [Imgur]( 
 So I'm starting the Couch to 5k program with my mother, the other day was our first day. First of all, it should be known that I've been losing weight since late April, and I'm down from 316lbs. I'm constantly asked what my goal is, and my family all thinks it's insane. 200lbs~ is my ballpark goal, they all tell me it's too low, and I'll be too skinny. 
 Well I've been running a mile every other day for awhile now, but want to actually train for a 5k, and my mother wants to as well, so why not, I'll start off on Day 1 with her and progress along with her. While we were in a running section, she was having a hard time. I told her to just go at her own pace and I'll match her, and not to try and match me. (being 6'1 means I can cover a lot more distance than her, plus I'm more used to running (But not good at it)) Any way, she ended up talking during a walking section about how it's hard for her because she's 80lbs overweight, and I'm not. I told her ""No, I'm about 50lbs overweight, I'm fat too."", she looked at me funny and said ""No you're not, you're not fat."" At this point I lifted my hoodie and showed my glorious belly, with a ""Told ya so"" face. Her words ""You just need to tighten that up, I bet most of that is just skin anyway."" 
 Wat. 
 Now I'd like to ask something of the r/fitness community, and it's perfectly fine if you feel creeped out and don't want to do this. If you're similar in body frame, and at your healthy weight, could you submit a picture? If you have a Fat to Fit story post it in the comments, especially before/after pictures. I'd love to show them to my family. Blurr out your face, edit out your face, draw a smiley face on you, do whatever, but I'd like to be able to show my family what a healthy weight for my height is, and I think it would help to be able to show them this and have them realize that people actually weigh that ""light"". 
 On a side note, my family is all losing weight (save for one, another story). My mother has lost 15 or so, father has lost 30, brother has lost nearly 50, and I've lost 60. I love the fact that we're getting healthier, but I'm afraid they don't know what healthy is. My father stated he wants to get to 250. That's his goal.. I'm afraid they're going to get to their ""goals"" and not see the results they want, then give up. We've tried so many times before, albeit without success because we gave up so soon, but I don't want to see them give up again.","Started C25K w/ mom, she said I'm not fat, even though I'm fat.

It was them that got my ass moving and motivated to loose weight, and I still go to them for motivation when I'm feeling down. Without them, I wouldn't have started losing weight, and my family wouldn't have ether. So, if for some reason you're reading this, JKFilms, thanks! You helped change my life already!",18,M,Fitness
"Im about to buy a powercage, olympic bar and weights for the garage. Im also getting a suspension band for bodyweight exercises. 
 I'm stuck with figuring out what my best routines should be. The idea behind getting the cage etc is to continue 5x5 at home. The idea behind the suspension band is to do other supplimental bodyweight exercises. 
 Im currently on a CKD diet or very low carbs, high fat, with a re-feed day once a week but Im not too sure its a good diet to fuel this lind of workout. I've lost around 3-4stone on this diet but ive plateaued big style over the last 6 months. 
 I have a lot of weight still to lose. I'm currently 18.5 stone and 6ft 3inches tall. My MAIN AIM is to lose weight, add muscle and get fitter for the sake of me and my kids.

"We started dating in the summer, when we were both only working part-time jobs. From the start, I was clear that once school rolled around I wouldn't be able to see him very often because I'd be taking 8 courses at college (for engineering), and that my first priority would be school. On top of that, we both have our own jobs and we don't live very close. It's a 25-minute drive on a good day, and up to 80 minutes if there's heavy traffic. I have school from Monday to Friday from 8:30am to 5:20pm or 6:20pm, depending on the day, so from Monday to Friday we only talk on the phone for about an hour. On weekends I set time aside to see him for about 3-7 hours, depending on my work load. 
 Despite this, he is always trying to get me to see him more. I understand why - he is crazy about me - but while I would love to just hang out with him, I can't. I just have too much work to do. So I keep turning him down, feeling immensely guilty each time because I feel like such a shitty girlfriend. Even the 1-hour phone calls each night I feel are a bit much. I don't resent them, they just mean I'll have to stay up longer each night to do homework/studying. 
 He is very much in love with me and while I love him, I consider our relationship much more casually than he does. He says that he misses me all the time, while I...don't. I mean, we see each other each week and while I enjoy spending time with him, I just don't miss him as much as he misses me. He tells me that I'm the best thing to happen to him, and I believe it because of the other things that have happened in his life (he's an Afghanistan veteran). I don't know if we have a future together because I'm so young, and I feel like he's pressuring me into a long-term commitment because of his age. Believe me, I've told him that I don't know what I want from life because of my age, and I've told him that I feel uncomfortable when he tells me that I'm the best thing to happen to him because it creates pressure on me. 
 Am I being unfair? Should I be setting more time aside for him? Is it fair for me to date him even though I don't know if we have a future together (getting married, kids, etc)?","on top of school and work, my boyfriend [32M] and I [21F] don't see each other that often.

"Hey all. I'm really really confused about my feelings now and could use your input more than anything. Sorry that this is a long one. 
 Just to start with some background, my ex-gf (F, 22) broke up with me (M, 22) near the end of August. We were on a month-long break at first, but eventually she just got distant and ended the relationship when we got back for fall semester. Her reasoning was she ""just wanted to be single"" and ""didn't have feelings anymore."" It caught me off guard because, at first, she was more open to making things work out. I was in the middle of applying to medical schools, worried about finding an internship for my grad program, plus had some rough personal (depression, anxiety, low self-esteem) and family stuff going on, and this absolutely devastated me. Needless to say I felt very betrayed, especially since I was a big support system for her over the summer when she was battling a weird existential crisis while she was at home and I was up at university (I was studying for the MCAT, doing grad courses, and other commitments). She wanted to stay friends and I agreed to it because I still cared a lot about her...bad call on that. The sadness and stress just bottled up inside me so much that I ended up attempting suicide that night when I was very drunk. When I realized what I was doing, I stopped myself and cried harder than I ever thought I could. My roommates found me, calmed me down, and Baker Acted me. 
 Thankfully since the breakup, my parents, several of my closest friends, and my therapist have been a solid support system for me throughout the recovery process. They and, unfortunately, my ex knew about my attempt. I've been focused on school, keeping up with healthy activities (diet, exercise, mindful thinking), and took up new hobbies to help me move on from what happened. I also kept NC with my ex because I really needed space after what happened. Unfortunately, we still had a couple of conflicts, one of which I posted on a separate account here 
 Even despite all that I went through, despite her being self-centered and inconsiderate, despite me being happier with life and start to love myself a little bit, I noticed that I started to miss her again as of Sunday. I keep thinking about her and what she's doing now. I keep feeling this urge to forgive her and start talking to her again, even though I know that she's going to probably lead me on and hurt me even more. I don't even regret what happened to us and don't want the relationship to rekindle; heck, I don't want anything to do with her. I just don't know how to handle this and need advice. Why am I getting these thoughts and feelings?",Been recovering from breakup and suicide attempt. Improving despite conflicts with ex. Starting to miss her again.

"I commented in another thread a few days ago regarding this predicament, and I'm still flummoxed enough to make it its own post. 
 I'm 34f. I have a great job, take care of myself, I look pretty damn good. I'm also blunt and more aggressive than most chicks I know. He is 23m in the Midwest. We met about a year ago when I was out at our satellite office where he was interning. I thought he was hot, but I was in a long term relationship so I didn't think anything beyond ""he's hot; I'd hit that."" (it is normal for me wonder for a brief moment what it's like to fuck guys with whom I interact - a step beyond ""I wonder what they look like naked."") We'd exchanged numbers and texted sporadically and kept it strictly platonic. He got a job at another company a couple months later, and we lost touch. 
 Fast-forward to a month ago. He heard I was single and due out there soon for business. He texted me and it became rather hot pretty quickly. I was the aggressor. My business trip fell through, so I decided to say fuck it and told him straight up that I wanted to fuck and suck him dry, and suggested I go out for a weekend. He agreed and we chose a weekend and since I'd only been there on business, he suggested a bunch of cool places to see/things to do. (Note: for me, the long distance and the age difference would be no-gos had I been looking for a relationship; just sex it's OK) 
 We had a weekend-long hotel fuckfest that broke personal records - it was unreal. We also had fun. He showed me his apartment, introduced me to his friends, and all went out together both nights. We also had great dinners and laughed a lot. I stupidly assumed that because the sex was fanfuckingtastic and we got along really well, hooking up whenever I'd be in town - even the occasional weekend - would be a win-win. 
 We resumed texting - he asked if I got home ok. The day after I got back I said I had an awesome time and asked if he would like to have a repeat of the weekend, and because I like to plan in advance, suggested some dates over a month out that might work. He was non-committal in responding - ""Yeah but I might have XYZ but lemme check - I'll get back to you.""  We've texted a little less as work has been crazy and I've been out and about, and I responded to his text 3 days ago - mine didn't warrant a response, and he hasn't responded. 
 Part of me thinks I came on too strong and freaked him out when I suggested Round 2 (with specific dates...ugh). I definitely got caught up in the excitement - neither of us had ever done something like that before.  Part of me thinks that since I didn't tell him my expectations nor ask what his were, he may think I want something more.",I proposed sex whenever I'm in town and got crickets in response.

"Three years ago I was dating a girl I was very keen on. We dated for several years, talked about marriage a little bit. She helped my family through my dad's death from cancer. I owe her a lot. College was ending, the relationship was called into question and I was still young enough to have higher hopes than settling down. College ended, I moved states, she needed to make a decision on where to practice law and I wasn't willing to commit. She stayed. I moved. 
 Fast forward to now. My career is 'great.' I'm a software developer. I have a $30K nest egg and no debt. I work as a contractor 10 hrs/week at a charming company. I walk to work, they pay me great, I choose my own hours. What's not to love? The rest of my time is spent working on developing a music player. I love music a lot and the software has been well-received. It has 150K users, has been featured in articles across the web and could easily become a company given enough elbow grease. 
 I've been visiting my mom for the past week back in my home state. When I arrived, I was feeling homesick and decided to write my ex-gf an e-mail. I didn't have any real goals in mind with it. Reducing loneliness, picking up where we left off, something like that. She responded after a few days. The conversation was just as good as I had hoped. She was just like I remember her and we e-mailed back and forth for quite some time. However, in the middle of it all, she mentioned that she was meeting her new boyfriend's parents for the holidays and was nervous about it. She didn't mean any ill will from it all, but it really tore me up more than it should have. 
 I haven't dated anyone in years. I'm still young, but I'm focused on my career and I feel like I need a lot more focus to make it into something appreciable. However, the realization that my ex-gf has moved on and is meeting his parents where as I .. haven't dated and have only had sex a couple of times in the past few years.. was a bit unnerving. 
 I feel like I made the wrong choice, but, also, if I had never made the choice I would always be wondering what it would've been like to pursue a career.

"34/M/240lbs -53lbs from 291+ 
 I've lost a total of 53 lbs since March 2012, following a pretty strict keto diet. I rarely, if ever, cheat, and when I do it's very small portions. I sometimes go an entire day w/o consuming more than 10 carbs. I also do some exercise: biking to work, started a C25K program and barefoot running, burpees, planks, bridges, stuff like that. 
 Here's the issue: for the past four months, I've been unable to get below 240 lbs. Sometimes I'll drop to 238, but then a day or two later the scale is back above 240. I'm not altering my diet. I'm not lifting weights and ""replacing"" fat weight with muscle weight. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. 
 The only thing I can think of is my polycystic kidney disease. My father told me that his doctor told him once that he could never weigh less than 235 because of his swollen kidneys. I have swollen kidneys (in fact, you can even feel them on the front of my torso!) and I wonder if this is what's holding me back. As I said, I'm not changing much else in my lifestyle but I don't think I've reached my loss potential; I still have a lot of fat stored around my middle. 
 Any suggestions? Fellow kidney disease sufferers: have you noticed the same issue?","I think my polycystic kidney disease is keeping me from losing any more weight. 
 EDIT: Thanks to everyone for the help. The consensus seems to point toward portion sizes, which is something I've largely ignored from the beginning.

"Okay , I'm 14(girl) and I have a stutter.  I don’t care if people know about it.  And for people who can talk with no problems, you don’t know how lucky you are.  People (like my mom or other people) are always trying to have me do the talking anywhere because hopefully I’d get better at it.  Does that work?  Has it worked?  Nope.  All that happens is make me stutter worse and makes me just want to die of embarrassment.  There are times when I can talk fine, but it doesn’t happen often.  Also, some people treat me like I have mental problems because I stutter.  :/ 
 Now …I want to pretend I’m mute so I don’t have to talk and therefore stutter.  It wouldn’t be very hard not to talk since I already try not to.  But if people thought I was mute, they wouldn’t force me to talk because I “can’t”.  I’d much rather type or write what I want to say because it’s easier for me. 
 But  there are some things I’m not sure about.  For one I acted like I couldn’t talk and I wrote that down on paper to tell my parents or whoever I’m with, I don’t know what would happen after that.  Would I get rushed to the doctors/hospital and I’d get my vocal cords checked in which there’d be nothing wrong with them?  That’s what I’m the most worried about.  If I can pull it off, (I’d probably tell my closest friends the truth) what if later I accidently talked or laughed and then the secret would be out?  I’m afraid that people might jump to conclusions and think I did all of this for attention.  Which is far from it… 
 If  I do this and get caught, I know two things I could say.  The truth…I did it so I wouldn’t have to talk or I could say I wanted to see how it felt to be mute because of a character in a book I'm writing.  No, I don’t have a mute character in my book…yet.  But I could add one in the next if that’s the case. 
 So , can anyone give me any advice on this?  Is it worth it?  Can you think of anything I should be aware of if I try this?  Do you know anything bad that could happen if I do this? 
 I  want to think over this and not rush in recklessly.  By the way, I can talk perfectly well if no one's around or no one can hear me. DX

"Well, sort of. I was 14 at the time, at Jewish summer camp, so no actual sex occurred, but we messed around for a while (made out and some more, I will get into it later). It starts with one of my female friends talking about how this girl, lets call her Sarah, wants to hook up with me. Sarah's pretty cute, a ginger, but she has this brother, lets call him Robert, who's a huge asshole. Like, the worst of the worst, a self proclaimed ghetto white Jew who got pretty abusive at times too. I prefered to stay away from him, but I thought it would be best if I asked him. Basically, I asked Robert for permission, and he seemed pretty indifferent about it, and with me being a sex crazed horny ass 14 year old, I was all over it. So I did the deed a few times behind a cabin or whatever, and after we hooked up a few times, I fingered her. This was my first time and being the 14 year old that I was, I ran to my cabin and yelled (God, the shame), ""Smell my finger, bitches!"" waving my pussy soaked finger to my friends. So, word got around, and Robert found out and basically the next day, I was going to the outhouse and he and his friends followed him and beat the shit out of me.

"I was in 5th grade when it happened - I still remember so many details about when it happened. Mrs. Alan's, my teacher, face falling when she got the call and how she sat down in front of the whole class and explained that something bad had happened. Kids were asking so many questions but you could tell she was so overwhelmed that she could barely respond. My dad drove over to my school, redneck rambo'd out, and practically dragged me and my brother out of the school. 
 When everything came to the surface, I remember sitting in front of the TV and watching the planes hit the towers over and over while my brother and I ate Happy Meals. I felt sick, but I didn't want to cry because I thought my family would accuse me of being a cry baby (my dad wanted a tough daughter) so I went to my room and watched TVLand, which started playing I Love Lucy episodes with a little news crawl at the bottom. 
 I remember staying home from school for a week and half after the attack, my dad refused to let us go out of the house for a while so I just sat there in the basement watching TVLand under a blanket for hours. I remember laughing at an old Batman episode then feeling extremely guilty for doing so - there were so many people crying all over the nation that I felt my moment of happiness was selfish. My brother was too young to understand the situation completely so he didn't understand why I was like a zombie for the weeks and months following 9/11. He was just happy he got to stay home and play video games. 
 Eventually I went back to school and everyone was all over the place. We had drills almost every other day, like what to do if someone suspicious came on to campus or if there was a tornado - I knew what it really was and I told some of the other kids and my teacher pulled me aside and told me I needed to stop saying stuff like that and I got really mad and told her that it's better to know than to believe a lie. My parents got called and my dad got his head bitten off by my mom for being honest with me, but I'm glad he was, it may have made me anxious but I was aware.","Was in 5th grade, heard the news, got pulled out of class.

"Alright, so I'm a girl, 5'5 and I weigh 94 pounds. Needless to say I am not very alcohol tolerant. A few days ago me and my close group of friends had a sort of party thing with a lot of booze involved. And yes before I know it I've drank way too much and I spent basically the whole night next to the toilet. I think I threw up about 6 ish times and the morning after another 2 times. Woke up with a gigantic hangover that took me a day to get rid of, and I felt so sick I had to call my brother confessing I threw up and asking him to pick me up. Embarrassing af. 
 My friends are pissed that I spent the whole night in the bathroom and they had to take care of me. I feel so ashamed and so guilty. This one friend even gave me a whole speech that I ruined the whole party for her and I should personally apologize to everyone involved (I think thats what she said, I dont really remember exactly). It hurt me so much to hear that, but she's right. 
 And yes, I know that I reaaaally fucked up and I need to drink less given that I'm a lightweight. I know that. I've heard that speech already. This isnt the first time I went a little overboard. It has never been THIS bad though. Like holy shit I already spent the last 3 days crying about it because I feel so guilty and embarrassed. Especially guilty. 
 So lets shift this to my supposed drinking problem. Its not that I get blackout drunk at every party I go to. There are parties where I didnt drink any alcohol because I know from myself that I cant really stop once I've had a drink. Or I just didnt go to the party at all. But there are also parties where I've had a lot (not really incidents with puke, well that happened one time before but it wasnt a lot, basically just occasions where I come off as very tipsy). Most of my friends go out partying like once a month at least. I go out less often, but when I do drink alcohol, I'll admit that I do drink rather much for my weight. 
 So basically I've learned my lesson. I ruined the party, my friends probably hate me right now, I'll probably have to hear jokes about throwing up non stop for the next month or so, and I have encountered the mother of hangovers. I understand that I need to know my limits better. I know that. I've recieved the message. I just dont know how to approach my friends after this incident. Should I maybe text them or something?

"I rent a room in a owner occupied house. I live with the landlord Mike, his g/f Beth, and another renter roommate. I have girlfriend named Katie who stays over about 4 nights a week. We are all in our early 20s. edit: I have only been living here for less than 2 month. I didn't know Mike or Beth before I moved in. 
 A few days ago Mike had a bunch of people over so when Katie and I returned home at around 9PM we had to park on the lawn adjacent to the driveway to avoid parking people in. The next morning Beth backed into Katie's car pulling out to go to work, causing a substantial dent to the driver's side door, at least 8x8 inches and 1 inch deep. The paint is chipped/scratched, and the window offers resistance when rolling up and down. Katie's car is probably worth $1500-2000. I noted tire imprints which suggested that Katie's car had been pushed sideways 3-4 inches by the impact. Katie took the car to a mechanic for an assessment. He quoted her $250 to work the dent out without damaging the paint any more, and making the window 100% operational again. Katie texted Beth to tell her she took it to a mechanic and that the price was $250. 
 I then get a text from Mike asking me to meet to talk about it. I meet up and tell him that this is really between Beth and Katie and I don't to get involved. He blows up at me. Shouting, swearing, basically says its Katie's fault for ""parking on the lawn without permission"" and says he won't shell out $250 for ""a car that isn't worth $1000."" Tells me he can fix it himself and that it was unreasonable to take it to a mechanic without trying to work out a deal. Says that if Katie want's a check ""she can drive her ass over here and get it but she's never coming back in."" Also states that he and Beth will LIE to the insurance company and say that Beth never hit Katie's car if Katie files a claim. Throughout the conversation I am very calm, trying to diffuse the situation, asking him not to yell at me. His demeanor is very aggressive and IMO disrespectful. Eventually I stop trying to discuss it with him and tell him I want to terminate the lease early, he agrees, and I get it in writing. Now it will terminate OCT 31st rather than FEB 28th.

"So, yesterday morning, I drove to THEIR church for this retreat. The first several hours consisted of sitting around in an all-purpose room and doing silly activites and icebreakers. There were only about 15-20 people there (ages 16-50 probably), but try as I did, I could not connect with them. I pretended to be religious, but it seemed as though their religion was all that there was to these people. While I was having my lunch of Cool Ranch Doritos (the only good part of this whole thing!), it dawned on me that I can connect better to atheists because they (we :)) are deeper people. We don't have this crap religion to fill all the voids in our personality, so we make up for it with actual purpose and being interesting. I wiped the Cool Ranch crumbs out of my beard, and, for the first time in 20 years, felt happy at church because of this realization. 
 Right before the end of the retreat, we had one last activity. We passed around a big plastic ball, and whoever was holding it had to talk about what he/she learned at the retreat. People spewed all this bullshit about love and Jesus and strength, and eventually the ball made its way to me. I had tied my Geoxes tight in preparation for this moment. I stood up, gently pushed the ball away, and said, ""I'm sorry, but I can no longer go on like this. I am an atheist -- a proud, intelligent, skeptical atheist. Sitting around here today and hearing all of the nonsense flow from each of your mouths has shown me that I need to start living the life I want to live. I can no longer live this charade. I am an atheist, and as much as you think you love this imaginary sky magician, your children or grandchildren will be atheists once logic reigns supreme and Christianity is wiped out. Thank you and good day, sirs."" 
 Just as I was about to walk away, some big guy grabbed the ball and threw it right at my face. Hours and hours of MUGEN have honed my reflexes pretty well, so I was able to roll to the side and dodge the ball as flew into the kitchen doorway behind me. The woman next to me then reached out and clawed at my neck, but I spun as I was standing up and I think my ponytail whipped into her eyes because she fell back. I heard angry shouts and people coming after me as I ran into the kitchen. I saw the ball sitting on the floor and one of the stove burners still on. Knowing science, I grabbed the ball and put it on top of the burners, and as the angry mob of ""good Christians"" filled the kitchen, the ball popped with a gunshot-like noise long enough to daze them. I was a bit high on adrenaline at the moment, so I pumped my fist in the air and shouted ""Science always wins!"" before I ran out of the kitchen, into the hallway, and out the door to my car. I popped in a Megadeth CD and floored it (left some tiremarks in their parking lot) and here I am now, in a strip mall parking lot on my laptop. 
 I'm afraid of what I will face when I get home. A priest has probably already contacted my family. Everyone else in my family is a devout Christian, I guess you could call them fundies. My mom and sister will be mad, but it's my dad that will be the worst. I don't doubt that he will be violent.

"Hello! 
 Today it was the last day of mine at work. I have graduated from university not much, but 5 months ago. While I was studying, I also was working full-time as a software developer. However my graduation project made me change my career plans. 
 While working, I started to question the job I was working on. It did not satisfy me at all, finance sector namely. Writing yet another program, which probably will have a lot of impact on peoples lives but yet to be ignored. Then I decided to do something else as a graduation project, which was a guitar education game (Rocksmith replica). When I proposed my idea to professors, I did not know Rocksmith existed, they did not too, but yet again due to the scope of it and hearing that I was going to use a game engine to do it was interesting enough for them, so my proposal was accepted and with a real rare exception in my university: Having two instructors. 
 The process was painful, going over many many aspects like sound processing and game engines, two concepts that are completely unfamiliar with. But as I progressed, the feeling of achieving something started to kick in, went onwards and even took the form of being a scream, waking my flatmates up, when I first read the result for the played note: Success 
 I kept on working, to provide myself the thing that we call money. For a fresh graduate, the amount of money I was getting was luxurious. I could get whatever I want, even on a stupid level of buying in-game goodies on a regular basis. This started to disturb me. Not the amount of money I spend, not the stupidity of the things I spend it on (Or the amount on the very same approach), it was me living a life that do not satisfy me. 
 While on a smokebreak, just like that bulb above my head is turned on, a game concept came in my mind and I found my motivation, my path to follow. I had to do it, otherwise I would never forgive myself for skipping the chance when I had the possibility to follow it. 
 3 months ago, I shared these feelings with my project manager, asking for a permission to go part-time on my job. The amount of money I was going to get was going to be sufficient to have a modest life. I decreased my expenses, started to save money and got a permission from my company. 
 During this waiting period, I started to create the core parts of the game, bit by bit, small but repetitive steps and decided to document almost everything I do while developing for reference reasons. I searched for jobs in foreign countries(This one has some gf reasons) as my country is a dead place when it comes to game development, got refused from all. On some, I fulfilled all the requirements (One being a junior position) yet the reply was stating that I am not qualified enough (Which I believe my nationality has a big impact on, better state it as a requirement I believe). This increased my motivation since now I did not just had to bring this project in life, I had to be someone that they would want me in. 
 And today it was my last day as a full-time worker in my company. I have the motivation, I have the tools and finally I have the time to fulfill all I desire. This project might fail as a commercial project, but the experience I will have from it will be enough for me. All I lose is the money I could earn, save and buy stuff like a car, a house, hearthstone packs, dota items etc. which I can live without. Just wanted to share all this for those who did not have the courage (yet), those who have questions in their minds about similar stuff like this. 
 For those who are interested, this is the website for my project (Which is really really under construction) 
 
 This is the playlist I created for the tutorials:

"My boyfriend (let's call him Calvin) and I have been dating 6 months. This time around. 
 We last dated a couple years ago for 3 months long distance. He broke up with me because he said he couldn't handle long distance anymore. We later became friends and when he moved to my city we hung out a lot. He would always be really touchy/flirty and I would flirt back but be confused. My friends commented on how flirty we were. He asked me out but I turned him down, saying I couldn't date him again but if he was cool with it we could set up a friends with benefits deal. We did. 
 I broke off the relationship because I realized I was still in love with my ex before him (who I'll call Peter), with whom I'd reconnected in the time between the end of my relationship with Calvin and Calvin moving to my city. I dated Peter. I moved to be closer to him. We broke up. I moved back in with my old roommates. My roommate is Calvin's sister. He was staying at her (also mine now) apartment because he couldn't move into his place yet. So I was living with him and very shortly thereafter we started dating again. 
 Beginning about a month into our relationship, after Calvin moved in to his place, I started becoming paranoid that he was cheating on me or just using me for sex. This was based mostly on these facts: 
 
 We didn't hang out as much as we did in the first month. 
 Just before we started dating he told me that last year two of his girlfriends broke up with him because they found out he was continually hanging out with me.  
 We would hang out at my place, it would inevitably lead to sex, he would leave shortly thereafter. 
 We don't go on dates often at all. Less than once every two weeks. 
 He doesn't introduce himself as my boyfriend, he says he's my friend. 
 
 As for point 5, I've told him it bothers me that he does that. I'm really really bad at introducing people so I've never actually introduced him to anyone. When I brought it up that it bothers me when he introduces himself as my friend he said it bothers him that I don't introduce him, and he's been doing it to try to get me to correct him by saying he's my boyfriend. This conversation was a few weeks before Christmas, but I don't think he's done it since then. So that's that point resolved. 
 I've talked to him about point 4. Neither of us have a car, and both of us are incredibly introverted and don't like being around other people, so the dates thing I can kind of understand. Also both of us are really busy all the time so it's hard to schedule things. 
 As for point 3, I have a not so good history with sex. I told him I thought he was only interested in me for the sex, told him my story of a nonconsensual sexual experience with a friend of mine I'd been trying to avoid, and subsequently had a panic attack. He calmed me down and seemed really understanding and asked if I wanted to just stay away from sex for a while, which I did, though that's back on now. 
 I haven't talked to him about point two. I doubt he was dating someone else at the time we were hooking up. Bringing it up seems petty and unnecessary, I think. 
 The thing is, I also have a long history of depression and anxiety, which has recently (in the past year months) come back, and is worse than ever. I'm still convinced it was a major factor in the end of my relationship with Peter, though Peter says it had nothing to do with it. (He has issues of his own, including depression, but also while dating me realized he's gay.) I was fine mentally for the first couple months of my relationship with Calvin, but then things started getting bad again. I only told Calvin about the depression and such then because he kept asking me why I was so negative/down/quiet all the time. 
 I used to be able to just push aside the thoughts of Calvin cheating on me by reminding myself that I was probably just being paranoid, and that I have no proof. But recently (I think this may have something to do with the depression/anxiety, which has for the past two or three weeks been really bad) it's been getting harder to do that. And because of that the way I act around him has changed. I'm angrier at him, I'm meaner, I shut down and refuse to talk. I haven't told him about my paranoia but he's been asking me a lot lately why I'm mad at him. I just tell him ""It's nothing"" or ""It's not important"" or ""You'll just get upset"" and he sighs and gets frustrated with me. 
 My depression has become a big issue. Calvin keeps urging me to talk more to him about what's going on with me. I don't see what there is to talk about. He keeps trying to get me to talk to a therapist/priest/his rabbi and repeats that he doesn't know what he's doing and I need to talk to someone who does. I keep saying I want to but can't promise I will, then I only make really feeble not real attempts at doing so. He gets frustrated. I don't like to talk about the issue because I don't like to talk about my feelings and because our conversations on that topic are always incredibly circular and absolutely nothing gets achieved. 
 I feel like Calvin is withdrawing from me. He says he has a lot of schoolwork this semester and he'll be around less. I feel like he's cheating on me, or at best trying to slowly separate us so I become less attached so he can break up with me with minimal damage. Or my issues are just too much for him and he can't deal any longer. He's out of town at his parents right now and I texted him a really simple question about a movie last night, but he still hasn't texted me back. Usually we text at least once a day. I feel like I'm going crazy. 
 Calvin turns 20 this week. It's possible he's just having family time or has work to do or something else but  I don't know because he hasn't talked to me . 
 Am I crazy? Am I being paranoid? Or is this guy playing me?","I'm paranoid that my bf is cheating on me or preparing to break up with me, but I don't know if that's my depression and anxiety talking or if it's real. Should I tell him about this or will that make things worse?",20,M,relationships
"My mom and dad have always been very strict with me. It wasn't until I got my car that they were more lenient with me up until recently. I just turned 21 in April and my older brother[32] moved out with his wife about a month ago. Due to my brother moving my dad has asked me to start paying rent, which I have no objection to. He's asking me for $100 per paycheck. Fair enough. 
 Now the problem. I've always been the goody goody girl throughout life. I've always listened to my parents and did as they said and never questioned it because I thought it was normal. I don't typically go out much except on weekends due to school and work. When the weekend finally rolls around and I want to go out I'm constantly getting texts from my parents to ""come home. Isn't late enough?"" etc. It was once a Friday and was at my cousins house and I got a text from my dad at 9:30 saying it was late and to come home. 
 About a year ago I met a guy and he's absolutely perfect. We haven't gotten into anything serious because he can't handle the way my parents control my life. Last Saturday I was supposed to meet up with him and my dad told me I was not allowed to go out. He was really upset at that and has pretty much stated he doesn't know how I can just accept the fact that he still treats me like a child but wants me to act like a responsible adult who pays all her bills (I pay for my car payments, car insurance and school. Soon to be rent also.) 
 I've never been able to sleep over a friends house. I haven't been able to go on any trips with my friends. I hate getting invited to all these fun places (people have even offered to pay for me) and it's an automatic no from my parents. 
 Today I'm planning on giving my dad $200 for rent but before I do so I want to have a talk. I'm pretty much going to give him 3 options. 
 
 I will clean, pay rent, cook everything I don't care as long as he treats me like an adult not a child. 
 I'm just going to rebel against his wishes. 
 I'm moving out. My friend is looking for a roommate. 
 
 Is there anything else I should add to this? Anyone with former experience from this have any suggestions?

"Decided to combine a couple topics into one supertopic. Sorry for the wall of text. This is the longest post I've ever made...  ONTO THE SHOW! 
 My badge said 65 days. 65 whole days since my last PMO, the last day of November I officially started NoFap. 
 I've had mostly good days, with a notorious series of urges around my first clean week, but for the most part I had it under control. Within a couple weeks, I had noticed improvements in emotional stability ( mostly  unfazed when a girl told me she had a boyfriend), confidence (noticed a lot of looks from girls), and overall improvement in social situations. I've had about 4 wet dreams, each about 1.5-2 weeks apart. 
 I visit the NoFap sub regularly, but overall I am too busy with course readings to even think about porn. Everything was good. I was hoping to finish my third month and round out 90 days. 
 I thought I was in the clear after 30 days, then 45, then 60. This time I couldn't sleep and I was driven to browse a NSFW sub, and long story short I relapsed, losing my star badge :( . I think I know why though: I've been doing some last minute rearranging of my schedule, so my class and sleep schedules are all messed up. Not a good thing. I've also been having some anxiety: I've been hanging out with this girl, and earlier this week over the phone I asked if she had Valentine's days plans, and I feel like I botched the delivery. She didn't explicitly say no, but that she  might be busy . I like being friends, but I feel like I may have ruined that. I could also be completely wrong about that, but it's the not knowing that's the killer. It also doesn't help that I've never had a girlfriend, so zero experience with this kind of stuff... 
 So yeah, that's where I am. I'm probably going to talk to her upfront and settle this like a man. I'm also going to  finally  resume a workout routine and get back to a healthier diet. I've been slowly taking back control over my life, but it's time to step it up. 
 I think that for the most part, I'll be fine. With the bar set at 65 days, I know what to shoot for. Everyone falls down sometimes, right? Thanks for reading this far, and I hope that everyone here continues on their journeys despite any pitfalls you encounter. I would've written even more, but it's 2AM and I have class later.","improvement after 65 days, relapse, moving on",20,M,NoFap
"As the title says, I (19F) have been with my girlfriend (also 19 female) for a year and 2 months or so. Right now we need to know if a break up is the best option for us, and we thought we would try to find someone unbiased to help us out in making the choice. 
 For the first 8-9 months of the relationship, things were perfect. We were both extremely happy with each other and trusted each other 100%. During those 8-9 months we both came out and told each other huge problems going on with both of us. Some examples of that was that she was the first person I ever told about how I was sexually assaulted, and I was the first person she ever told about being transgender (mtf). We were both supportive of each other, encouraging the other to start going to therapy and work through our issues. 
 But in the past few months things have been going downhill. We've been arguing a whole lot more, and sometimes it's just about stupid stuff. Our communication has been getting worse and worse, although we still can talk rationally about stuff and that's why we decided to post here. Whenever we visit with each other our visits seem to be one part good and two parts bad. we hardly talk or text anymore, and when we do its mostly us arguing. The bad in the relationship is getting unmanageable, but the good is what's making it seemingly impossible to let of each other. 
 In my point of view, there are more cons then pros right now. In my girlfiend's point of view, the pros and cons are about equal. We both agree that the cons are that we have poor communication skills, we have very few shared interests (video games, pets) and that we just feel disconnected from each other. The pros are that we love each other, can be happy around each other/enjoy our time together and we support each other.

"After a long history of both recreational use and blatant abuse I have plenty of regrets, but I'll share this one as it's probably the one that got the closest to killing. Let's rewind some years. It's high school and I'm in the midst of finals week and though I'm doing fairly well in all of my classes I'm still as nervous as a cat in a room full of rocking chairs. For focus and peace of mind I had started taking adderall about a week prior. Not in excess, at least yet, but still a bit more than those recommended doses. About 60mgs to those of you who are familiar with the drug, nothing serious. It wasn't the first time I had used the drug, but it was the first time that I had used enough of it to get those beautiful euphoric rushes that made all of the droll material that I was forcing my eyes to drudge through seem bearable, interesting even. The second day into finals week I decided to experiment past my 60mg cap and go to 90. This felt even better and not only was I studying and testing even more productively, but I was beginning to enjoy the entire finals process of cramming and testing. Day two passes perfectly. Day three will be my hardest though. I need to stay up all night to do some serious studying as it's my hardest and least favorite class, AP Chem. So sure, another 30 should keep my going well through the night. Well tolerance is a bitch, it doesn't. I step it up to 60mg by 4 AM. Now I'm flying, feeling great from the feeling of my heart pounding like I'm in the midst of a good fuck and the feeling of the blood rushing through my veins. 8 AM rolls around and I'm starting to feel a bit fatigued and strung out. I eat and drink, but I'm still not right and as able feeling as I would like to be. That's when I made a very painful mistake. On my drive to school I take another 90mg. Now I'm not that big of a guy, and at the age of 16 I wasn't too smart either. Anyways, I get into school and take my final. Did decent, so I suppose I'll meet my friends in the lunch room to wait for my second final of the day. I get there and I notice that my heart is beating unusually hard. Scary hard. I ignore it for several minutes, then it begins to hurt. The pain spreads from my chest outward into my arms, legs, and back. The pain is so unbearable that I can't stand. The way it feels is somewhat like what I have read the bends to feel like. All I knew was is that something was not right and that there was a California forest fire raging in my veins. I'm unable to make it to my last final. Seeing that I had overdosed or something, and being this shining student and ""good"" kid, I refused to seek out help and make public my rising inclination to drug use. So I locked myself in the school's dark room, a room to which only I and one teacher who never used it had keys to. As I lay there, sweating profusely on the ground, I was convinced that this red lit room filled with the smell of fixer would be my tomb. I thought to myself, ""Really? This is the last smell I'm going to experience? Fucking fixer?"". But it was soon before I was begging for death or at least for the pain to stop. I lay there for about 3 or 4 hours, not really sure. Only things in my little tomb that had hands were exposure timers. But eventually the pain subsided and I was free to walk away from it. I'm not completely sure what happened to me, or if anybody else has had this experience, but I seldom talk about it and have never really inquired as to whether or not anybody else has had a similiar experience. But I learned a very important lesson, don't push it. Especially with speedy drugs.",Don't fuck with adderall.,16,M,Drugs
"Good day everyone, 
 I'm 28/M 170cm. I started on my keto journey 2 weeks ago and on the first week I saw I lost 4kgs to 71kg which I attribute to water weight. After week 2, I'm on the scale once again to see that I've maintained at 71kg. 
 I started this journey to find out if this diet will be the one that changes everything. I have raised cholesterol in my blood work and mild hypertension. From what I read online, there are people who see improvements to these conditions on top of losing weight. 
 I started counting macros way in the beginning and now I go with guesstimates of roughly how much calories I'm eating (I set myself to a deficit of 1800 per day). I'm focusing on taking in as much oils on top of meat as I can during a meal. 
 My typical meal is (they are all Low carb and/or made purely because I saw it on websites with keto recipes): 
 Breakfast: bacon and broccoli muffin OR bacon, 2 eggs and 1 pieces of pumpkin bread. 
 Lunch: oven baked chicken breast or thigh or salmon with one tree(?) of broccoli or cauliflower which is around 200g mixed in a knob of butter. 
 Dinner: oven baked lamb or salmon or pork with broccoli or creamed spinach. 
 What I'm wondering is, how long does it take before one sees progressive result? During week 2 I did eat out a bit (about 5 meals) which included Chinese roast chicken, duck and pork (because of all the fats and oils), KFC fried chicken once, mixed shawarma and the salad without the wrap once and Japanese which I opted for grilled items and salmon and avocado salad. 
 I have also increased my gym sessions to 3 times from the usual 1-2 times per week. I'm usually lifting and do next to no cardio. 
 Is my eating out ok? Heck, is my normal meals even ok? Or could it be my gym habits which I pray is muscle gains? Do I  really  have to count calories and macros like crazy? 
 Any feedback would be much appreciated! Thanks for reading.","Started keto for 2 weeks, seem to plateau, don't know if anything is working.",28,M,keto
"On it's one year anniversary, I've decided to come full circle with this.  I had gonorrhea, and it's gone now.  Background:  I am a straight male in my 20's. 
 First off, the STD gonorrhea is a bacteria.  Unlike viral STDs such as herpes and HIV, gonorrhea, like syphilis, can be wiped out with antibiotics. 
 How I got it is unusual.  The three ""suspects"" from whom I received this terrible gift were tested as negative, so I'm very confused as to how I got it.  The partner I was with at the time had only given me oral sex.  I had not gone down on her, or had any other method of transfer.  The last partner I had was six months prior, the one before that was about two years prior.  I contacted each, and they tested negative.  They were both pissed off at me, not realizing that they were equally likely as carriers, and I didn't have to call them.  But a year later, I still speak to both. 
 I have to say, for such a scary-sounding disease that carries stigma, it wasn't so bad after all. 
 The (not-so-graphic part):  Symptoms at first were a slight burning while peeing.  I thought I got soap in me after showering, hence the burn.  But it become like pins and needles, so I knew something was wrong.  Within a day, something felt seriously wrong:  A had a white discharge, a gunky white goo (like cottage cheese) inhabiting the inside of my junk, and I had to pee burningly all the time. 
 I saw the doctor after the weekend.  She did some sort of swab and gave me some anti-biotics.  Still hoping it was some sort of urinary tract infection, I was distraught when she told me she suspected gonorrhea.  I asked her about oral, and she said while it isn't common, it certainly can happen. 
 ""OH FUCK"" I thought, ""I CAN NEVER HAVE SEX AGAIN!"" 
 Fortunately, I was wrong.  She explained that it would go away after some pills.  A few days later, she called me and confirmed the tests were positive, and prescribed me a powerful one-off antibiotic.  From start to finish, all symptoms were gone in two weeks.  By the end of the first week, it wasn't even so bad.  Peeing got easier and less frequent, and everything recovered.  It is gone from my body, and I could not contaminate anyone else. 
 I'm not sure if there are any questions that can follow, but feel free to AMA.","I had gonorrhea.  It wasn't so bad.  I don't have it anymore.  Go to the doctor if you have similar symptoms, because it can cause damage untreated.",20,M,AMA
"Ok so I'm a senior this year and need an internship. I'm an IT major, not CS but really enjoy programing. I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on OOP from my Ruby and Python classes and always was one of the better coders in my programing classes, better then many of the CS students. 
 I got an email from an advisor for a programming internship that focuses on Python, so I applied and sent in a resume. Within about an hour I got an email with a few code jam questions. One to re-order a set of numbers (123 => 321, 221 => 122, 1230 => 321). The other was a 'next largest number' (11234 => 11243, 142 => 214). It took me about 30/40 min and o sent it back to him. The next day I had an interview. 
 He said I did ""slightly above average"" on the code jam questions. I didn't account for negative numbers, but he said no one that he has given it to had. 
 So in the interview we talked about what I knew, did a few situational based general interview questions. And he told me what the company did. 
 Basically, he was doing freelance work on the side (still has a normal job that he works remotely). He was sick of being at home all day and needed an office, so he got set up at a startup incubator near my campus. He realized many of the companies in the incubator needed tech work done, so he added that to his load. He figured it would be great to get some interns to help him, also, its paid. 10/hr 10 hr a week. 
 So he was talking doing things like this... A guy has a sensor that he sends down a pipe with a manometer and accelerometer. He already wrote a script that graphs the data for the guy. Now the guy wants a 3D rendering of the pipe. I was like ""I've only ever worked in the console....never anything graphical like that..."" 
He says ""oh its easy, well just use openGL or something.""

"I was on a high school graduation trip to Cuba with open bar. It was Canada day(July first) and the travel company had given us canadian swag to wear. So i`m rocking a canadian flag as a cape and calling myself Canada-Man. I'm pretty good at chugging large amounts of liquor with ease. So my friend gives me a cup full of vodka with probably 7-9shots in it and tells me to drink it but I didn't have chase so I went to the bar. A girl in line notices my cup and dares me to drink it, I explain that i will in a minute I just need some chase but she calls me a pussy. So in an instant I drink it. We start talking and we had an instant connection. She polished my name and said I should call myself CanaMan instead. We ended up going to the resort club together and had a great night dancing and making out.
Near the end of the night we were at the bar trying to get drinks but the bar tender wouldn't serve us because she was still 17, even after i offered a 20CA$ tip :( I remembered I had a 40 of vodka in my room and asked if she wanted to drink up there. On the way up we started taking our cloths off and never really made it to the 40. Sex was pretty good, thanks to my vodka dick so i wouldn't feel anything and lasted over an hour. Her and I had sex a few more times that week in places like on the beach, the ocean and the shower.

"Hey everybody, so this is a throwaway -obviously-. I've been lurking on r/sex for a while and I'm gonna admit, I've tried google/ r/sex and nearly every other search function I can think of but I've come up with nothing. So I've come to you guys for some help. Sorry beforehand about the insane rant I'm about to drop on you guys and thank you so much for even clicking on this. 
 I'm 25 years old and a girl. Just for a little background, I had my period super early (age 8) and therefore went into puberty way earlier than the people around me. Thus, I was horny as all hell during a time where guys and girls thought the other gender had cooties. As such, I started watching porn at age 9 and touching myself constantly (but I didn't actually achieve my first orgasm till I was 13.) I'm a 135 lbs and I'm a decently attractive woman. I don't really have any hangups about my body. 
 So when I had sex for the first time when I was 16, I didn't get off and I thought that was normal and it would change. Lo and behold it's been nearly a decade and I still can't get off with ANYONE. I've had a very active sex life and have had multiple boyfriends and girlfriends, all with (what I imagine) really good skills in bed. I've had a boyfriend who could much rather prefer to go down on my for hours at a time over anything else and it's just heart-wrenching to see them want to please me to the point that I've faked my orgasms 100% of the time just to get it to be over. 
 So here are some of the issues I have during sex (other than no orgasms) 
 -I can only really get wet the first few times with a new partner (the novelty is always hot). After I've had sex with them a few times, it's as if the faucet has shut off, been torn away and thrown into a goddamn desert. 
 -I get turned on, but only for the first few times. I like touching and I LOVE getting my partner off. I love giving blowjobs and I love making my partner come as hard as I can. I can spend ages just trying to explore the other person's body and I don't really have too many boundaries. Bdsm? Alright! Pegging? Lets do it. Rimming? Done and Done. Knifeplay? What's your safeword? But I don't like having any of it done to me. I'm not really a cuddler or an affectionate person. (I have been told however, many times that I'm the best lay they've had, and many times my one night stands turn into relationships) 
 -I usually lose all my interest in a person once I've slept with them. It's like a vicious circle in my head- ""They aren't gonna be able to get me off"" -""They couldn't get me off"" -""I don't want them anymore""-""I'll find someone new""(Rinse and repeat). What's horrible about this is that I've been in relationships where I adore the person and our interests all align and everything is great. We have a ton of sex at the beginning but eventually I start resenting them because they can enjoy sex so much while it becomes more and more of a chore for me-to the point that I actively start looking for reasons to break up with them. I stop communicating or trying to fix problems because- hey, what's the point of fixing relationship issues when I'm gonna break up with them soon? (Again please know that I never blame the other person, I understand that these frustrations are my fault) It's compounded by the fact that I don't usually crave social contact and I would rather be alone most of the time. (Although I don't know if this is because I can't get attached, or because I don't have fulfilling sexual relationships and that MAKES me not want social contact?) 
 Worst of all, because of the aforementioned reasons, I can enter and leave relationships at a whim. I have a very difficult time forming attachments because I'm pretty sure I'm going to be disappointed.  I've had my ex-boyfriend's mom call me because he wasn't sleeping or eating properly while I straight up forgot about him like an hour or two after breaking up. I know this is unhealthy but I don't even know where to begin to start fixing it? Sometimes it's even worse because I don't know if I want to fix it- or if its even fixable? 
 It's actually comes to the point where I can't fathom why ANYONE would want a relationship? I honestly get confused because for me guys and dildos are pretty much interchangeable. Actually, no, dildos are better because at least then I can get off. 
 To be clear, I can get off by myself easy. In fact, I can get off in 30 seconds sometimes and the worst part of it all is that I'm horny ALL THE GODDAMN TIME. Guys think about sex constantly? You got nothing on me. I pretty much consume a shit-ton of smut (erotic novels/smutty fanfiction/rule 34 imagery). I don't have a porn addiction (I usually prefer to fantasize and my fantasies haven't been vanilla since I was 18 or so) And as time goes on, I start only being able to fantasize to monsters/gay gangbangs and other really weird, bizarre fetishes that I'm way too humiliated to write down. 
 Oh and another point to make, when I fantasize on my own, I'm never featured in my own fantasies. Actually imagining anything done to me or seeing myself in my own fantasies does nothing. On that note, I can't imagine anyone I know or real people or even real circumstances. I sometimes read the posts that are titled ""I had to imagine my husband as Brad Pitt to get off and I feel guilty"" and it makes me want to cry because I desperately wish I had that problem. Actually, I'm not even sure I have a masturbation addictions as I think once every two or so days doesn't really count as an addiction. 
 Just the other day I was in bed for the first time with this really nice guy and he was really excited about us and literally two hours later when he wanted to cuddle I was trying to think up excuses to get him out of my house. I've been ignoring him for two days now and I know it's a shitty thing to do but I have no idea what to tell him because up until the sex, we were amazing. (And he was super diligent too- foreplay for almost an hour, eating me out, telling me I was gorgeous etc). 
 So these are just the issues at the forefront of my mind. I'm here because I'm at the end of my rope. I'm jealous of anyone whose turned on even half of the time with their significant other. I've read about rebooting from masturbation (but I haven't found any site that focuses on women - rebooting seems to be a thing that only works for men?) I've tried looking up how to rewire sexual fantasies so that I can at least masturbate to someone that looks remotely like a real life person but I haven't experienced much success? I've tried to lay back and just enjoy it (read above for boyfriend that could eat me for hours) and I've tried to just feel pleasure and not act out a porn scene but nothing seems to work. 
 Does anyone have any tips? I've looked nearly everywhere and I'm seriously desperate. 
 I want to have what other people have but I don't know if I'm too damaged to fix it? Is there hope? Or should I just give up and start hoarding cats and dildos? (Those two do NOT go together lol). What can I do? I would say this is ruining my relationships, but lets face it, I've been avoiding those like the goddamn plague. 
 Thanks for reading all this. I would","it but I don't think I could condense all this rage into a sentence or two. 
 Seriously. Any advice would be more than welcome. And I love you guys.",25,F,sex
"Using throwaway bc boyfriend knows main 
 First off, I really love my boyfriend and this is why it's so difficult. I can be totally honest and open with him and he is receptive and doesn't blame anyone. 
 My relationship with my boyfriend has been rocky for a few months, I really think we have issues with compatibility. The main problem however was a few weeks ago, when he pressured into doing something I did not want to do, and had told him before that I was uncomfortable. However he did it again, and it made me extremely upset and uncomfortable. 
 He came to me and profusely apologised and said he would, never, ever, do it again and he was going to actively work on being better. He took full responsibility. However, I was still upset so I went to break up with him. However, after a long 3 hour breakup/talk, we decided to stay together. 
 I truly believe he was sorry and he wanted to work on our relationship, but he said some hurtful things like ""I haven't felt this bad since my parent died"" and ""I am nothing and have nothing without you,"" which really influenced my decision in staying. He also has quite a severe anxiety disorder, and seeing him near panic attack for three hours near killed me. He really really wanted this relationship to work. He said he would do anything.
I am really in love, and he was willing to work on our relationship so I gave him another chance. 
 It has been approximately ~2 weeks since we decided to continue the relationship. There have been some ups and downs. We have talked through his dependence on me and why he felt the need to say such things during the breakup, our plans for the future and he has not done anything to pressure me at all. 
 However my health has basically deteriorated and I have begun developing depressive like symptoms. I believe that we should not be together and I need space and medical help to heal, and I think we should break up.  Right now we haven't spoken much, however he knows I am vary traumatised by the incident and is giving me lots of space. 
 My 21st birthday is coming up on the weekend (~5 days away) and his best friends are all invited along, along with a lot of our mutual friends, and my parents. 
I'm not sure if I should break up before hand or not? 
I do not want to string him along, and my friend says it's unhealthy. We still are on speaking terms, and I would be perfectly alright in having him in my presence, and enjoying the night with him. 
 The thought of all my friends and family asking me why he isn't at the party would easily ruin my night and mood. It is already traumatic enough, and I cannot repeat the story to everyone who comes. I understand that is very selfish reasoning though. I'm not sure what to do? 
 Also - I need some advice on how to actually break up, he is very dependent on me, and I still love him and i'm a huge sucker, I don't want to be dragged back into the relationship.","My relationship has been rocky for some time, and I feel as if I should break up with my boyfriend. My 21st is 5 days away and I'm not sure if I should break up now (to not string him along) or break up after (so I don't have to deal with our friends asking questions)?",21,F,relationships
"Me: 20f 
 I realized that the reason I cannot have a good relationship with the man I am in love with is because I am so afraid he will not love me for who I am that I force myself to never, ever put up a fight or take issue with anything, ask for anything, make a stand about anything because ultimately I worry he'll up and leave me; as though I cannot understand why he would ever be with me. What do I offer? I simply turn into a needy blob, calling, texting, whining and catering. It's interesting, because I can see our relationship developing positively whenever I feel more confident, and yet I cannot stop acting like a silly, needy girl. I want to call him right now and tell him how I feel but something is stopping me: fear. Fear of his judgement. Fear that he won't care, that he'll think it's silly, that I'll sound irrational. 
 My father made me believe that no man would ever love me. Really. He has called me ugly, fat, stupid, mean, useless, pathetic... you name it. The way he treated me, the way he treats my grandmother, and the way he has treated all the women in his life to date (including my mother) has taught me that women are lessors and deserve to be treated as such. My father is an insecure misogynist, prone to violence and irrationality. 
 It has almost been a year since I last spoke to him. Our relationship came to a violent climax and since then I have refused to acknowledge him or keep any contact with him, to my benefit. My quality of life has increased greatly since. I was also going to see a therapist for about three or four months, which had a very positive effect as well. 
 I want to feel like myself again. I want to passionately be in love with my boyfriend like I was a few months ago, and to unabashedly tell him how I feel and what he means to me. I want to be able to stand up for myself and communicate efficiently. But I cannot shake this subconscious insecurity over males. When I really like someone, I end up catering to them hand and foot because, well, I have such a low self-esteem that I can't imagine why they would ever be with me. 
 I am told I am very attractive... I used to be very passionate about politics, the environment, art, design, writing, but somewhere down the line I just lost it. I miss it. I miss having passionate interests. 
 I'm really sorry about the sporadic tone of this post, I'm feeling incredibly depressed and a lot is floating around in my head.","Severe insecurity majority caused by abusive father and poor upbringing causing me to be unhappy in my current relationship and life despite having excellent opportunities ahead.

"I have been a Nintendo fanboy all my life (there's still a tiny bit still there), but when I was 8 my dad bought us a 360 and a Wii. My family all started to play the typical CoD/Halo combo on the 360, while I kept to playing Mario and LoZ on the Wii. 
 As the years went on, I started getting really into the Plebbox360. I bought every single CoD and Halo, I even got my own Plebbox360 for my room, but then something just clicked.

"Sister and I are 2 years apart I am 28 and she is 26. When we were younger we were really close. Our parents didn't come from much money so we shared a room and had bunk beds. However, when we were younger my sister would often get scared so she'd ask me to sleep in her bed. I never thought much about it. (after I was in highschool it rarely happened) 
 After I got accepted into college our relationship was strained since my school was 2 hours away. My sister ended up going to community college. When I'd come home from school I'd notice she'd always be up in her room. We didn't talk much then but she said she was in a LDR. 
 Eventually about a year after graduating I moved into my own place. Started working there, at this point I rarely talked to my sister. However when I was like 26 or so, my sister got kicked out of our parent's house. She ended up moving in with me. 
 We became close again started talking turns out her online bf tricked her. Guy wasn't actually interested in her he just wanted to get nudes out of her (and a video). He eventually sent that to a lot of her friends on fb including our parents. Sister was spiraling in depression. 
 I helped her get a job as a secretary at the company I worked at. We were both working together things were great. I ended up getting a new gf, I noticed sister would get oddly protective of me when she was around. I talked to my sister about it. 
 Eventually found out sister hasn't ever been with anyone. She is 26 hasn't been in one real relationship she says she hasn't even been kissed by a guy. She says she is terrified of talking to other guys and I am the only guy she feels safe around. To add to that she says that she has had feelings about me since she was a little girl. 
 I tried taking my sister out to meet guys that didn't work at all. I tried to ask my guy friends if any of them would be up for it. One of my guy friends accepted, but when sister was out with him she felt really uncomfortable with the thought of him being around her. 
 At this point I checked the laws for our jurisidiction. Turns out consensual sex between siblings isn't illegal as long as we don't have kids. I love my sister more than anything in the world and I am willing to do anything for her. I have heard that sleeping with a family member only strengthens your bond.

"Me and my boyfriend are both in our early twenties have been dating for six months. We are pretty serious and have been through a lot in the small amount of time we've been dating. 
 I have some serious remnant trust issues from my previous relationship, which I feel are interfering with my ability to judge my current situation. Basically, my boyfriend has admitted to me that he lies in certain situations where he knows no one will get hurt and he is 100% sure he can get away with it. I also recently asked him if he lied about any similar interests that we may have had when we first started dating and he admitted that he did. I feel very deceived by this. I am honest to a T. I feel very uncomfortable and guilty lying and do it very rarely. 
 How do I determine whether I can trust my boyfriend based on the fact that he has told me that he tells small lies? Is the fact that he is honest now enough? I am uncomfortable with ANY lying, even with small lies, but I also realize that most of the world is not like me and does tell small lies. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated. Throwaway. 
 EDIT: To clarify, I have never caught my boyfriend lying to me. We have had several conversations already about my trust issues when I've been accusatory towards him for certain things, but I've never had proof that he was lying or couldn't be trusted.

"So my boyfriend (22 M) and I (23 F) try to have sex pretty often, but we're running into repeated problems. My boyfriend has trouble maintaining an erection, so usually we have sex for 15-20 minutes until he loses his erection. He is only able to cum maybe 30% of the time we have sex. We sat down and read the r/sex FAQ together for erection problems, hoping we could identify a cause. He said nothing on the FAQ stuck out to him. However, he's mentioned that he has trouble ""going over the edge,"" which I don't know how to fix. More importantly, he's also mentioned that it stresses him out that I can't cum because he thinks I don't enjoy myself. 
 Now I have never been able to have an orgasm in my life, with any body. I never masturbated growing up, and nowadays when I try, I get impatient because I don't have much sensitivity in my clit and I don't feel much. I even bought a Hitachi, but I don't get much pleasure from it. I also have mental blocks because I feel silly when I try to masturbate. So all of these things lead to no pleasure -> not knowing what I like -> no orgasms. It has nothing to do with my boyfriend. In fact, during sex I am pretty vocal and I tell him when things feel good. So it surprises me that he thinks I don't enjoy what he's doing. 
 I've asked him to see a doctor about his erection issues since the FAQ didn't help much. This is also because he is overweight, which I think contributes to the problem, but I would rather a doctor tell him that than myself because I don't want to hurt his feelings. But if the erection problems are because of my own lack of orgasms, then we are stuck! I know I need to work on my own issues, but it's not a quick fix. Plus I feel guilty asking him to see a doctor for his issues, when I have my own set of sexual problems. It's clearly causing him a lot of embarrassment, and myself some frustration.

"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 5 years. I’ll call him “John."" We both started dating when we were in high school. I was 15 and he was 17. We didn’t really get to know each other that well before we started dating, it was more or less a “you’re cute, let’s go out” situation. 
 There was about 2 months where we would sit together at lunch and talk to our friends while we flirted. He’s an extremely shy guy and his way of flirting was letting me talk about things that I found to be interesting while he remained stoic and practically silent about his feelings. Eventually, I had to ask his brother to confirm Johns feelings for me. His words were “my brother is totally in love with you.” That makes me feel stupid now because we were so young. We didn’t really know what love was, did we? 
 Thinking back on it now, I’m starting to realize there wasn’t really a dating period for us. We were high school kids with no jobs and no money to go out and do things together. We jumped into a relationship because it was all that mattered to most people in high school. I don’t think we thought about what we were getting into and just how huge of a decision it is to commit to someone at that age. 
 We dated all throughout the remainder of our high school days. He would come over and hang out with me to play video games and eventually he ended up moving into my house a year into the relationship. Parenting ethics aside, our families trusted us to be responsible. 
 I graduated high school and he ended up dropping out. I went on to a local college almost immediately and began working on my degree. Meanwhile, at my house, John would play video games on the consoles and computers my parents bought us all day long. I eventually asked him why he wasn’t going to look for jobs if he wasn’t planning on going to college right away. That's when he told me that he had some sort of a discrepancy with his social security card and his legal name. This would mean that he and his parents would have to fight with the legal system for the next few years to get it all straightened out. This was incredibly frustrating for everyone involved. 
 The next two years were spent finishing my degree while John sat at home playing games and going to appointments with his parents every other month or so. I understood that he couldn’t legally get a job at the time, but when I would come home at the end of the day to do homework, our bedroom would be filthy and he would be sitting in the chair playing Xbox. I would always say “I’ve been gone all day, you’ve been here, and you couldn’t even be bothered to pick up?” He would say things like “I’ll get around to it” but he wouldn’t budge and I would end up doing it myself at the end of the night. 
 This was hurtful for me in every way. I never wanted flowers or gifts because I knew he couldn’t buy them (I wouldn’t want those even if he could). The one gesture of “love” that I wanted was for him to help me clean the room and help me feel less stressed by taking that upon himself. It felt like he didn’t care. This, I believe, started to create some sort of resentment between us. 
 I graduated 2 years later with my associates. I finished completely debt free and I decided that I needed to work if we were ever going to get anywhere as a couple. I got a full time job at a financial firm and I’m still working there to this day. I was 19, he was about to turn 21. He finally got his social security card straightened out and he even got a driver’s license. I was so happy; it felt like a weight was lifted. I was proud of him. Now all that was left was for him to get his GED and start college. 
 He got his GED a few months later after a lot of procrastination and 1 night of studying. I felt like he didn’t care enough to do his best, but he passed it regardless. I’m not the kind of person who is content with the minimum; I enjoy putting in all my effort. He’s the opposite. He’s not very motivated to do anything other than the bare minimum. 
 After the GED, it was time to get registered for college. He put this off for months and now here we are, less than a month before the Fall semester will be starting and he’s still sitting at my house playing video games all day. He hasn’t even taken the required placement test to get in. If he doesn’t make the deadlines for this semester, at least he’ll have time to save for school; however, he hasn’t even shown initiative to find a job to do that. 
 I don’t know how to feel anymore. He’s nice and calm most of the time; however, he has a tendency to be lazy and self-centered. He can make me giggle even when I’m angry or sad. His presence has the ability to make me either upset or comforted and content. I used to be so nice all the time but I get frustrated so incredibly easily anymore. 
 I’ve started to have anxiety attacks every time I talk to him or think about the future. I don’t feel like myself. I say things that are so cruel to him because I want to see him react. He never reacts to anything I say. I feel like a nag and I don’t even like myself anymore. I say “I love you too” but I resent him most of the time. I don’t feel like this is really loved. I feel like we need some time apart to figure out who we are individually. Maybe we need to break up. Who knows? 
 There are just some problems stopping us from taking this time in our life seriously. My parents think that we should stay together no matter how messed up things get simply because of the amount of time we’ve been in a relationship. Every time I talk to my mother about how messed up I feel, she shames me into feeling like a terrible person for even thinking of him in a negative way. She’s even threatened to kick me out if I try to take some time apart from him. We have 2 pets together as well. They are like kids to us I don’t even know how we would decide which cat would go to whom. 
 Our families and lives feel completely intertwined and if we were to split up, I feel like my entire life would come crumbling down around me. I feel physically ill whenever I think about getting married to him or becoming pregnant on accident. I would feel so trapped and terrified. I feel like I haven’t even lived life for myself yet and I’m already being told to get married and have kids before it’s “too late.” 
 After all of these negative feelings, I try to picture my life without him. I can’t see a life without him. A life without John sounds terrifying and scary. I’ve “grown up” with him in my life, we lost our virginity to each other, he’s my second and longest relationship, and I can’t see myself lying alone at night. I can’t see myself coming home to nothing and no one. 
 I don’t know if I’m scared of losing him or just being alone in general. Will anyone want me if I end up alone? Is he the only one who has ever and will ever date me or love me? He says he loves me, but I don’t think he’s willing to treat me with the same respect and love that I would need in order to pursue a future with him. We have a past together and I feel like it would be the most intensely difficult experience of my life to separate from him. I’m turning 20 in a few days and I feel sick to my stomach knowing this is affecting my personal life so immensely. I’m just so fed up, frustrated, and just plain lost. I've communicated to him every word of what I've said in this post and nothing ever changes. 
 Please Reddit, help me reach some clarity that I can’t reach on my own due to being so emotionally invested in all of this. I need an outside perspective.

"A little background. I graduated high school in May 2012. It was an early college, STEM school. While there I took a few engineering classes; my favorite being Civil Engineering and Architecture. 
 After graduation I studied Mechanical Engineering my freshman year. I didn't really enjoy it that much. I took a year off (Fall 2013/Spring 2014) and did some rethinking. I spent several months doing CS on my own (Codeacademy, MIT/Stanford Lectures, How-to-Guides etc). I knew nothing of CS beforehand and had made decent progress for doing it all solo. 
 However, I sorta burned out. After a while, it got rather difficult and I didn't have professors, mentors, peers, grades or tests to guide/help me. After some more soul searching and family discussion, I figured I would enjoy Civil Engineering more, and thus declared it as my major for Fall 2014. 
 Lately, CS has creeped back into my life and I don't know what to do. I haven't touched it in months, but still feel like it's an optimal career choice; not because of money but mostly because it would give me to tools to create my own website, widget, etc and make a living off that instead of working 9-5. I realize becoming self employed from a website is a longshot but it's more like Plan B. 
 I definitely have more experience with Civil and feel like it is more intuitive to me. I planned on going into transportation engineering or construction/structural and perhaps take a Construction Management position.

"When I was maybe... 10, there was  the neighborhood girl who had a bit of a thing for me. She'd invite me over often to watch Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (the good one, this is the early 90's) and eat her snacks, to which I'd happily oblige most days. 
 Despite being older - I wasn't sexually interested yet, but I gave in to pressure to play doctor with her behind the couch a few times. She'd want to do this more and more often, until one day she invites me into her room (which I had NEVER been in).

 Meanwhile, The girl had closed and LOCKED her door, stepped behind me and the bed and was beginning to take off her clothes. I knew what she was doing, but I didn't really understand why, I suppose. I doubt she did either, as she was a year younger than me.

"This may be a bit long, forgive me. It's a little confusing and complex. As a slight background, I'm a 25 year old woman in Massachusetts. I was previously on MassHealth and then a Tufts Network Health plan. 
 A few months ago, I was informed my MassHealth had ended because I had not reapplied. They had my wrong mailing address on file so I never received information on this. I only found out it ended when I went to fill a prescription. I had moved frequently within the past few years, all within the Western side of the state, and because I am young and irresponsible, I figured I had failed to update my new address with my health insurance. 
 So filled with anxiety over losing insurance, I waited. Finally, through my new full time job, my employer offers insurance. I decide to get insurance through them, since I don't think I can have MassHealth as my primary insurance if my employer offers. HR asks when I lost MassHealth, as it may be past the 30 days to apply. 
 Today I went to see someone in a local hospital who works for Advocacy for Access, helping people with insurance and whatnot. I was planning on asking about if I qualify for MassHealth for secondary insurance and finding out when specifically I lost insurance. 
 I give her my social security number and she looks in the system. She informs me the system has my birthdate as 01/01/19XX, when my birthdate is actually 01/10. I knew about this for like a year or so, whenever I went to pick up my meds. I was young and figured it was a clerical error. I think at one point I had called to correct but I guess it was reverted back? I never really bothered with it because I was sort of crippled with anxiety... 
 So today. The Advocacy assistant tells me ""Looks like your insurance ended just a few days ago."" I find this odd, but am happy to hear the news. This means it's within the 30 days so I can enroll in my employer's insurance without having to wait till open enrollment. She says she'll print me a letter stating when I lost insurance to show HR. She prints it and the beginning of the letter has my name and address at the top. 
 But this is where it goes awry. That is not my address. I have never lived in this town in my life. I have lived sort of near there years before I ever got MassHealth/Tufts. 
 So they look up my SSN again and this address is popping up, along with a completely different phone number, and an entirely different primary care doctor. 
 So there must either be someone with the same name and born on 01/01, not 01/10, and someone my SSN was confused and this is on the health insurance administrative end, or my SSN was compromised and someone is using my health insurance? The letter had the same insurance member number as the card in my wallet, so I don't know how the other person is getting away with it? 
 The customer service number is closed for the evening, so I can't call to straighten this out until tomorrow -- thankfully I'm on vacation this week to sort this all out. So I thought I'd post here and see what I can do to help myself.

"My girlfriend (20F) and I (20M) have been together for two and a half years. We're both still in school and live with our respective parents. 
 As time has passed, we see more and more of each other. Now we see each other every single day. But this quarter at school I have class Tuesdays and Thursdays non-stop from 8:00am to 5:00pm. This mentally and physically exhausts me. 
 I have been a below 3.0 GPA student but I'm very close to it. I recently changed majors so I am playing catch-up. So because of all this, I've been wanting to come straight home because of how tired I am and because of the amount of homework I have (increased from previous quarters). The other days of the week I work until 4:00pm and see my girlfriend immediately after and spend the weekends with her. If I drove to her house then back to mine (she has no car) from school then it would take an hour and a half to get home on those days even though she lives close to me. 
 I explained all this to her today. She previously told me I should stay home these days. Today she wasn't having it. She got angry and said I haven't been trying hard enough. She said me being tired like an old man is not an excuse not to see her. I almost had a nervous breakdown last week because I didn't have time to relax and my brain felt fried when I saw her. She thinks I don't care about her any time I want some alone time. 
 If there's anything I've learned on reddit, it's that relationships require alone time. I get none of that. She gets a ton because she finishes school early and does homework while I work. Well today she got angry that I went home. She made perfectly clear her intentions to end everything for about the 7th time in the past month. Except this time she said ""Bye."" and the issue wasn't resolved. 
 My concerns are that this needy/attached behavior will never change and that she will always be angry at me (she gets angry very easily for the dumbest reasons such as me not comprehending her complex worded sentences). I also feel like I just frustrate her and she'll never trust me and let me be alone a little bit (I need a new post for that stuff). My problems with this ending are thinking of all the things we've done together, her family I've grown close to will be gone, I'll feel embarrassed in front of my family, and I can't imagine giving her stuff back and never seeing her again. We've talked about living together and getting married. I just can't imagine her being gone forever. 
 Just some information that may be helpful:
I've been very frugal lately because my income has decreased. This makes it hard for me to do fun things with her. I spend every cent on her. I can't even buy myself a pair of pants. I sacrifice my studies for her (I feel shameful of this). She just doesn't believe my stress is valid because she's ""had tougher schedules and harder circumstances."" She just doesn't understand that I need to be alone for 2 days out of the middle of the week to recharge and be more attentive when I'm with her.","What do you think is the best direction for this relationship? She thinks I don't care about it and has been so quick to say (but not follow through) that it's over for the past month. Will I ever be enough for her? Will she keep doing this and undoing it the next day? For now I'll be waiting for her to text me. I've sent two since she said Bye. and I don't want to badger her. I'll answer anything you all asks.

I was walking with my older brother to get some ice cream before the game and I saw the pitchers warming up and then I spotted Eric Gagne walking about 10 feet away from me. I sprinted over to him with a ball and sharpie in my pocket. I get to him and say, ""Mr. Gagne, can you sign my ball?"" He replies with, ""After warm ups"" Which was understandable. So I waited, I wanted this damn autograph. I waited 45 minutes, watching them throw a ball back and forth. Finally it was over and Eric Gagne comes out. I say again, ""Mr. Gagne, can you sign the ball please?"" And I hold the ball out thinking it would be easier for him to get the ball and sharpie. He goes, ""Get this outta my face!"" and backhands my ball out of my hand and onto the ground. I was totally distraught. My ball was still on the ground and tears were coming.

"I'm late to everything I ever have something to add, but I'll do it anyway. I had a bf when I was about 18-19 years old. He felt really strongly about hair, and he was completely uninterested by it.

"White male - 21yo - 180cm for 67kg 
 I'm a foreign student in California.
I find myself a little bit ""disconnected"" from the real world since a few months.
Sometimes, I realize that I completely forgot what I've just done in the last half hour. 
 For example, one of my roommates transferred me the money to pay the water bill earlier, we spent 20 minutes working out the transfer details, then I go sit at my desk, open my computer, see that I have received money from her and I have no idea why. 
 It's like someone else is taking control of myself, and then suddenly, I'm back. I'm not disoriented or anything, but I realize that I have no idea I completed some complex tasks a few minutes ago or why I did it. 
 I also forget stuff really often, like my phone or my bag on some place. 
 This never happened to me before. 
 I've cut alcohol a month ago (I used to drink a beer or two at the bar, but that's it), I sometimes smoke marijuana, maybe 2 or 3 times a week, I exercise around 5 times a week. I eat clean and sleep 8 hours per night on a regular schedule. 
 I've been feeling really depressed since June 2015. I was at my worst between August and December. I lost weight (force feeded myself to stay above 60kg), didn't leave my apartment or talked to anyone for days at time, I had a really hard time waking up in the morning and I would just lie down on the floor for hours sometimes. I continued working out during this time, going to the gym down the street was my only occupation for 5 months. I worked from home, so no one noticed. 
 I'm on the path of recovery since January. I haven't talked to anyone about my depression, I started feeling better when I moved to California to continue my studies (It was planned before my depression started), I still have shitty days where I don't want to wake up or go to class, but I do anyway because then people will start asking questions. I also don't wake up in the middle of the night anymore like I used to for months.","Frequent memory loss, like someone is taking control of myself for minutes or hours at a time.

"I have a ""maybe"" turning into a ""definitely not"" situation for you. 
 My wife and I are a little older than most couples who have been married for only 3 years, I'm 37, she's 38.  She is a widow, long story short, I was friends with her husband, actually was an usher in their wedding, add cancer, etc.  After he passed, I made it a point to spend more time with his widow to make sure she was getting on okay, well one thing lead to another and we fell in love.  Our friends saw it long before we ever did. 
 Okay, so when we got married in 2011, we were both open to children and actually had mentioned on our wedding web page that we were planning to reproduce... 
 Then something amazing happened, we spent more and more time together falling more deeply in love and really just enjoying our lives together and we started to expand our hobbies.  Dog, cat, and fish tank weren't enough, we added a horse and a harley and are currently contemplating a second horse. 
 So, we have had the conversation several times over the last year or two about not having kids and we always end up on the same thought, ""we love how things are now and don't want to change them that drastically""... we don't fear change or new adventure, we love to discover new things, but in a way that we control the terms a bit more than a baby would.

"Original: 
 So I went to see my dad and it basically went like shit. I caved, I fucking caved and decided fuck it, I'll see what he wants. Maybe this is something worth hearing. I visited the hospital by myself. Now wife. No mom. No sisters. Just him and I. 
 He looked old and tired and just as I predicted I didn't find it in me to be angry, this wasn't the man I remembered, this was just some old broken man. It would have been a waste of my time to feel angry and yet I did. I was so pissed off because I couldn't stand across from him eye to eye and let him see that the son he treated like dogshit had built a wonderful life for himself. 
 We didn't say anything to each other for around an hour. Then eventually I found my voice and said ''you know this is the last time we'll ever see each other right?'' No response. Then he replied ''I know.'' 
 So I asked him why now? Why did he want to see me so badly that he had to send a message through my mother for me? 
 And here is where I learnt that my existence was fuck all to him. He admitted that he did it just to give my mom closure, she didn't ask him to do it but he knew she wanted it. 
 So I asked him why he treated me the way he did my whole life and he replied,  ''I never wanted a son, never had any interest in one.''  It fucking hurt but I kept listening and he kept speaking. He said that in the first few years of my life he tried his best to care about me but eventually he realized he couldn't. Then came the final nail in the coffin of my relationship with that man. 
 I never loved you but I didn't hate you either, I just didn't care for you because I never wanted a son, I wanted to give you up for adoption when you were younger but your mother would never have forgiven me, so I did my best to push you aside and you would always try and get my approval for stuff, I felt bad at times but I just didn't care for you 
 By that time I was crying, me a 31 year old man, left my dying father in his hospital room and went to my car crying. I could have gone my whole life not knowing that. Fuck my mom, my sisters, my wife and my dad. I'm just so pissed right now. 
 There was a part of me that hoped we would bury the hatchet, nope, I just learnt he never gave a fuck. 
 I will never speak of my father again. I will not attend his funeral or visit his grave. When he dies I'll be at the bar drinking because the fucker is gone from this world and I will do everything I can to be the father he never was.","visited dying dad, found out he never wanted a son, wanted to put me up for adoption, didn't love me, didn't hate me, just never cared about me 
 EDIT:-   I just want to say thanks to everyone for your kind words, both in comments and pms, they really helped a lot, particularly while I was hung over this morning and laying in bed thinking about life. Also to the stranger who gave me gold, thank you, never had that before and it was quite unexpected. 
 I've got a ways to go still, I feel like yesterday opened up wounds I didn't even realized had never really healed and I'll be talking to my wife about it and most likely a professional as well. I won't cut my mom or sisters out, I am not angry at them, their experiences with my father were different from my own and I do not fault them for that, however, right now, the best thing for me, is just to not be around them as much. So I don't think they'll be seeing/hearing from me for some time. 
 Once again, I sincerely thank everybody, it was your comments and pms that made me realize, yeah it hurts like shit, but I can't let him have anymore power over me, I'm in the prime of my life and I've built a nice life for myself.

"Let me tell you about the time I bought a dead cat:
Okay, here is what happened. I was about 12 years old and there was a kid named Russel that pretended to be rich except he lived in the same trailer park as I did. He would take a bunch of ones and put a $5 bill on the outside in order to fool others into thinking it was all $5 notes.
Russel had issues, probably because his parents beat him for wetting the bed. I even caught him hiding in a pickle barrel during a game of hide-go-seek because I smelled piss. He was always pissing, ya know? At school, field trips, recess, at home, here, there, all the time, everywhere.
One day Russel decided to be a prick and tell the entire bus that he saw my dog humping me and that I liked it. That wasn't true, I only thought it was funny and then pushed my dog off. I swear it wasn't a feel-good time. I would never let a dog mount me for the excitement. Anyway....
I was angry at Russel and very embarrassed. Everyone was laughing at me and I had to get even with Russel McPisseshimself. My seething hatred boiled so high that I stooped to a new low; I would kill one of Russel's cats and the do something with it in order to exact revenge.
Come to find out, Russel's cat was just as wild as all the others in the trailer park. They were impossible to catch and quite ornery. But I had an idea that just might save this plan. I went to Blaine's house and asked him to catch a cat for me. Cats always hung around his trailer because he would feed them.
Blaine was a drunk, but still reluctant to do such a thing. Especially for some kid with no money. I begged Blaine and he finally asked ""Whatcha need a cat fer?"" I told him we were going to dissect them in science class. He believed me and said it would cost me. I asked him how much and he said $1 would suffice. I ran home and then returned with four quarters. Exact change.
Blaine said ""Aight."", sipped the last of a Keystone Light and went inside for a minute or two. Blaine returned to the porch with a pistol. I think it was a 9mm but it could have been a .380 for all I know. Blaine looked around for a minute as if he was going to choose the best cat for my ""science class"".
""KAPOW-KAPOW!!!""
Blaine shot a grey cat that was by the gravel road that ran the length of the park. I stood there astonished. ""Blaine is happy to help your learnin'. Might wanna put him in the freezer til' mornin."" I nodded and thanked Blaine for his kindness. It always struck me as odd how he would refer to himself in the third person. I guess that's what years of septic tank work will do to you.
I grabbed the cat by the tail and hauled it home. I didn't know what to do with a dead cat that had one of it's eyeballs hanging loose. So I threw it in a plastic grocery bag and put it in the freezer. The next morning I had finally come up with an idea. Russel was surely going to feel the pain.
I took the bag of dead cat out of the freezer and put it into my backpack. I got on the bus and sat behind Russel. I was teased again for letting a dog fuck me, but I ignored it. Once no one was paying attention, I retrieved the dead cat. Show time!
I reached under Russel's seat and slid his backpack toward mine. I removed the cat from the plastic bag as quietly as I could and transferred it into Russel's backpack. Once that was done, I had to quietly slide it back and act natural or my gig would be up. Everything went smoothly and no one noticed the drop.
Russel got suspended and sent to the school counselor for bringing a dead cat to school. Social services visited his home and the parents lost custody of Russel and his sister because they didn't have healthy enough food or clean sheets on the bunk bed. To be fair, the latter was definitely Russel's doing.",Dead cat shenanigans.](,12,M,AskReddit

"Well, I'm not quite sure what to do. Me (17m) and my girlfriend (17f) have been dating for a little over two years. 
 Our relationship is awesome for the most part. We have lots of fun together and she's basically my best friend. The thing is, she's started being friends with her ex again, and that really bugs me. It wouldn't be bad if there wasn't a backstory to it. 
 Backstory: 
 I started dating her basically the night she broke up with this guy. Her and I had been really close, so it was kinda expected. The ex popped up every now and then, but it wasn't anything to be concerned about. 
 Last December I was pretty depressed, and it was at this time that my girlfriend joined the ex's band. I was fine with it, since she really wanted to be in a band.  Eventually, she told me they had feelings for each other and it was because they never got closure.  They held hands before a show and he kissed her on the cheek, but that was it.  I told her that it had to stop and she agreed.  They were going to meet up to talk it out.  When the time came, he ""was too tired to talk,"" so they went to Steak N Shake and held hands. I broke up with her that night. 
 Two months later we're back together.  In the past month, it happened again.  I was gone for a camping trip and he called her the day after I left.  She said she was confused about how she felt, but he was into her.  They met up and he said he wanted to hook up.  She simply told me that ""She wasn't up for it."" (Red Fucking Flag right here, I know) 
 Present Day: 
 Now, she started talking to him again.  Once again, she says she doesn't know how she feels about him.  She thinks it's mostly excitement that he's back in her life.  As soon as I heard this, I said I needed space.  Two days later (so this Monday), she came over and I told her that I was prepared to walk away if she didn't stop her friendship with him.  She said that wasn't fair, but I've given her two years to work this shit out.  She broke down, saying she's treated me so poorly and what not.  I stood my ground and gave the ultimatum again.  She couldn't make the choice, so I told her I made mine.  Finally she said she'd do it, but she wasn't happy with it.  She said it would take some time to cut him out. 
 So, am I being unreasonable?  Should I let them be friends and risk it?  I feel like I should break up with her.  This all seems very immature.  Friends have said that she just loves the attention that she's getting from both me and the ex.

"Repost from a different thread, but it fits here as well. Keep in mind, it's very long. 
 When I was a little kid, my dad had a temper. He never hit anybody but he threatened my brothers a lot. He was this like, big scary Marine. He walked out on us a lot. He would leave sometimes for a few days and we were always helpless without him because no one had a job or a car, we were all too young/my mom couldn't drive. I was about 6 years old the first time it happened. 
 Since the first time it happened I've had this fear that he would just leave us, and I'd never see him again. 
 This happened last month, on the 11th. I'd heard him yelling at my mom and lately they've been arguing a lot, so I try to ignore it. But he has this one voice... it's nearly impossible to describe it, but even when I'm in a dead sleep if I hear that one tone in his voice, it can shoot me out of my bed and get my adrenaline going out of pure fear that he's about to leave. Normally it's very hard to wake me up, but that one voice... every time. 
 So I hear him yelling in that one tone of his voice and I'm worried and scared. I'm upstairs and he's on the stairs, and as I go into the hallway I meet up with him there. I'm trying to calm him down and for a moment it seems like everything is going to be okay. He yelled at me but at least I think he's staying. 
 I go into the bathroom to wash my face, and suddenly I hear his bedroom door slam open. He's leaving. I don't even have to turn around to know he's leaving. But when I do turn around, I see the backpack slung over his shoulder. I don't need a moment to even think, I simply run downstairs, only seconds behind him. 
 He's yelling at mom again, ""Are you happy now?! THIS SACK OF SHIT IS LEAVING."" and he slams the door behind him. Mom is yelling something like, ""Are you really doing this NOW?!"" and for a brief moment I'm stuck on the landing of the stairs, watching helplessly. The same way I watched him leave so many times when I was little and helpless. But a trigger goes off in my brain, I'm not helpless anymore. 
 I start storming towards the front door. It's only been maybe a few seconds after he's already closed the door. I vaguely remember calmly asking my mom, as I walked past her, ""What is he doing?"" and her replying back, ""He's leaving because I'm too sick to take care of myself."" 
 This doesn't phase me, I know that's not the reason. That would never be the reason. But either way I'm filled with rage that he's fucking leaving, again. He's leaving me here alone. Without a father. And I can't help but wonder if this time I'm never going to see him again. 
 So I grab the door handle, swing the door open as fast as I can and yell out ""WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?!"" 
 Imagine the sweetest girl you know. She's quiet and she's a little thing who doesn't know how to say what she means. She has trouble with emotions and doesn't understand how to properly convey them, so when she's angry, she's quiet and doesn't say anything. 
 Now imagine knowing this girl all 17 years of her life, she's never yelled at you once. She's never talked back, she's never even let you see her upset. 
 And now she's standing behind you, yelling in a voice that only reminds her of her father's own voice. Booming and so god damn military. I was that girl. I heard my voice echo along the street, I heard dogs barking a block away, I swear. And my dad turns around and he looks so-- so shocked, so stunned. 
 This part is still a blur, it's not even the emotional part. Sure I was full of bitter anger spilling out of me, but it softened when I saw the beat up, worn out look on his face. We exchanged words, soft words of comfort, words of ""Please don't leave, not like this"" over and over. My mom comes out but she's being a bitch, she's being herself and I'm completely ignoring her. 
 I have to stay outside though to feed the cats. I'm sitting on the cold ground, it's about 4 in the morning, and I'm shaking. I'm not shaking out of the chilly breeze that keeps blowing on me, I'm shaking at all the emotions I'm having, all the things I don't understand. 
 Ten minutes later I'm still shaking. I know what's going to help me and I don't like what it is. I knock on my dad's door, he's quietly laying on his bed, his head in his hand. He looks up when I enter and he looks like he's been crying. 
 At this point I'm spilling my guts. I'm telling him I'll be okay if he wants to leave mom, the word divorce never comes up but I'm implying it. I'm near tears and suddenly I can't take it anymore, and for the first time ever I just start fucking sobbing in front of my dad. Shit, it's bringing tears to my eyes just remembering it. 
 And he gets up really quick and hugs me, and I just keep saying ""I'll be okay, I'll be okay."" but I'm sobbing and he's sobbing. And I'm also telling him that I'm okay if he leaves, just not like this. Not out of rage and anger, not in the middle of the night. Just, not like this. 
 That, was the most emotionally difficult moment in my life. Practically begging my dad not to leave the way I've always feared he would.

 I found that when using it every weekend for a sustained period, your work suffers and you become a slower version of yourself, all the while stunting your emotional development until you stop for longer than a few weeks. When i met my (recently ex) girlfriend, i pretty much gave it up for a year, only did it occassionally and felt amazing. Breaking up sort of led me to do it every weekend for a couple of months, but i've now stopped and am about to volunteer in Africa. 
 I'm confident my usage will decline, if not stop, after i return home to Oz in October, just before my 30th.

"I'm shy to be trusting after having been chewed up and spat out. I've been excusing the idea of dating by ""focusing on my career"" -which hasn't really gone anywhere. Also I am socially inept, and just not into mind games and bullshit. I've been single [now for nearly 4 years]( I've had a few dates. I was set up on a blind date this year for NYE thanks to some friends.  I showed up to the gathering to meet this new exciting person at 10PM and she was already smashed. She threw up at 10:30PM and was taken home before 11PM. Happy New Year!! Same as the old year. I live in an area where there aren't a lot of potential lovers let alone lifelong worthy mates. I'm getting older and have even developed a nice balding spot on the top of my head. Shit. I'm not bitter though.

"My friend and I [16 F] met this guy [19 M] and his (fraternal) twin brother while standing in line for a concert. I was almost immediately attracted to this guy. When we started talking, I asked them what school they go to and they said that they were taking a break from school. My friend and I told them about how we were sophomores in high school (I was fifteen at the time). They thought that we were seventeen or eighteen. We realized our age differences, but that didn't stop us from our conversation and we had a good time at the concert as a group. 
 I was in a long-term relationship at the time, so I didn't think much of him until I became single. The more we talk, the more we realize that we had a lot in common, more than I ever had with my ex-boyfriend of a year and a half. He's less fuckboy-ish than guys at my high school, but he still thinks I'm attractive, just more courteous and respectful about it. 
 His nineteenth birthday came around and we started talking about the possibility of starting a romantic relationship. We're both worried about what other people and the law would say about it, but I talked to my aunt (who's raised me like a mom) and she thinks that it's fine because when I was a freshman in high school, he was a senior. 
 My sixteenth birthday has past and the age gap has (seemingly) closed again. I don't understand what people say that he's going to do to me, because I'm not scared of him ""deflowering"" me (I'm not a virgin anyways) or worried about abuse (I have already handled such experiences). I think that the worst that could happen is incompatibility and our relationship ending like anyone else's. 
 I feel that I'm more mature than most. I'm on track to graduate early, I've been through a lot of things that forced me to end my childhood early, including raising my (much) younger brothers. People say that those who think that they're mature, usually aren't, which I somewhat disagree with. 
 Feel free to ask me questions and whatnot in the comments. I'm not in any kind of rush, but advice would be really helpful.","He's three and a half years older than me, what should I do?",16,F,relationships
"Let me start from the beginning and its quite long so I apologize. I met my SO when I got my first job almost 2 years ago. At the time I had been dating my ex for 3 years. Me and SO lets call her Shelby became close friends. Since my ex (lets call her Sarah) lived 2 hours away for college I got to spend a lot of time with Shelby. Throughout the week I would see Shelby at work and outside of work. I would only see Sarah about every other weekend. 
 Fast forward, I had not grown feelings for Shelby only ever acknowledging the fact that she was very attractive. It had now become time for Sarah to leave for college again and I found myself not missing my gf of now 4 years as much as before. With her gone I started texting Shelby a lot more. It got to the point of asking about her sexual past, flirting, etc. We would stay up til 4 a.m. just talking. I had begun to fall for her. I knew that I should not have felt this but I did. I started seeing Shelby a lot outside of work. We would hang out, drink, and watch movies but always with a mutual friend involved lets call him Asshat. One night I came over just me no asshat and things changed. We began flirting, cuddling up close. I was unsure if it was just me or if what was happening was for real. I stayed the night and nothing happened. A couple days later we hung out again but this time with asshat and after it got late asshat left and we were alone again. I got up and wrapped my arms around her and she asked to talk in her room. We talked about how we had feelings and then we started kissing and that escalated to us having sex. She was the second person I have ever had sex with and the first person I had unprotected sex with. I was drenched with guilt. I had never cheated and I felt so ashamed I left work early the next day because of how I felt. I knew I couldnt hold on to Sarah anymore. I eventually worked up the nerve to break things off with Sarah but she wouldn't accept it or let me go. She pushed and pushed until I let her know the bare minimum (just told her we kissed). Before this Sarah was constantly guilting me about Shelby before there was even anything. She kinda of in a way helped push me into the arms of Shelby (and I know thats kinda of fucked up to say its just how I feel). I told Shelby I wanted to be with her and I just needed to break up with Sarah. I dragged it out for over a month. I kept both of them on my hook, I didn't want to but I was too much of a pussy to break every tie with Sarah. Eventually I did it and me and Shelby were back to hoping on each others socks. She requested that I no longer talk to sarah and not be friends with her. I agreed but I still talked to sarah behind Shelby’s back because I didn't want to let go of my former bestfriend/gf. Eventually she found out and was crushed. The pain from me lying and just the rough beginning with me dragging things out hurt her. But I apologized my ass off and I truly was sorry and she forgave me. We continued having amazing sex and wonderful days together. Not too long after Shelby blind sided me. She said that she was just too hurt about our beginning and she wanted to be just friends and focus on finishing school (over a year to go). I was crushed I had ended a four year relationship for this girl and now I had nothing. I freaked out and didn't know how to handle it. I tried surprising her with flowers and gifts and tried convincing her that it made sense for us to be together. One night I came over to leave her flowers and her car was there but she was not. I texted her to see where she was and she was at a movie with asshat that we all agreed to see together. This shocked me and even though her and asshat had seen movies together before I was in the picture it still felt weird to me especially since asshat lied to me about his plans earlier that day. Then I came up with a desperate attempt to get her back after many other failed desperate attempts. One night after I went to a concert with asshat I came over and suggested a FWB option. She looked intrigued and I made my move which then resulted in sex. 
 I was so overpowered with joy. I had now wiggled my way back into her life on a romantic level. After a little bit of time it reformed itself back into a form of dating. She said she didn't want this to happen but it just did and there was no objection. We had grown stronger in our feelings than ever before. We talked about the possibility of living together, marriage, etc. We were great but then things started to change. We went from the having sex multiple times a day, everyday to sex once every three or four days. It bothered me a lot but she assured me it was just because she was tired and I never let her relax I just try to jump straight to sex. This was probably two or three months ago and at this point we had been (since the beginning) well over 6 months. Now this past month sex had decreased to almost nothing for two weeks. Now even though we weren't having sex everything else was damn near perfect. We hugged, kissed, cuddled, and did everything together always expressing our love to each other. Finally earlier this week Shelby said she felt like she had some problems. This again felt like it was out of nowhere. She said I did nothing all day as I had just lost my job (due to complicated reasons) and that she felt like she was taking care of me like a mother would. She also said she would like me to start asking permission to come over and not just assume I can always be there even though I had a key to her apartment. I was shocked but I agreed to work on it. The next day we had sex after almost two weeks without it and I was feeling good. I thought ""we are working out the kinks and everything is gonna be okay"". Then she went out with friends the next night including asshat and during that time asshat betrayed my trust once again. About 3 to 4 months prior to this night Sarah came up to my work to see me and I didnt tell shelby about it to avoid the past complications coming up and I knew it was not a big deal and I didn't want her to think it was something bigger than it was. I had told asshat not to tell Shelbey and he agreed not to. Now fast forward to this night and asshat told her. She was hurt mostly because I lied to her. She came over and said she was really hurt and I apologized a trillion times explaining my poor choice but why I did it. She asked to have some time to think. I agreed but I freaked out again. After a day or two she said she needed to be just friends once again. We talked for a very long time and I had no control we were broken up once again. 
 She has since told me she still loves me and she doesn't want to date anyone right now and just wants to finish school now only one semester to go. Shelby also said she thought I needed to work on being alone seeing how I spent everyday with her and waiting for her if she worked. She keeps saying if it is meant to be it will happen. She also hasn't fully committed to trying again after school is over or just sometime later. She just responds with ""It depends on if things get better or not"". She has expressed that she can not lose me as a friend and that would destroy her but I really want her as my SO. After reading a lot of stories on reddit I am starting to lose faith that I will end up being with her again. I know I fucked up not telling her about Sarah coming to see me and all the past stuff but that is nothing you can't work out. I am unsure of what to do at this point. She is getting frustrated and angry anytime I bring up our relationship and keeps saying lets just be friend not even with benefits. What do you guys think and also on a side note, do you think asshat is trying to get with her? Also some side notes: I feel so lonely and bored now that I am a lone these past few days when I used to be with her 24/7. I did have a problem before with her and asshat always texting and she assured me there was nothing to worry about (I believe she has no attraction to him but I don’t know of the other way around). And finally a note about Shelby, her parents didn’t know we were together at any point and I’m pretty much a secret except to her 1 year old niece. She has met my whole family and only about 10 friends or so knew about us since the FWB.

"Hey /r/relationships! Bare with me, I'm on mobile, and I thought it would be better to just type out what I was feeling with almost no editing.   I just kind of want someone to read and give me an opinion/advice. Or what ever you guys think 
 So I'm a 18m, i just finished my sophomore year attending college, and I have a job as a student worker, and at a local grocery store. To be perfectly honest, I'm a cold analytical, logic based person, who is total honest and brutally realistic. I know I'm permanently in the friend zone with this chick. 
 I was homeschooled, and I haven't had a girlfriend, or even kissed a girl. I'm really lonely, I have a shitty home life (time for that in a different post) and only a few friends. 
 There's this girl (21f) who works right next to my dept. at college, and I occasionally work in that dept if my boss has nothing for me. She is awesome, smart, funny, hot, and she gets me. no this isn't my first crush. 
 I decided to make my move, got all dolled up, walk in to talk to her, she runs up to me and says ""guess what?"" 
 Me: ""what?"" 
 Her:""I got together with my crush today! I'm so Happy! "" 
 Me:""oh.... That's great."" 
 I was sad, but I don't feel things deeply (for example: (when I was 13) we had to get rid of my first dog, I cried for 5 minutes, and then I was fine). so I decided, I still wanted her as a friend. And I decided to use this to better myself. Get back into track, wear better clothes, start working out, take better care of myself. basically, taking a page from the good ol' reddit hit the Facebook, gym up, and delete the lawyer. I don't go on facebook much, and I don't need a lawyer, so gym up it is. 
 Mistake: Then my genius of a brain decided to ask her to run with me, she said yes, and wanted to take her boyfriend with us, too. I think I'm going to abandon running with her, and do it solo. But I like running with a partner, and none of my other friends want to. Ugh. No my uni doesn't have a track club, before someone suggests it. No I can't start one. My job precludes me from being a president of any clubs. 
 I've been trying to focus towards meeting new ppeople (read that here) rather than just girls. But I can't. I don't have hobbies. The hobbies I do have are single person/professional development. I master a subject, then drop it. 
 The other day, I saw her and her boyfriend kissing, and that hurt. that is what I can't forget. I can control everything else, but walking towards my car and seeing them is still in my mind. Am I being weird? 
 Should I just move on? I will see her (minimum 3-4 days a week) and she always wwants to talk, and gives me a hug every time she sees me. She says stuff like ""your my best friend"" and ""your like a brother to me"" 
 There aren't that many girls at my college either (it is a smaller college with a large amount of older people attending). The split is something like 60/40 and 40% are over 40 (probably not gunna date them).","crushing on a girl, friend zoned, and now looking to move on, but not finding other girls",18,M,relationships
"One thing I pride myself on is the fact that small little gestures and people's responses I notice and I am able to read people relatively well. Just a little background on me, I'm a 21M going into my 4th year in university. We'll call this girl Candy. 
 &nbsp; 
 I've known Candy since first year, but we didn't really talk or hangout until this year. We studied a bit together before exam season hit. We started to study together every day and slowly we got to know each other. 
 &nbsp; 
 I've never really been one for a relationships (never been in one), but it seemed like being in one would hinder my independance. I asked her about if she wanted a relationship or not, and she said no. I'm the type of person to (want to) date someone after getting to know them, and she seemed like someone that I would want to go out with. I got a mutual friend who I usually study with to help dig up some more info. Candy said to my friend that she wasn't looking for a relationship at the moment, but without prompting, brought my name up and said that she'd have to think about a relationship between us. 
 &nbsp; 
 There was a movie that I wanted to see (that she had already seen) and when it came to our uni's movie theatre, i asked she she wanted to go with me, as friends (she didn't know i liked her at the time). She said yes. 
About a week before the actual movie, while she was leaving, I asked if she wanted to go to the movie as a date. She said ""Let me think about it"" and left. I asked her a couple days before the movie and she said as friends only. I never asked for a reason why she declined me and to this day, still don't know. 
 &nbsp; 
 We're still friends and text, snap, etc. each other, but I feel like there's more to this. We only got to really talk in April and since then, she's told me things that she hasn't told some of her good friends (so she tells me). As well, one night, she drunk texts me, going ""I miss you, life isn't interesting anymore"". 
 &nbsp; 
 I messaged Candy to watch a movie with me that we've both been wanting to see. She asks if she can bring a friend and that's completely fine. When entering the theatre, she was the first in line and the seating arrangement would've ended up her, her friend and I, but somehow she ended up between her friend and I. As well, when dropping her back to her apartment, after saying bye, she came back to say ""Thanks, I had fun"".

"So this girl (21) and I (20), have been dating for about six months. Overall we have had a great relationship, we both trust each other, we have A LOT in common, we do almost everything together, and I do love her with all my heart. The problem is though, I am her first serious boyfriend and she doesn't know how to communicate. If I ask her something about us, or bring up something that has been bothering me, her immediate response is ""I don't know"", and she never wants or is willing to talk about it. 
For instance, right now I am out of town for two weeks due to tonsil surgery, and she hasn't started a conversation once. She didn't even ask how I was doing after surgery, I had to call her. So when I brought this up to her last night, and asked what was going on, her response was ""I only miss you sometimes, and I don't know why I don't text you"". 
Now I have been as patient as possible with the whole thing, not pushing her to tell me things, trying to help her with how she can communicate with me. But the one time I have pushed her for an answer she said she felt like ""something was missing"" and how I am her first real boyfriend and ""falling in love with [me] wasn't what she expected"". 
So I am really at a loss here, I love this girl to death, my life would be quite empty and boring without her. But if these communication problems we have been having continue, I don't think our relationship will. It really seems at the moment like she has an indifferent attitude towards our relationship.
So do you fine people have any suggestions of what I can do? Or is it a hopeless cause? Because I really don't want to lose her.","Girlfriend doesn't know how to communicate and it is causing a little resentment in me, any suggestions of what I can do?",20,M,relationships

 (Read last section to skip my rambling) 
 My name is Trayne, I live inCalifornia and I've been playing blizzard games since I was 5 years old. My experience with Starcraft started on my 5th birthday when my cousins got me Starcraft:broodwar so that I could play with them at lan parties, ever since I've gotten every blizzard game they made and kept the tradition going by bringing in more of my family into Starcraft when they reach a certain age. 
 More recently with Starcraft 2's release I found out about the wonderful world of e-sports. The first event I was able to watch was rather late into Starcraft second cycle it was dreamhack winter 2011, I was enjoying the tournament on its own and the casters were more than enough to draw me into the experience but when hero took the stage after it was all said and done, just the reaction from him showed me how much of a big deal this really was. After that I was hooked, I was getting my hands on everything I could watch for the next week after dreamhack I went through 100's of vods from day 9's king of the beta, TB's shoutcraft, old MLG clips you name it, through this I learned of all the community casters and shows - Will cheese fail, Funday monday, SoTG, ITG Live on three, Kings of tin - just to name a few. Ramping down to a close here, in early 2012 there was a call for a sc2 related audio only podcast, there was a lot of support saying they would listen but I found only 5 or so other people in that thread who said they would actually put  some content forward. After reading that I decided the worst that could happen is that they say no, So I put together a 30 minute recording mostly of a recap show for tournaments and drama in the community for that week. After about 3 days I heard back from them saying they Liked my voice but I lacked direction so I should pair up with some people to give the show structure. After that point I was paired up with 'How' and 'Treetop' (Don't think i should give out real names) as well put into a skype group of about 40 people all of witch were creating content and I still have about 4 weeks of recorded podcast talking about WCS and GSL or any other drama going on around that time, The content was good enough and there was plenty to go around however the planning done by the people in charge were not ready to go as soon as they thought so after delaying and pushing back the project for around 2 months the group started to fall apart. 
 Almost done here, The last section doesn't really explain why I want to go just how I got here, the 2011 gsl blizzcon finals I remember watching wishing I was there, 2012 MLG Anaheim was my first tournament going to live and the experience was more than I could ever hope for.

As for blizzcon I wanna go To be with people who share a even longer love of what I've lived my life with more than e-sports everyone who plays a blizzard title has some love for the company, even if they don't always get it right or we complain about the balance of games everyone Still knows blizzard at its heart is about making good games and they do a damn good job at it.",I love this game and I love Blizzard.,27,M,starcraft
"Hey man, you just don't understand how easy you got it.  I'm living with a mirror image of your ex.  For the first year, things went really well.  I thought I had finally found the right one and was very happy.  Year 2, the crazy started peeking out.  I thought it was strange at first, very unlike her.  She would get mad at me for stupid things...meaningless things, and stay mad for  days . 
 I'm not perfect, but I'm loving, caring, I provide, I'm patient, and generally try to be the best person in all areas of life, especially to my significant other.  None of that seemed to matter though, as she would initiate fights constantly over dumb stuff.  It got worse, and so I broke it off...but it wasn't a serious break.  I loved her, and didn't want to be without her.  I explained to her that every time she acted like that, it hurt me, and that it was going to stop either by her stopping, or us not being together.  A few months later, we broke up again (same reason).  Things had been better for a bit, but it started back up with a vengeance.  We were living about an hour apart from each other at this time, and she said the main thing was the distance between us (even though I stayed with her over weekends). 
 So last year I had her move into my house with her 2 kids.  I thought things would quiet down, but again, I was wrong.  I showed her my commitment to her by proposing (something I have not done but once before in my 37 years), but that didn't help.  She constantly did things to really ratchet up my blood pressure to point where I could barely do my job.  I'm a laid back sort of person...worry about the important stuff and the stuff you can control, otherwise be happy with what you have.  She was making it so bad that my dentist didn't want to work on me once because my blood pressure was at very high levels (another bad morning with her). 
 We broke up again for a short time, and she promised she would change.  She promised she would make an effort, and I gave in because I loved her.  We went to see a relationship counselor. 
 During this time, her car got repo'ed (early Dec '12).  Here I was, ready to save the day.  Even though we had looked at a budget and she was supposed to have been paying her note, she hadn't been so my reasoning was simple.  She needed a reliable, safe, and cheap car.  I find an '07 Mazda 5 that I could put 0 down on, and pay $200 a month on (completely out of my pocket because she was broke).  She's livid.  Her reasoning was ""how would it look if I dropped off the kids to my ex-husband in that?""  That was the key moment when I realized: I was a fool. 
 We were to have another meeting with the relationship counselor and I had made up my mind that I was going to break up for good while there, and finish all of this.  The counselor had turned out to be pretty anti-male in our sessions, but my main hope had been that she would spot whatever mental issues were going on in her (my ex).  Anywho, to my surprise, after talking to us about recent events, the counselor said ""Some people just shouldn't be together.  Relationships shouldn't take this much effort and I'm seeing a lot of red flags."" 
 I was floored.  She essentially broke us up for me.  In the meantime, I waited.  I waited for Christmas to pass so the kids wouldn't have that ruined.  I waited for her to get her CDL so she could get a new job.  I waited for her to get her tax refund, so she'd have a strong base for her new place (I didn't make her pay rent or any utilities).  Now I'm pushing her to find a new place to live, and am having to put more and more pressure into it.  She thought we would end up getting back together, but after these last few months, she finally realizes this is permanent. 
 We still sleep in the same bed, but I absolutely cannot show any form of closeness to her because she takes it as entrance back into a relationship with me, therefore I don't let her touch me.  During our last argument, I did have to bring up eviction, but I really don't want to do that...I just hope it doesn't come to it.  Needless to say, I've been living a nightmare for the last 7 or 8 months, and I hope that it doesn't change me permanently.","It's a lovely story about a man who's life is just peachy.

"I was dating this girl for over 4 years (since my sophomore year of high school and her 8th grade year), I am now 20 and she is 18. I wanted nothing more than to marry her, get a house together, kids, the whole happily ever after. So about 6 months ago I received a partial nude photo from another girl. I was not asking for a nude. She was saying that she felt uncomfortable about herself, so I asked for a picture (just picture) and I would be completely honest with her. After she sent that, I told her she should not be uncomfortable, then deleted the photo and kept the whole thing to myself. The girl who sent the picture later becomes a friend of my girlfriend and feels guilty about it long after I rid my memory of the whole incident. My girlfriend gets told the story, but from the other girl's POV. My girlfriend and I have a long, surprisingly calm discussion which ends in a break up. Neither of us really wanted this at the time, but thought it might be a good thing. She now is wanting to date others already (I think as a rebound [it's happened before]). Needless to say, I absolutely regret the break up already when it just happened 8/28. I am willing to do absolutely anything to get her back.

His legs came off and his torso (twisted like a wet towel caught in the dryer door) was pinned and dragged with the stopping train wheel.

"I have bipolar. I had experienced deep depression and bouts of hypomania (a mild form of mania) but had never experienced full-blown mania. That is until I was 26. After a couple of nights of little sleep when my team was working on the most important project in the company with a looming deadline, mania took over. 
 At work I am mild-mannered. Although I voice my opinions, I do so with less certainty than most. The first signs of mania were when I confidently- if not aggressively-gave my recommendations without qualification. People seemed to listen more than usual, and I didn't feel any anxiety. It was intoxicating, so I kept going. When I got faint praise from more senior people in the company, I took it as some sort of omen that I was moving ahead. When people were taking a break, I wanted to be the ring leader. I laughed hysterically and pushed boundaries. Everything was great. 
 When we finished working after 11 that first night of mania, I was still wired. I didn't even bother trying to sleep. I figured I might as well go out drinking. After all, things were going so well that I should celebrate. I went out by myself, chatting up random people at the bar. I got completely wasted. Upon leaving the bar, I encountered a homeless man who was selling roses. I gave him all the money in my wallet and offered to take him out for a drink. I got at most four hours of sleep that night and faced another long day at work. 
 I woke up feeling pretty good, considering that I had worked all day and been up most of the night drinking. My thinking was less clear than it was the day before, but I still felt brilliant at times. Mostly I was just giddy and disrespectful. When I was becoming disruptive of work, I was encouraged to take a nap. At this point, I couldn't sleep and became delusional and paranoid. Amped up on caffeine, I tried to get through the remainder of the day. I mostly just freaked people out as I became psychotic and weirdly sexual. If I didn't freak them out, I simply insulted them. One of the people I outright insulted was the head of our department and one of the most senior people in the company. Of course I thought it was all in good fun. 
 After I insulted him, he took me to the side and tried to figure out what was going on. I was sent home and told I had to see a doctor. I saw a doctor in house that night, who prescribed some sleeping pills for the night. All the while, I thought everything was going great. 
 A car service took me to my girlfriend's, where it dawned on me that I was fucking losing it. I took the sleeping pills but couldn't sleep. I was, however, able to write a rambling, paranoid email to a VP in the company in the middle of the night, which was mercifully replied to with kindness the next morning. 
 My girlfriend called my parents, and they arranged for me to go to the psychiatric ward of a local hospital. I was there for a week and then returned to work. 
 People walked on eggshells around me at first, but that eventually changed.  Everyone accepts the explanation that it was insomnia and has moved on. I've gotten acknowledgements within the organization and still work on important projects. It took the most time for me to accept myself and what happened. Even though I'm at peace with it, I find thinking about everything I did at the peak to be too cringe-inducing to think about.","Got first manic episode at work, was sent home, went to the psych ward for a week and still don't like thinking about it.

"I'm 27 and married to a wonderful man, but I'm feeling a lot of emptiness in my life due to not having any friends. In the last few years we moved to a new city and we met a few people through his job which we hung out with on and off. They have mostly moved away now. I was relatively comfortable with these people, but it took a very long time to get to that point during which I was very awkward. 
 I'm in therapy and my therapist stresses that I am an interesting person with a lot to offer as a friend and I just have to put myself out there. I accept this and it's evidenced by my interactions with my husband's friends -- I'm a kind and generous person and I have passions and interests that I can share with others. It took a long time to accept that I even  can  be a good friend, I was dealing with very terrible self esteem issues at the beginning of therapy which are probably 70% better, especially since therapy has helped me lose a significant amount of weight(around 50lbs, I'm now a ""normal"" weight). 
 I've noticed with my weight loss that other women approach me more in a friendly way when I'm out shopping or doing groceries or whatever, and I have no idea how to continue that interaction. It feels like due to my weight and demeanor I was essentially invisible from ages 18 to 27, and now that I am not I feel startled/alarmed when people talk to me because it is so unusual. As an example, last week I was at Target and one of the people there tried to strike up a conversation with me, asking how my day was going and talking about their day. I almost had a full blown panic attack, I just awkwardly continued the interaction for a few seconds and walked away. My heart was racing. It is like I get a  huge  adrenaline rush from people talking to me because it pretty much has not happened very much in the last like 10 years. I also feel like people think I'm a bitch for being short with them. 
 Even when I'm placed in situations where I know people want to be around me(example: husband's friend's girlfriend wants to hang out with me and sets it up through her SO and my husband), I don't know how to have a conversation without being weird, quiet, etc. It hurts that I don't know what to say or do. There have been a couple of occasions like this. It's particularly difficult when other women try to talk to me about their problems. I want so badly to relate and engage with them, but it's like there is a break between my brain and my ability to talk. If I think of things to say that are probably normal/good, I doubt myself and don't say them, and then I will often say something that I later think was not appropriate or weird. I feel like I totally blew it in one of these situations with a girl I had a lot in common with just by being weird. I just feel so uncomfortable with new people. 
 Right now I'm feeling guilty because my husband got me a groupon for a fitness class that is mostly women, and I have been too scared to go. I've been wanting to try this particular class for a long time, and I'm just paralyzed by my fear of conversation, even though I desperately want to be able to make friends with women who share my interests. I even have things in common with my sisters-in-law, but I can't even make a connection with them. 
 Pretty much I have always been this way but it never was a big deal because in school you are thrown together with people, if you're weird and socially awkward you just kind of hang on to each other and are friends by default. It was only into my 20s when I lost touch with my school friends that it became an issue. How can I start fixing this? How can I steer my therapist toward helping with this? I've come so far with my self esteem and depression, and I just feel like there is a huge mountain to climb to take that next step of actually being able to have friends and a fulfilling life.","I don't understand how to make friends, and I act weird when people express interest in me as a friend.

"Hi everyone. This is my first time posting but I could really use some advice. 
 My (25f) SO (25m) have been together for 2.5 years and Haven recently been discussing our future. I've picked out a ring, we've agreed on a timeline and we're so excited to get engaged then married and spend the rest of our lives together. 
 We talk about everything. We've talked about money, jobs, travel, buying a house, etc. 
 We've also talked about children.  Both of us are in a position right now where we know we're not ready for children. We still want to travel and work and be together. However, any time we talk about whether we see ourselves with children in the long term we come up blank. 
 I honestly have no strong feelings either way when it comes to children. I've babysat a bunch and i enjoy being around children but they can also annoy the crap out of me. I also cannot imagine being a mother in the sense that I'd have no idea how to care for a child. 
 Our parents keep jokingly asking about grandchildren and its got me thinking more about it I want them.

"I'm a 21-year-old male. My girlfriend is 19. We have been together for 9 months. We have a fantastic sex life and great communication. 
 Having said that, there is always room for improvement, and one of the areas that I would like to work on is how my girlfriend gives me oral sex. Ever since we have been together, I have never been able to cum just from oral sex, which I've always thought was weird, because I really enjoy it. The other day I saw a post on here asking what the most important thing women can do to give a great blowjob is, and the overwhelming response from guys was to be enthusiastic about it. It needs to be obvious to a guy that a woman enjoys pleasuring him. 
 I realized that this is what is missing with my girlfriend. When we began our relationship she was very reluctant about oral sex. I gave it a little time and she decided to start doing it. Now she does it, but still with a little reluctance. There are times she initiates, but most of the time I have to specifically ask her to do it. She loves me very much and wants to please me, so she has never turned me down, but it is obvious she would rather be doing other things. This prevents me from being able to relax and enjoy it fully, because if she's not having fun I can't either. 
 I've seen the importance of enthusiasm from the way I approach cunnilingus. I love to go down on her, and I do it every chance I get. I tell her how much I love it, how much I love her smell, her taste, and how hot it gets me. I'm constantly trying to learn new techniques and more about her response to try and please her better. And she loves it. She has told me many times that the hottest thing for her about our sex life is how much I love to please her and how enthusiastic I am about it. I just want this same experience with her when she does oral sex. 
 How can I approach her about this in a constructive way without hurting her feelings or making her feel inadequate?",I can't fully enjoy oral sex from my girlfriend and I've realized it is because she is not enthusiastic about it.

"I finally decided to go out running today. I have a few basic questions (not sure if I should ask in /r/running instead). 
 First of all, is there any validity in this  image  ? I see that it is very similar to the Couch to 5k that is posted in the faq. 
 I'm a smoker (around a pack/week), haven't done any kind of physical activity in 3 or 4 years. I walk daily around 1km between bus stops and work, if that counts for anything. 21 year old male, btw. 
 I only lasted 10 out of 20 minutes did exactly 4 ""rounds"" out of 8. Partly because my social anxiety kicked in, mostly because I was exhausted already.... and coincidentally I reached my house door at the exact 1m 30s of walking for the 4th time (or maybe I subconsciously calculated the time). 
 I need some running shoes I guess, since I could literally feel the impact on my heels, and I'm pretty sure this is not good in the long term. My second question is, how would I know if I'm doing it right? 
 Third question. Are my legs supposed to feel sore? Because they don't. Just a bit in my lower legs, the front particularly. 
 I decided to run because I need to deal with depression somehow, and this seems like the easiest thing to try. If I can commit to this, maybe later think about joining a gym. I'm just looking for a way to feel more active, and maybe a bit better about myself. Get some will to do something other than going to work and coming home everyday. And to distract myself from any catastrophic plan. 
 I am, and I've always been a fairly short and skinny guy, so I'm also wondering if doing cardio will actually make me look less healthy.... as I said, I don't really feel like I could join a gym to lift weights right now.","This [picture] was posted the other day. Is it valid?

"ive been very depressed as of late, my moving situation has made it harder to exercise and now i had just started going to my schools gym. i quit my job in january thinking id be happier away from the stress the job emitted. but all thats happened is ive gotten worse anxiety thinking about my future and im comstantly depreciating my value. i always fantasize about finding a girl and being their best friend and envisioning the life id like to have. i then try to translate all those dreams to reality and all i can muster is that im a 25 year old, jobless, degreeless (atm) individual with no peculiar skill sets, or supportive group of friends, who lives with his parents that arent even supportive. 
 I can only temporarily convince myself im worth anyone elses time, but not for long enough to actually approach someone, talk to them, and formulate some kind of friendship. 
 nothing feels natural and all the self improvement progress i make falls short of my impatience and ends up feeling more like work than actual progress.. i dont know how to escape this mindset, even after trying positive reinforcement for my actions, and doing things like categorizing my good qualities and focusing on them. all i end up doing is playing guitar long enough to distract me from how lonely i actually am. 
 ive never had long lasting friendships, throughout my life either id move or they would. its become so habitual to meet someone cool, then have them move and forget about me, that i've subconsciously eliminated the possibility of making friends or relating to people that i end up just talking to people about whatever they happen to be talking to me about. 
 i dont know how to express myself as being interesting because i always feel like im doing particularly less with my time than everyone else (people whom i know and dont know). 
 its me, its all me, i do realize this. there are some good days where i actually believe i can be who i want, and others where i feel doomed and tell myself i need to die to stop burdening my parents with being responsible for my shelter, and to save every girl i would ever like the hassle of having to go through an interaction with me that will most likely end up replaying itself in the back of my mind over and over again because i practically live in regret of all my decisions due to a flaw in myself where i go for the things i think i can achieve as opposed to going for the ones i want, whom im not so sure about being able to achiever (low self esteem/confidence)",im in the pits!,25,M,depression
"I've been doing this for a year, and my life is nowhere the same. 
 Just to put into context last year, I was: 
 *25 years old 
 *Still living with my parents 
 *No interest in women or relationships (I had porn) 
 *2 years since my last  sexual encounter (that includes kissing) 
 
 Working a dead-end sales job, making a little more than a fast food employee, but much more stress 
 
 Porn-Induced ED (I couldn't get it up at all, women actually asked if I was gay while we were making out, I used to blame them because they were not ""hot enough"" like the porno chicks) 
 
 
 *No real direction 
 Phase 1: NoFap 
 This got the ball rolling.  But I realized this is the first step.  This step alone got me laid.  However, I broke the heart of the girl I was sleeping with, because I had no feelings, all I cared about was sex.  I want to apologize to her, make it up, but there's nothing I can do.   It turns you into a sex starved animal, and unless you control it; can lead to intense destruction and bad decisions.  The concept of NoFap is kind of like pulling back an arrow and preparing to shoot it; of course replace arrow with sex energy. 
 Phase 2: Kegels 
 I slept with 3 women, with NoFap, and I wanted these women, I could naturally attract them, but my bedroom skills sucked.  I could get it up, but only like once a week; and that's because I wouldn't FAP for a week, then after that, I wouldn't have any endurance. So I would be like 30 seconds every two weeks. 
 I hate to sound like a conceited idiot.  But I have to say it. 
 After kegels; I'm excellent in bed.  I'm am able to literally stop my orgasms using my PC muscles; and am able to extend my sessions between orgasms by working my BC muscles.  Essentially, my girlfriend is satisfied.  I'm not SUPER WELL-ENDOWED.  I used to think I was small, but after kegels, I have these 100% rock-hard erections; the same erections you get when you are just about to cum, I get all the time.  I don't know why anybody would ever use Viagra when kegels exist.  Just read the case studies. These things work. 
 Phase 3: Reading & Audiobooks 
 I listen to audiobooks now.  I used to listen to Lil Wayne, Eminem, listen to head-banger rock music, but now I just reserve that purely for workouts 
 This was the phase that jolted my self-improvement.  Some books that I've read:
 Think and Grow Rich - Napoleon Hill Outwitting the Devil - Napoleon Hill
 Listening to Mixergy.Com Interviews Psycho-Cybernetics - Dr. Maxwell Maltz
*How to Win Friends and Influence People - Dale Carnegie 
 
 The Power of Habit - Charles Duhigg 
 The Slight Edge - Jeff Olson 
 The Greatest Salesman in the World - Og Mandino 
 
 Keep in mind, I don't read these books once. I read them over and over again, and I plan on doing this for the rest of my life. 
 Read Napoleon Hill's thoughts on sexual transmutation.  If you truly grasp and understand why sex transmutation is important; combined with the TED talks from Gary Wilson. You'll immediately get pissed at pornography, that you've wasted your time and your human potential jacking off to pixels. 
 I go on GoneWild sometimes, just to test myself (I don't recommend this, especially if you're beginning).  I find the women on there extremely attractive still.  I am a man after all.  Naked women never get old.  But I don't want to Fap to them.  That's just freaking stupid to me.  So after my mind absorbs all this negative energy of porn, I just filter it out and take even more action bettering myself than before. 
 Phase 4: Meditation 
 Meditation is a tough one.  Because it's hard to know how to meditate.  There are so many different styles, different approaches, it's tough to find one. 
 So I just do the following, I've created my own rubric for success: 
 1: I meditate for 30 minutes, visualizing me being successful and vividly imagine me executing my plan for success; successfully, I imagine every detail including the sights, sounds, smells, temperature, emotions. etc. Read Psycho-Cybernetic by Dr. Maxwell Maltz.  Prepare to have your life changed. 
 2: I meditate for 30 minutes to concentrate on purely nothing, just to concentrate on inner peace, to calm my mental chatter. 
 This allows me to see the world in truth, and not just my opinion of the world, because meditation of inner peace causes you to separate your ego, your emotions from all important facts and decisions, and allows you to make the best decision for the specific situation without ego. 
 Keep in mind, these are just my phases, you can do all these phases today.  But here are the results of these: 
 I have found the woman of my dreams (making all my female co workers jealous and talk crap about me behind my back haha) We have incredible sex, and usual she's the one to tap out 
 
 Moved out of my parents apartment
*Quit my dead-end job, and started my own business 
 Attracting more women now than ever (but I'm not interested at all, which is funny to me, because when I was, most women didn't give me any time.)","NoFap is awesome, it gets the ball rolling.  Combine it with other efforts, and you'll master life.",25,M,NoFap
"The scene took place in a caravan when I was 16, me and a girlfriend of about 2 months at that point had already planned it out to occur, but rather underestimated the size of the caravan. 
 There were 4 single beds and a double bed. There were 8 people on the trip. Take a moment to acknowledge the logistics and approximate size of the very small caravan here. -- Okay, great. 
 So there was me and my best bud in 2 singles with each of our girlfriends in the other 2 singles. Next to the girls room was  my girlfriend's parents  in the double bed. The other two who weren't a couple were crashing in the only remaining caravan room besides the bathroom. 
 One night I swap with my bud's girlfriend so I get to be in the girls room and she in my room with her boyfriend. Finally I get my chance. 
 Foreplay ensues, I pull out a durex and we both look at it with confusion  (it was her first time too) . ""How the fuck does this work?"" I say, because for some fucked up reason nobody ever taught me how to put one on properly. 
 She fiddles with it because girls in fact do get taught how to deal with these rubbery motherfuckers, and sticks it on me. It doesn't fit. Not trying to brag on the internet but clearly something has gone either very wrong, like it's on inside out  (it wasn't)  else I'm going to be in for a lot of hurt. 
 Don't care - waited too long - this is happening. 
 It's gone midnight at this point and I'm rallying up solid snake in his rubber noose for the initial assault.

 Blood. Everywhere. 
 I have no idea if she was on her period or not, but I see the blood and by this point my trouser cannon is deflating like a pierced modelling balloon due to the suffocation by rubber, and after some very half-arsed thrusts for about 5 minutes the most of which consisted of us both laughing because of how dreadful everything was going,  her parents walk in on me  balls deep in their daughter. 
 Turns out the entire caravan had heard our antics, our awkward conversations, laughing and the overall failure of the entire operation. Her mother gives me the most punishing &#3232;_&#3232; face and ordered me and my bud's girlfriend to swap rooms by the count of 3. 
 I grabbed what little clothes I had and ran back to my room extremely blooded and defeated, passing the other girlfriend in the process. I jumped into my bed and sat straight faced staring at my buddy. He sat straightfaced back at me.

"This year is the year i'm finally getting my shit together. 
 A little about me: 
I'm turning 20 in a month, and I live in a really rough town in Southern California. I come from a low income family that made it work for 3 kids. Im the youngest, and that means i got stuck at home, caring for a sick mother. She's dieing from the same disease I have, Muscular Dystrophy. 
 For the last few years i've been, for lack of a better phrase, pathetically useless. I've done nothing, i had no drive, i barely had friends, and i would just sit on the computer and do absolutely nothing. This lifestyle started to irritate me in the middle of last year, because everyone i know is now in the military. I can't be in the military because of the disease. I didn't know what to do. Then suddenly out of freaking nowhere, i got a job. I ended up, ironically, training the Military. Im a military role player for conflict scenarios involving middle eastern civilians. A cooler job then it sounds like, all those years of Role Playing in MMO's paid off. 
 After i got the job i got a spike in motivation. I started to consider my life, my future, and the difference cash could actually make. Im still fairly poor and this job pays incredibly. Now, i Have made plans to go to college to become a Highschool English Teacher, eventually pursuing a career as a college professor. 
 Last year, on top of my moms health declining, it turns out my dad has dangerously high cholesterol, and i have an ulcer and a hiadel hernia. My dad and I eat like  shit . Were very very unhealthy, and i have stomach problems as a result of eating like a 50 year old man. So it hit me.. as of that moment. 
 EVERY DAY  i will work out. Im starting slow with things like sit-ups after everytime i accomplish something remedial. I do a sit up for every kill, and a push up for every death in online games like Halo and LoL. Ill do the same type of regiment whenever i get urges, or sit here doing absolutely nothing on reddit. Ill be making sure that i spend less time doing nothing and more time concentrating on fitness. 
 FROM NOW ON  we're (my dad and I) removing fast food from my diet completely. I know this might not sound like much, but this may be the hardest part of this journey. We eat like barbarians, and we spend a lot on burritos and pizza and in n out. This is an absolute requirement, and we're going to do it from now on, no exceptions. Ive been given the chance to be healthy 30 years before my father chose to. The chance to be alive, fighting a horrible disease, im going to respect my body. 
 REMOVING GREASE  from my everyday home diet. I make a lot of ground beef, bacon, sausage, or hamburger based recipes for dinner, maybe 3 times a week, every week. I dont even know what certain vegetables taste like. Today i had my first fresh Tomato, and it was fantastic with Tuna Fish. Im also going to eat fish, ive never eaten fish in my life. Thats really exciting. 
 I WENT SWING DANCING  off of a fluke, and i met amazing new people, and made amazing new friends. I have very few friends, and i dont know how to meet people very well. Now, im making efforts to meet people everytime i go to social places, and i feel happier and happier every morning. Im going to continue this from now on. I just feel better about myself, and im enjoying life for the first time since my diagnosis at 8 years old.

"Hello, engineers! 
 I have known that I want to work in the space industry for a very long time, and seeing everything Elon Musk and his fellows have accomplished has only made that conviction stronger.  I hold a Bachelor's (2012) and a nonthesis Master's (2013) in Mechanical Engineering.  Upon graduating last spring, however, I failed completely and utterly at finding work outside oil and gas.  As a result, until recently my plan was to build work experience and contacts until I could eventually convince someone in the space industry to hire me. 
 I spent a year and a half as the only mechanical engineer for a general contracting company (I left for a few reasons, but their refusal to hire another engineer to support an engineer in his first job is chief among them), and I recently started a job designing structural pipe systems and modifying existing systems to suit customers' applications.  However, considering how many structural engineers there are that probably want to get into the space business, I am not sure that this is the best long-term plan to get where I want to go. 
 If I return to grad school, I would pursue a thesis Master's in Aerospace Engineering (my college did not offer any degrees in the discipline), and since the deadlines for application to Fall 2015 term mostly fall from late October to December, I would likely apply for the Spring or Fall 2016 terms.  I would very much like to work part-time for either a professor or a connected company, but I worry that this could spread my time too thin, since I have very little research experience on which to base a judgment.

"FINAL EDIT:  I'm putting this one at the top to save all new readers some confusion: I'm a girl. Read this in a girls voice. Nobody realized I was female until they got to my first edit. 
 So my dad and I are both stoners. We're also both aware of our recreational drug use, however my dad doesn't do it around me, and refuses to partake in the activity with me. Fair enough. 
 My dad also has asthma, so he recently told me that he now consumes his weed through edibles. I've found his weed in his freezer in the past when he did smoke it, and would often break off a little bit for myself. He's never called me out on it, so I've never gotten caught (not that I'd admit to it if he did). Not to mention that, being a stoner, he can be a bit of a space cadet. 
 So yesterday, I'm at his house and he's in the other room on the phone, with his friend. I overhear him raving about these new weed brownies he got from a friend when he went to BC. Being the sneaky little bandit I am, I waited for him to take the dog out, and immediately went to the freezer to steal myself some of these infamous pot brownies. 
 When I open the freezer, sure enough I see a little ziplock bag with 4 brownies in it. I take one and figure my dad wouldn't notice it was missing. Dearest daddy returns, we hang out for a bit longer, and then I leave. I live about 20 minutes away from my dad, so as soon as I get to my car I devour the brownie, hoping it will start to come into effect by the time I get home. 
 The drive home is uneventful, but after about 30 minutes of being home my stomach starts to grumble in an intense way that signaled to me that I needed to get to a toilet. Immediately. I run to the washroom and hot, liquidy, lava-poop starts flowing from my asshole. I'm on the toilet for 20 minutes, completely amazed and disgusted that I had 20 minutes worth of poop in my body, when I get a text from my dad. It's a picture of him holding the ziplock bagged brownies over a garbage can, giving the camera a cheshire cat smile, and a thumbs up. The message with the picture read: ""Can't believe you fell for it. Enjoy the laxatives. Don't steal from your father!"" 
 So for the last 24 hours I've had to dash to the washroom almost every 10-15 minutes. I'm sitting on the toilet as I type this, and I can't leave the house for very long. The only time I have was to get Gatorade so I didn't shit all the water/electrolytes in my body out. My dad told me he set it all up, the phone call, the brownies, so he could catch me in the act. Lesson learned, father. Lesson learned.","Thought I stole weed brownies from my dad. Turns out it was all a set up and ended up eating laxative brownies, and I'm still shitting. Moral of the story: don't try to steal drugs from your parents. 
 EDIT:  Some people are giving me a hard time, because he's my father, and that ""stealing is wrong."" Just wanted to point out that yes, I am well aware that stealing is wrong. I'm not some kleptomaniac, people. I stole some weed from my dad when he's got a shitload to spare. Also, if you haven't taken it from the story, my dad is cool as fuck. I don't think he cared about the weed as much as he did about the opportunity to prank his daughter. And like I said many times: lesson fucking learned! Rest assured everyone who is mad at me about stealing from my dad, I will NOT try to take his edibles ever again. Myself and my butthole are far too traumatized. I swear the poor thing has PTSD (post traumatic shit disorder).

"Hello everyone! (sorry for the wall of text) 
 So simply put: I'm  25 year old crossdresser who lives at home with his family. Unfortunately for me, I have very little privacy in this home, so for a long time I have not been able to buy my own clothes and hide them. Despite the lack of privacy, I am home alone often enough. 
 Very recently I found an area in my closet where I can successfully hide some things, so I'm on the brink of purchasing my very first items! Nothing fancy really, just a pair of stockings and a chemise. 
 I've been in the closet all my life, since I started back when I was like, 13, and the only clothes I had access to were my mom's and sister's and even then I had very little to choose from. Both are plain women, and I wanted to wear stockings, high heels, short skirts, and mini-dresses! 
 I was hoping by now I would be working full-time, making plenty of money to where I can have an apartment all to myself and buy all the clothes I want, but things haven't gone according to plan. 
 To be frank, I've grown tired of my hobby existing only in my mind and in my stories (my only income at the moment is from erotica), and yesterday I found a simple outfit that only costs like $30 online and would be very easy to hide, but I chickened out at the last moment. 
 The site says that they ship in discrete boxes, but my problem is that I'm super paranoid about getting caught and finally having my own lingerie—as thrilling and exciting as it sounds—is also really scary. 
 I don't know how much longer I can hold out and for the time being, I have no viable job aspects that can whisk me away from all this and end my crossdressing drought. 
 So please, any advice would be appreciative! and thank you in advance!","live at home, want to buy some lingerie, scared to.

"Im 23 years old, and I live in a small town outside of Evansville, IN. I was swimming at my friends lake over the weekend. We have been friends for our entire lives. He brought all his fireworks to the lake and we were acting dumb and lighting shit on fire. He ended up burning himself on his arm pretty bad. So, we decided to take the 4-wheeler back to his house so he can get fixed up. 
 That’s when we met the girl. She was very pretty and walking down the road. I think she thought it was weird that we were both naked on the 4-wheeler, and I thought so too. But we had to talk to her! She was really nice at first, but I think we kind of pushed her away... My friend was so stupid and showed her the burn on his arm. I said she looked nice, and invited her to a movie sometime... She said yes! But... later that day I saw her walking with some friends near the lake we were swimming at. As I drove by her, she pointed at me and laughed... So it almost seems like she was making fun of me.. Should I even bother trying to pursue her?",I met a girl who seemed nice and accepted a date with me. But later that day I think I saw her laughing at me with her friends.,23,M,relationships
"1) It can be a good sign that you have female friends. If other potential women see you around attractive women, they automatically see you as more attractive (those attractive women that hang out with you can't be wrong, right?). 
 However, to the concern that they find you nonthreatening or because you are Sikh or because you are safe, is perfectly valid. I seen many girls talk about guys who are too nice who they can call up to walk them home and be certain that they will do nothing to escalate. One girl even called on of them ""functionally gay"". 
 To avert this, you need to have the mind-set that you can't always be just nice to the single girls that hang around with you. Nice doesn't tingle their emotion, being unforgivingly bold (and to a point, an asshole, but a ""nice"" asshole). This means not doing favors for them just because they are girls. This also means assuming attraction with every girl you see as attractive and escalating (at least verbally) at every chance you have. This means flirting. If you don't flirt, they will assume your just another nice guy and you'll be off of their radar. 
 In term of your allegedly lackluster appearances and perhaps the fact that you are a Sikh diminishing your confidence is understandable. I'm 18 and I am currently an ex-Sikh, but I have lived having the wear a turban during my school years and having the feeling that it lowers my confidence. You have to remember that the confidence that effectively wins a girl is one that is not situational nor external (appearances). This unwavering confidence is the fact that you are yourself and that you don't give a shit what others think about you. That is pure confidence. Just learn to assume attraction and flirt, don't be the ""nice guy"" and practice having true confidence will eventually fix your issue. 
 2) If there is a girl in class you want to ask out, you should have asked her out yesterday. That would have been the best option. The second best option would be the next time you see her in class. The more you wait, the more you hesitate. Waiting till the end of the semester is the worse possible time. Talk to her, escalate verbally a bit, and then ask her out (don't forget to get her number too). Then chat up later and tell her you'll see her at the zoo/park/date location. 
 3) The reason girls your age don't like you is the fact that you are being the ""nice guy"". Girls in the 20s will definitely hook up with assholes all around. They will claim that you ""nice guys"" are too nice and special to be in the same group as the assholes they sleep with, so they will only be with you when they stop having so many hookups and start settling down and trying to have a long term relationship (those women in the 20s-30s). And that is a bad sign, if you didn't figure out already. You may qualify as ""husband"" material and nothing more, which is what you want to avoid. That means girls will wait out on sex, want you to buy them things, not try hard in the relationship (knowing you will not leave them because you are a nice guy). Being the ""asshole"" (by now, you know it does not mean being an actual asshole, just confident, bold and not a nice guy) is the equivalent of being cool, interesting, and sexually desired. The girl with the asshole will know there are girls lining up to be with him, so the girl will put in more of an effort in the relationship. In the short term, it means that those girls in the 20s (your age) will start to find you attractive. 
 Lastly, on the fact that it will be odd if she shuts you down, laugh it off. Show that you don't care if she says yes or no. If you do this, she will tell her friends how confident you were, and not how weird it was. Take that and apply it to all your interactions (be outcome independent).","Stop being the ""nice guy"" and become the ""asshole"". Ask out the girl out ASAP. Girls your age don't like you because your the nice guy (So women in their 30s and 40s like your because you're husband material. BAD)! 
 I know being Sikh is a huge challenge to put on when faced in the realm of seduction (I know I couldn't be as successful as you if I continued practicing), so I wish you good luck.",18,M,seduction

I flew home for the weekend to see my friends and family (also for my birthday) and she went to a neighbor university for a regional meeting for a club she's in. The last time we were apart, she expressed to me that she didn't feel like I texted her enough while we were apart, so I have made a greater effort to text her this weekend.

"I've been in a long term poly relationship for several years now and I live with my partner. Our relationship is strong and for the most part, pretty drama free these days. It wasn't always so and because of that many of the other relationships I tried to start during that time, didn't stand a chance. Now, they do. I'm actively dating and hopefully forming strong additional relationships. I don't know what my final ""want"" looks like precisely, (I'm open to things taking shape in the way that feels natural as they form) but I do know that I believe I can have a long term, secure relationship with someone else in addition to the relationship I'm already in. I want that. I want love and security in abundance. 
 I recently started seeing someone who is out of a long term marriage/relationship which he ended because he wanted kids and she did not. We get along SO very well, enjoy each other's company and the intimacy is amazing. I'm not in love with him yet but I definitely see how I could eventually be. The problem comes with the fact that he, in his 40s, is absolutely looking for someone to start a family with. I am 37 years old and although I am not against having children, I recognize that the window is closing for me and it has never been a ""goal"" in my life. I've always adopted the attitude that ""if it happens, it happens, if it doesn't, it doesn't and I'm good either way."" Part of why poly is so appealing to me also relates to this as I would be more comfortable raising a child within a strong multi-relationship environment than I would with just one other person. However, I also recognize that forming strong long term relationships take an incredible amount of time and work. I feel that this person is more determined to find someone who is eager to have babies than he is to put the time in to see what the possibilities are with the people he's forming relationships with. (i.e. me and one other woman that he's seeing.) Because of this, he's going out on a lot of dates, trying to find what I expect he sees as ""the ultimate"" solution. In the meantime, I feel like a placeholder and I'm apprehensive about continuing to form a relationship with him. I don't want my heart to hurt. 
 I get it. I get we all have different wants and long term goals and ways of going about getting where we want to be. Especially at this age. I respect that he knows what he wants. He respects that I feel differently about that want. 
 Do I stay in this and see what it can become or do I back out and count my losses now before my heart gets involved too deep?",new partner who is determined to start a family with children and I'm just looking for a new partner to be a long term part of my life without any real expectations.,37,F,polyamory
"I'm a 23/f that just was diagnosed with Trigeminal Neuralgia. Basically, it's extreme pain in the face and whole left side of my head. To make this short, I have good days and bad days. Every day I feel it, but some not as heavy as others. For example, my bad days mean an excruciating icepick headache that seeps pain into my face every 10 minutes, for 20 seconds. Good days mean not any real pain, just slight annoying twinges once or twice a day. 
 My family refers to them as headaches, which is really frustrating to me. They aren't headaches. I can't even really explain this. I'm in-between jobs right now so it's going to be really difficult for me and I need some support. I don't mean full financial support, but just understanding that I do have a rough time. I will need help here and there. I don't spend tons of money but some help would be really appreciated until I get this under control. If I can. 
 I'm also afraid I'm going to affect my relationships. The guy I'm interested in being with might not really comprehend this fully. I don't want him to have to support me. I don't know what to do or even say about it. I won't be able to go out all the time. Sometimes I will literally have to stay in bed and watch Netflix. I can't even begin to think how to approach this subject. I'm afraid he will just leave and find a ""normal"" girlfriend.

"Did not happen today, but a couple of weeks ago. 
 My wife and I have just had our third wonderful child. Not wanting a fourth, we agree I should get a vasectomy. No big deal: just a little snip and removes all the worries with contraception. 
 My doctor didn't seem to understand why I wanted it, but I quickly dismissed him, insisting I had thought hard about what I wanted and was not going to change my mind. Same with the consultant. I sign the papers and the operation is booked. 
 A few weeks later, after I wake up from the operation, everything feels fine but numb. Consultant gives me some strong warnings about being careful with my penis over the next fortnight, but I don't take it too seriously. 
 After my wife has driven me home, we take off my trousers to take a look at the scrotum scar. The head of my penis is wrapped in a soft bandage. She removes it and screams. I look down. It is covered in blood and we can't find my foreskin. Scrotum seems normal. 
 After we calm down, wife fetches my papers. Turns out I had booked myself in for a circumcision, not a vasectomy. Not their fault: my wife remembered me getting the words confused a few times over the past weeks as well. 
 Recovery was unpleasant. For a week, woke up every few hours in the middle of the night, somewhere between screaming and crying because the stitches were being stretched. Could not walk properly. Penis looks like someone else's. Two weeks after the operation, I am only just getting anywhere near back to normal. My boss is not impressed either.

"I've [24f]been in recovery for 21 months,  so I shouldn't be this stupid. 
 I have a boyfriend, ""James""[26m]. We've been dating for 11 months.   We are in an open relationship.  James is not an alcoholic.  He drinks normally sometimes. 
 My (ex) side guy, ""Rob"" [29M] was an active alcoholic and user.  We've been talking on and off for nearly 9 months,  but only been really seeing eachother for about 4 months. 
 I really shouldn't have started dating Rob. We'd been talking for a while and we were friends.   I'd only go and see him on days he was sober.  But over the course of a few months I started seeing him drunk /high.  And we started dating. 
 Most (aka every other person)  annoys me when they are drunk or drinking . I think they are complete asses. Even James.  Rob it doesn't bother me. 
 Rob is probably the nicest person and most honest person I've ever met in my life. He knows exactly what he is ( an active alcoholic) and he's honest about it. 
 He encourages me with my stressful job. Helps me grade papers  (only multiple choice stuff). He is cool just sitting with me for hours smoking cigs and looking at the sky and talking about nothing. 
He's never made me feel guilty about having a boyfriend. Or guilty or bad about anything.  As long as we are both just trying he's cool. If he thinks I can do better at something he tells me so, but I've never felt bad about it. 
 Rob and I go to shows together and watch movies. James isn't into either of those things. 
 I love Rob. He makes me calm. He holds me. I have GAD and he always says the exact right thing to help.  He says rediculous shit high but it's never bothered me.  I just ignore him when he's high and leave him alone. 
 We're both communist, neat freaks, and Alcoholics. 
 There is something about that disease regular people (non alcoholics) will never be able to relate to. Something that is such a huge part of my soul.   But he's an active alcoholic so I shouldn't see him. My sponsor just shakes her head at me I think. 
 Idk.  I love him.  Honestly more than I love James.  James knows this.  He just does his own thing. And I do mine.  It works for James and I. We live together.  It's unconventional but it works. 
 I broke up with Rob because he's an active and I can't love an active more than I love James. And I feel like a jerk. Like a dirty 13th stepper. 
 I feel crummy. Rob told me he loved me so I had to break things off. I was just such a poop all around. 
 If Rob was sober I'd dump James. But he's not.  And I need to accept that he probably won't ever be. 
 When I told James I had broken up with Rob, I asked James if we could be manogmous. He doesn't want to give up talking to other chicks and dating.

"Man, these days I have been feeling so lonely that I think I'm ashamed of feeling like this.  It's so bad that I cannot talk to women.  It is so unbelievably frustrating. 
 Worse so because I've been in relationships before, hell I was married!  We split up last year and I have to file for a divorce (waiting until August).  But anyway, breaking the ice for me is so difficult.  Once I do then all of a sudden I'm okay, I can make jokes and conversation and it's not too bad.   But the initial contact is an incredible barrier that feels unsurmountable to me. 
 To be honest, it's such a problem that even though I realized that my wife and I were not right for each other, I let it go for a long time because I could not imagine summoning the courage to meet somebody again.  (I met her through an old mutual friend so I was very comfortable from the start).  I finally split up with her because I couldn't take it any longer and felt that I deserved a better life for myself rather than be with someone whom I didn't love anymore.

"I'm just going to type this and see where it leads to, not sure how short or long or rantish I'll be, but I want to vent a bit and hear from anyone that's had any kind of similar experience. 
 Ok, so I am a 22 year old guy. I'm a senior in college, studying Psychology. In general, life has been alright lately, but I'm just not satisfied with things and I'm getting frustrated all the time, and don't feel like there's a lot to hope for. I have never been in a relationship. Nothing close to it. I have plenty of friends, best friends, I've been in leadership roles and mentorship roles too, so I think the people in my life that don't know me as well would be surprised to find that I have the insecurities that I do. I really am a normal person, not some creep lurking over a keyboard 24/7. 
 So I have yet to discover the joy of what it feels like to have that mutual attraction with someone, anyone. Haven't had a kiss, haven't had sex, not even hand holding unless it was a friend. And I'm just watching time and opportunities go by, while I'm just sort of stagnating here. Last year in the winter/spring I had a months long depression and a suicide attempt. At the end of the fall I was separated from my school for a semester. I really haven't had any success at anything in a long time now, and it's hard to get out of a cycle of failure. Even now that I'm back in school, things are ok but not the best. 
 Anyways, in the relationships context, I am really uncomfortable now with the idea of pursuing someone. It's just hard when you have a lifetime of experience telling you that you're not good enough or that it's never happened before so why would it now? In my head, I psyche myself up, get feeling good and confident about myself, tell myself that I would be good at this. But then I run into someone I might be attracted to. That whole mindset just goes to pieces. I end up not flirting, not doing anything that would show interest, I keep more neutral than Switzerland. It's sort of like I just shut the whole attraction thing down, just don't let myself feel it, and while it helps avoid vulnerabilities, all it does is create emptiness. I think for the past year or two I've become more boring because of all this. I think it's even getting to the point where some people just know me as a cynical, serious, bitter, asshole. I used to take comfort in this while I was in my fraternity, as it was useful for ordering younger guys around, but now it is slightly frightening. 
 The thing is, it's so terribly obvious what the thing is that keeps women uninterested, you know it, I know it: I'm overweight. I'm around 5'11"" height and weight approx. 250lbs. It's mostly in the gut and thighs, with some decent man-titty. It's not like I'm morbidly obese, though, my size is XL only. And while I don't think many would call me handsome, I do not see my face as being ugly either. But this weight thing, Jesus Christ, wtf. It's only gotten worse. When I came to school, I was around 200lbs. That's a big gain over 4 years. In high school, people made me think I was this huge elephant of a person. Now, I look back at pictures and cry because I really wasn't fat at all, just chubby, and I wish I knew it or could see it at the time because then I would think it was worth maintaining it. 
 But now, holy fuck, who has time for this shit? This isn't high school anymore when you call it a day at 2:30pm. There's only more work to do, more obligations, more anxiety and pressure. 
 God, and then, cherry on the fucking cake, is my scumbag of a penis. The level of sexual frustration here is TOO. DAMN. HIGH. I feel like I am dying at this point without any kind of physical stimulation with someone. I don't know how to handle it. But I'm really not interested in casual sex right now. Because of all the other shit, I just cannot trust someone that I wasn't already close with in such a vulnerable situation. So then that goes full circle back to how to get into dating when I am the way I am.

"My girlfriend and I started dating towards the end of our senior year of high school.  I fell for her so hard and she did the same.  We spent almost every day together in the summer and we never had a bad time.  Every single time we would hang out I would be the happiest guy ever, and her smile told me the same about her. 
 We both are now in college, and although she's only an hour away, it's still been a big change for us.  Not only being apart, but the shock of being a freshman in college took its toll on both of us.  We were constantly fighting and our relationship was turning very unhealthy, so we decided to take a break. 
 We both agreed that there were no restrictions on this break and if we got with other people, so be it.  We had no contact for about two weeks and she texted me late last night that she missed me so much and realized that she truly wanted to be with me. 
 We both agreed before we went NC that at the end of the break, we would talk about what happened with other people, which may have been the first mistake.  I had sex with one girl, realized that I didn't want to be with anyone else, and refrained from so much as kissing another girl.  She on the other hand had sex with two guys, and messed around with another. 
 I'm not mad at her for doing it, as we agreed on having no restrictions, but it does make me sad/uncomfortable.  Especially because she had been friends to the guy she messed around with prior and I didn't ask her to stop talking to him, but I did say I was uncomfortable with her hanging out with him anymore.  She said if they hung out again and he tries to make a move, she'll cut off contact.  I suppose I have no reason not to believe her but it still makes me a little queasy. 
 When I first heard all that she did, I was obviously a bit sick to my stomach, but it had gotten better over the next couple hours.  Now, however, an image of her with another guy will pop in to my head and I'll have a short outburst of crippling rage, to the point where I want to kill the guy.  I'm well aware this is obviously irrational but I'm not sure what to do about it.  My father has anger issues and I actively try to not ever be like that, but I think it's somewhat ingrained in me. 
 What I'm asking is 1) is it reasonable for me to ask her to stop hanging out with the one guy she messed around with and 2) what can I do to stop these outbursts?  Because I really do love her and want this to work, and I think she feels the same.","Girlfriend got with multiple other guys while on break, not mad at her since no restrictions were set, but can not get the images out of my head causing cases of severe short outbursts.

"I live in Brooklyn, in the absence of a good Charcoal Chicken (that's 'Rotisserie chicken' to you Americans),  I frequent my local fried chicken shop far too often - as a result I have got to know the store's operator quite well. We chat about the weeks events every time I'm in, and he calls me mate, we get along swimmingly. 
 He entered the US 15 years ago as an Afghan refugee, I estimate he's in his mid to late 40's, and he told me the day of the Boston bombings that he was, after 15 years, going for his citizenship interview the next day. Understandably, he was somewhat fearful that those responsible would turn out to be Middle-Eastern - thus adversely impacting his chances at success - and was laughing nervously about the possibility that he could miss out because of bad timing.

Besides just being really happy for him, I thought perhaps I could get him something to say 'welcome'. I'm not sure how he'll take it from a guy with an Australian accent (I am a US born Australian (Ameristralian!)), but I reckon that, given the shit I see him put up with every night I'm in the shop (it's not the best neighbourhood), he could do with a nice gesture. 
 I don't have heaps of cash lying around to put toward it but would appreciate creative suggestions!!","My local fried chicken guy from Afghanistan, has lived in the US for 15 years, becoming a citizen on Tuesday, want to get him something to say welcome.",47,M,Gifts
"I'm seeing that the debate on whether formulas should be given on tests or not is escalating in this thread. As a high school senior who has studied and has been tested in both conditions, I thought to chip in my personal view point here. Hopefully my comment will shed some light on the benefits and drawbacks of each condition. 
 I have studied in Iran for almost 10 years (up to my junior year in high school). In Iran, everyone is forced to take the same classes with everyone else (regardless of their skills and their future plans) up to the sophomore year in high school. After that each student can choose to study the Math-Physics course (equivalent to what is known as STEM in the US) - and has some really high level math and physics courses, ""Tajrobi"" (experimental) course - which is focused more on chemistry, biology, ... , or the accounting course - which has lower math level and is focused on educating people who want to be accountants or handle cash. There are also some courses for people who want to join the work force (Similar to technical courses in the US), which I'd omit for the sake of simplicity. 
The general rule of thumb in Iran is that you have to memorize every single formula in the book and there won't be any help during testing. It is rare that a teacher will make an exception on this rule, meaning that knowing the formula there is almost as important as knowing it's use. During testing I had to devote a good amount of my thinking time on remembering what the right formula was. Sometimes I knew how to solve a problem, but just couldn't recall the right formula, which resulted in me failing that test. It's fair to say that everyone, including me, hated that system and thought that it's unfair to make students memorize formulas. 
 Later during my junior year, I moved to the US. I got into a public high school in 2 months, but before being able to take classes, I had to test my math and english competency to figure out which level of math and english I was qualified to take. I didn't study before the test and just walked in and told the lady to give me the highest level of math I could take. She gave me an Algebra II test. I took the test and was able to get around 95% of the questions right without studying, which is somewhat impossible for American students without studying, and keep in mind that I was away from any math and studying for 6 months because I had to stay in a European country and wait for my US paper work and security clearance to be completed. Anyways, I got into high school and started a whole new life. As I had expected, the first 1-2 months was almost like a hell for me. I was overwhelmed by the amount of things I had to figure out to transition, and assimilate into American life, but one thing was never a problem for me. Yes you are guessing it right, academics. I took a trigonometry class the first semester, which was similar to what I had learned in Iran, but something was different. The teacher gave us a paper full of formulas during the testing, but I was able to get an A on the test without even looking at it. Most of the other students were not able to score well on the test even with the formulas. This made me somewhat happy, but also wondering that maybe the other system was more effective. The next semester I took statistics, which was a little different from what we had learned in Iran. There were new concepts and formulas I didn't know. I just went with the studying habit I used to use in Iran. I studied in class and didn't even bother to open my note book in home. Unlike other students, I wasn't stressed on test days and I could just get good scores without studying. If I didn't remember a formula, I could just look at the given paper. It was not because I was smart or something, given that I was just an average student in Iran and there were people much smarter than me in our school, but it was because memorizing formulas in Iran had trained my brain to have a better mathematical and analytical skills. 
 Having experienced the both conditions in my life, I can say that each of the conditions have their own benefits and drawbacks. 
 Forcing students to memorize formulas unfortunately works for the students who are really willing to do it, thus creating a big gap among students. Students who know the formula get a high score, but the ones who don't get very low scores, because even if they know how to solve a problem, they don't have the tool (formula) for it. However, the ones who studied can recall the formulas during their life time and it can help them in many life challenges. For instance, I, as a software developer, happen to use a lot of formulas that I remember from my years in Iran. 
 In the other hand giving the formulas to the students works for everyone. While it won't make much of a difference for top students, as they would learn the formulas even if it was not given, it makes a lot of difference for the average students, because if they have paid attention in class, and know how to solve the problem, the tool is there for them even if they haven't studied. However, the problem for this system comes in when seeing that a lot of students don't pay attention to the class, hoping that they will figure things out during the test using the given formulas, which doesn't happen usually. Yet another drawback for this system is that the when the students haven't memorized a formula, they even forget one exists after the test, meaning that if they ever want to use it later in they life, they just get stuck with a problem they don't know how to approach. If they don't know that there is a formula for problem X, how are they going to find it by looking it up? In contrast, people who have memorized them, will somewhat have a feeling that one exists and might even be able to recall some parts of it without looking up. They can later look up and correct they recalled formula if they messed it up at some point. 
 I hope that this wasn't too long and shed some light on each side of the debate. I would be happy to answer if you guys have any questions regarding the education system in Iran, or about my viewpoint.","Each system has its downs and ups, and may or may not work for a particular student.",18,M,news
"I like this one guy, (I'm a girl in hs), I think he likes me back, we always look at each other when we see each other, he was pretty nice to me last year, and from what I can tell, he seems pretty similar to me personalitywise, but with normal differences. Let's call him Boy A. 
 I just realized that one of my classmates/acquaintances/almostfriendbutibarelyknowhim seems to like me too. I'm pretty bad at realizing things at first, but I had a revelation. He is Boy B 
 Boy B is not really my type, and I just want to be friends with him. Too tall, etc. 
 I liked Boy A since last year, and when I decide I like someone, I want to pursue them, and only them. He is really attractive, and is nice, but doesn't act overly chivalrous like Boy B. 
 This is really like two questions in one, but my questions are 
 •Boy B is my almost friend, and I want to stay friends with him, but I don't want to hurt his feelings, what should I do, he just recently started flirting with me. 
 •Boy A is someone I really like, and want to get to know better, but he isn't in any of my classes, I switch 2 hours of school in second semester, so I might be in one of his classes later, how should I go about this? 
 (Note: this is at a pretty small school, so most people know each other) 
 Boy A is kind of introverted, and I feel like he might have a NT personality type, so he is less outgoing with the flirting and stuff, but we did have a few nice interactions","I don't know how to talk to the guy I like (who I think likes me back), and my friend who likes me isn't my type, but he just started flirting with me, but I still want to be his friend",17,F,relationship_advice
"This will probably get buried but back in 2007 my mom took my brother and I to a week long trip to Disney World. Back then I was what you would call a ""shy pooper."" I was very uncomfortable with pooping in any other toilet that wasn't my own; I never used the bathroom at malls, stores, restaurants, or school. I've since gotten over this and can use any toilet if need be, but I'll still hold in my poop if I'm out at a mall or at a store; the feeling goes away and I forget about it, I'm not clenching and straining the whole time haha. 
 But we arrived in Florida on a Saturday morning and we enjoyed our trip as much as we could. I was chubby back then so I was having my fill of all the delicious food from the restaurants and side vendors. I think I may have eaten two gigantic turkey legs while down there too, oh how delicious they were. Since it was an unframiliar setting, the urge to poop never really came up and I didn't think twice about it. It was going good so why question it? 
 Fast forward to Thursday night of our week trip down there and I'm finding myself having to poop pretty badly. Luckily I was in our hotel room at the time, (I don't think I would have been able to do this if I was at a public setting), and I went into our bathroom. I waited about 10 or so minutes to metally prepare myself for what was going to be my first poop at Disney World, and even Florida altogether, but when I started the routine I knew I screwed myself. 
 The only way that I can describe it with words is that it felt like I was trying to push the contents of a frozen water bottle through the top opening. I felt like while I was pushing my whole bottom was extruding out in the shape of a cylinder. My first attempts were futile and full of pain, and I wasn't able to make anything come out, I would have to stop and deal with the feeling of it all coming right back up. Have you ever felt a panic feeling when trying to drop a deuce? It's not very fun. 
 The only thought going through my mind was that it was do-or-die time and I needed to get this over with as fast as possible. I summoned all of my strength and mind power and pushed as hard as I could. It felt like it was moving slower than a glacier out of my ass and the pain was incredible. I started crying. 
 Yes. I started crying. I've never cried from taking a shit at any other point in my life but I feel like I cried enough to fill my quota for my whole life. 
 As it neared the releasing point I thought that it would all be over and the pain would go away. Some of you may know what I'm talking about but there's a second wave of pain after you release something like that out of your rectum. When it dropped into the porcielin bowl, the most awful burning, streching, and sore feeling shot through my rectum and I let out another wail as I kept crying. I felt like all my energy was sapped from me, and it took maybe about a good 30 to 40 minutes before I started to get up from the toilet seat. Three flushes later and it all went down. 
 The silver lining to this story is that at the time I had the hotel room to myself because my mom was taking my brother to the gift shop and I stayed behind. I don't want to think about how they would have reacted, or even if I still kept holding it past that point since they would have been there. 
 It was a pretty shitty situation.",I saved up 6 days worth of shit and tried pushing a brick cylinder through a dime sized hole.,20,M,AskReddit
"The background: I was teased brutally during grade school. In high school things got better, but I never put myself out there or tried to date anyone because I was so insecure. By grade 12 though, I was pretty happy with how I looked and knew I was heaps more attractive than I was in my awkward-looking days while being bullied. 
 In college, I got a lot of attention from guys. Had plenty of opportunities to have sex, but due to a combination of residual insecurity, fear of STDs, and the unknown of how I'd feel after being intimate with someone, I never took the opportunities. I dated a bit and ""hung out"" with a few guys during that time, but the one guy I was seeing long enough to consider it was a bit emotionally abusive. :/ 
 Anyways, moral of the story is I'm in my early twenties and have never had sex. I didn't grow up fearing it for religious reasons or anything, and my reason for waiting so long has nothing to do with doctrine or values. I'm really sex-positive and open. That also poses a problem when guys find out and they're like, ""What? You're a virgin but you're not religious?"" It seems so weird to people. 
 But the real problem is I feel like I can't wait any longer. I've always had a high sex drive ( very  easily turned on, open-minded to ""other"" things, etc.), and it's getting to the point where I  crave  being filled. Lately I've even had very descriptive, realistic dreams about it, almost as if my body and brain are acknowledging I can't wait any longer. 
 Apparently people consider me above average in looks these days, but guys making passes at me usually isn't a problem to ignore/disregard. But this feeling may be exacerbated by the fact that there's one guy in particular that I'm really attracted to, but I don't want to have casual sex with him because I know he's seeing other women as well. But the way I feel when we're hanging out, even if I'm just sitting next to him, is indescribable. My hormones are rushing and I just want him to have his way with me. I've never been so attracted to someone before, out of all the guys I've dated or hooked up with. 
 Even if I wasn't afraid of how I'd feel afterwards emotion-wise, perhaps my biggest fear is STDs. I don't want to take that risk after all this time with someone who hasn't been tested. Which is essentially the only reason I'd prefer being in a relationship before I ""lose it."" I treat my body very well and I'd hate for temptation to ruin that for someone I'm not even going to be with for the foreseeable future. 
 Does anyone have experiences with this? Because of my history with insecurity, part of me thinks I should just wait until I'm with someone who I know will treat me with respect, because I unfortunately have a habit of attracting guys who don't. But at the same time, I physically feel like I can't wait. I've talked to my friends, both guys and girls, and my desire for sex just seems so high in comparison and none of them can relate since they've essentially all been sexually active for years. 
 Sexxit, please help! Is this normal? Is this a phase? Do I just need to ""do it,"" or will this all blow over and I should continue waiting?","physically feel like I can't wait for sex anymore. I crave it all the time. Don't know what to do or if this is a normal situation that will blow over. It's lasted for over a month so far.

"Before you start reading I feel it's only fair to warn you that this is a horrendously long post, and if you're only here for the pictures, then I've put the gallery that they're all contained in right at the bottom. If you would like to read the story, continue. :-) 
 I only discovered this subreddit today, but I thought I'd let you know about my day at the Emirates, and one of the best and totally surreal days of my life. It's going to be hard to try and remember everything, but I'll try my best. 
 On April 25th RvP ran a competition on Twitter and told everyone that 1 lucky winner would get a few little presents. I entered thinking I had no chance but - why the hell not, you can't win if you don't enter! 
 The next day I was sat at home and wasn't paying much attention to twitter. I checked my mentions and I'd been spammed, my follow count was going out at an insane rate. I checked what they were saying in the comments and they were talking about RvP's competition, I didn't believe it at all so I checked his newsfeed, and what do you know.. Here's the [Tweet]( 
 Right after I checked my direct messages which are on the [Left]( along with the rest of the tweets leading up to and including the win. 
 At the time my parents were away on holiday and my brother was the only one here with me, and I didn't have enough money to sort flights out so I had to delegate that to my brother who was totally happy to help as long as I took him with me - deal. 
 It was 3 days before we were to fly to London I received  parcel delivered by [UPS]( I ran upstairs and carefully opened the packaging neatly laid on top was the ""[invoice]( I then pulled out the items. 
[1]( [2]( (One side is his autograph, the other side are the names of his kids. On the left is ""Shaqueel 11"" and the Netherlands flag and on the right is ""Dina Layla 11"" and the Netherlands flag. 
 A couple of minutes later my brother also got home from work with his girlfriend, so I asked him to take a picture of me holding van Persie's shirt and he was only too happy to [oblige]( 
 Before I get to talking about London and the Emirates, I'll post some more pictures from Twitter. [1]( [2]( [4]( and [5]( 
 May 5th my brother and I got up horrendously early and hauled ass to the airport and boarded our flight to Gatwick. 
 After getting multiple trains from Gatwick we arrived near the Emirates, we wandered around near a park where we saw this [sign]( so we took a photo of it. 
 We eventually made it to the Emirates where we walked around the outside of the stadium and took the standard photos of the statues of Adams, Henry, Chapman and then posed under a big Arsenal  crest  wandering around and looking  cool  a bit  lost  we got to the ticket office window 10. I didn't really know what to say to the lady behind the counter so I fluffed up my words and mentioned that I won Robin's competition and then just handed over my phone with a screenshot of the direct message from him, and she then handed over an [envelope]( If you can't read what it says at the bottom, it's ""COMP WINNER"". 
 I regret not taking a photo of the contents of the envelope now, hindsight is a wonderful thing. Nevertheless, contained inside that envelope were 2 club level, goal end tickets and 2 tickets for access to the players and family lounge before and after the game. My brother and I stood there gawking. 
 To get to the lounge we had to go through the media entrance shown  here 
 When in the player and family room we sat in the corner not really knowing what to do, there was no-one in there yet but we still felt a bit out of place. 10-15 minutes later in comes Jack Wilshere, Carl Jenkinson and Benik Afobe. Carl looks over and says ""Alright"", I manage an ""Alright"" back and they're already sat down on another bunch of chairs to our left. Jacks family are already there (including his baby), we really wanted an autograph, and another two people did go up to him and get one, but we felt really awkward and didn't want to interrupt him (in the end we didn't get an autograph from him at all, he was always with his family or baby and it would have felt rude). 
 Not long after in comes Pirès with his son. Pirès was my childhood hero, I had him on the back of every single one of my shirts growing up and when I play football I would always go on the left wing, just because of him. He sat right in front of us at a table with his son, I couldn't not ask him for an autograph and a photo, so I did, he kindly obliged and signed my programme, my brothers programme and posed for a photo with each of us. Here's my [Photo]( Again, please ignore the shit-eating grin and my stupid floppy hair. We also saw Frimpong who was hanging out with Lethal Bizzle and Benik Afobe and got Frimpong's autograph. 
 Bacary Sagna's wife came in with their kids, her brother and Bac's mother, his mother walked past us said ""Bonjour"" so I replied ""Bonjour"", she then sat down near Jack's family who now had Arteta's and Santos' wife sat down near them too. This is the game Sagna broke his leg again so after the game in the lounge they left early (presumably to join him in the hospital). His mum walked past us again and politely said ""Au revoir"" so I politely responded the same. 
 Back to the present we left around 15 minutes before the game had started so we could find our seats. We found them quite quickly and ended up taking the standard ""photo with back to the pitch"" photo, which can be seen  here  we ended up talking to the elevator guy about the season for a good 10 minutes or so. 
 After getting back to the lounge it was full of players family, but the players were obviously still in the changing rooms. After a little bit they started filtering through. 
I met a lot of the players and got lots of autographs (I will show you my autographed programme at the end). Arteta was standing in an alcove for the entrance to the toilets playing goalkeeper for a bunch of the kids there (RvP's son, RvP's nephew and Pirès' son. and some more, can't quite remember). 
 Finally RvP came in and started talking to a bunch of people I didn't want to be rude and interrupt him so I waited until he was finished and went up to say hello to him. The first thing he says? Ah! The winner! Philip right? So not only did he recognise me, he remembered my name and where I was from. We all started chatting after having our programmes signed by him and having a photo each with him, here's [mine]( once again please ignore the bemused look on my face and floppy annoying hair - he's a really down to earth guy. We ended up sitting down where Jacks family were earlier in the morning and chatting about anything, he had his daughter Dina Layla sat on his lap and he introduced his wife, Bouchra to us as well as his brother-in-law and his sister. We all just sat around chatting for a bit as if it was all normal. 
 My brother tried to get in a few sneaky snaps of footballers between conversations with Robin. I'll post them here: 
 [1]( Arteta in goal, [2]( Vermaelen to the left of the pillar, [3]( Arteta to the right of my mop.[4]( Benayoun and Arteta, [5]( Robin with Dina Layla, we were talking to him here. In the corner we're facing in this picture is where we originally sat, and where this photo is taken from is where Wilsheres family were originally sat, [6]( Just as we were leaving we saw Song leaving. Managed to get his autograph too. 
 After we left (we had a plane to catch) as we were trying to find our way back to the tube Song passed us in his (heavily modified, left hand drive) car and then randomly stopped in the middle of the road to sign some autographs out his window. I thought you'd like to see his car. [Here]( 
 Lastly, here is my matchday  programme  from memory: Coquelin, Benayoun, Gervinho, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Song, Vermaelen, Ramsey, Frimpong, Pirès, van Persie and Arteta.","Won RvP's competition on Twitter, went to the Emirates, met lots of players, had lots of fun, best day ever.

"I dislike long introductions, so... 
 Onwards, to how I willingly became a passive-aggressive food-hoarding queen:
> Me: 22, young, impressionable, trying to get rid of the last 20 pounds before ideal weight. Still have a knack for certain junk foods, especially if spicy. Also buy a lot of food I forget about until I get hit by a craving three months later (relevant). 
 > Lilac: my portly apartment-mate, a wonderful girl, but fatlogic up to her teeth. Shamed by her family for being fat and so hides her disordered eating habit. Also in the tendency to steal food and (only partially) replace it at a later date. 
 On a fateful summer day I came back from work a desiccated husk of overheated, overworked and underpaid grad student. It's already 9 PM and I hadn't had anything to eat since noon, because work was hell, school was hell and I just wanted to curl up into a foetal ball and munch on my Goddamned pack of vinegar chips/crisps and boiled frankfurters. 
 I put myself on auto-pilot, start the water and trudge on the five steps to our pantry to find...the snack shelf empty. WTF? I know for a fact that two weeks ago I had bought six small packs of vinegar chips, two bags of hard candy and one pack of those small pretzelish things. I hadn't had any of these! 
 ""Lilac, you awake?"" I said and promptly the most enticing aroma of (you guessed it) lilac entered my nostrils as my roomie waltzed out of her den, all flowery in disposition. 
 ""Yeah...oh, don't bother looking for chips and stuff, they expired so I threw them away. I told you to stop buying things and leaving them around forever."" and I swear to you, she could have been painted on the Sistine chapel with that angel face on. 
 I feel the righteous fury of Adrestia, our patron goddess of retribution, but clamp my yap shut and proceed to the refrigerator. Wherein, my curvaceous beauties, I only find one last frankfurter buried between the manifold veggies I (still) owned. Disgruntled, but not yet tipped over the edge, I proceed to boil it and eat it grudgingly with sub-grade mustard, while Lilac and I chatted away about our day. 
 Surely, she probably threw the others away because, indeed, they were beginning to feel less-than-fresh. Right? Right? 
 This goes on for a couple of more weeks, while I start to get the stinkin' feeling that she's not quite as religious as I thought about keeping the pantry and fridge clean of food that's trying to evolve. My first clue were two suspicious candy wrappers in her room, then packs of crisps hidden away carefully in our trash. Then packs and packages of things reappearing when I'd given up on them (e.g. two Oreo sleeves suddenly becoming three again) 
 All of this while she earns more than me and is supposedly dieting alongside with me. Worst of all, I was just restricting calories, she was on this full-fledged Dukan diet that is very carb-restrictive. 
 So I come up with a plan, I think up a stink and I think it up quick. I love me some weird cuisine (as if frankfurters and chips didn't weird you out already) and have a love-hate relationship with wasabi coated peanuts. She did not know what those were.   cue evil laughter  
 So I bought a little tin of those pain-inducing pleasures, took the top off and left them on the table with the plastic lid on, nestled in between the salt and pepper shakers. I do that quite a lot with regular peanuts and just forget about them for days, so this was standard behaviour for me. Then I popped into my room to devour books. 
 Not twenty minutes in, my darlings, I hear the most righteous banshee wail that ever graced my aural canal. It was as if thousands of buttholes screamed and then puckered up in expectation of wasabi-fueled hatred spewing out in 24 hours. 
 ""Lilac, what's wrong? What happened?"" I literally trip over myself to go to the kitchen and I see my roomie with her head either alternatively in the sink or chugging milk straight out of the carton, while there's a green mess on the table. 
 ""I can't believe you tried to poison me! What the hell were those things?"" 
 I calmly amble to the faucet, turn the tap off, look her in the eyes and smile: 
 "" My  food. Stop eating it."" 
 It was glorious, it was beautiful and it was what the goddess of retribution demanded. I'd like to say that there was some huge, significant fallout but no, we're both adults and we sat down to discuss what had happened once our tempers cooled down. She finally opened up to me about her secret eating and apologised for stealing my food. 
 And so we progressed from mere people sharing an apartment to friends...","Moral of the story: don't steal food from starving grad students, but do be a good lad/lass and apologize when you've done it.",22,F,fatpeoplestories
"warning: long read)
 
 Greetings lads. I'm an 18 year old who has quite a confusion in my life. Although from a young age I was a very independent kid, I feel like I currently need guidance like never before. I'll try to keep this as short and as structured as possible. Feel free to answer as much of my questions as you want. 
 Shortly about myself: from eastern Europe, living without parents since 15 (got into the country's best high school in a distant city), dangerously adventurous, very sociable. My father likes to tell me that I have a ""good head"" and I feel like I really do, but this kind of ruined me. I've become a little arrogant and even narcissistic at times, but I'm a master at hiding it and successfully using the placebo effect this gives me. I never did any homework in school, but still got very good or at least decent results. Being able to outsmart people caused me to earn some sociopathic traits, which I both hate and love. I also love aviation more than anything. 
 Off to the problems I face: 
 General path, career and finance: I'm currently a freshman in a university. Industrial technology management is what I study. Chose it due to the potential this speciality has, novelty in my country (I will be of the first generation of industrial managers) and management part. I recently got an internship at an aviation services company, but it consists only of working as a phone book filler 4 hours a day, non-paid (3 monhs). Although aviation is what I love and I'd like to work in that company in the future, but lately this internship bothers me a lot. Why? Because I currently live for roughly ~37$ a week and I feel like I should have found a paid job instead of an internship which brings me very little experience. I feel really bad for not being able to engage all the fun stuff my peers are doing due to my financial situation. This even caused me to borrow some money (small amount, which is relatively big to me) which I'm currently unable to return. What would you do in my situation? Buckle up and continue my internship or find a paid job? Maybe I can do something else to earn money without leaving internship? 
 Friends and women: I am overloaded with social energy and try to use it in the most effective way possible. I read about body language and evolutionary psychology, because I love to have upper hand in communicating and being able to explain why we are the way we are. But this social pragmatism often doesn't sit on the same page with morality. I also really like to often change people I'm communicating with. Usually I get bored with a person in less than a week if I'm continuously get into contact with him. This causes me to go from a person to person befriending them, sucking some social energy from them and then levitating away. It's my drug, it makes me feel good about myself because I'm able to do that so easily. Same goes with girls - I've had only one girlfriend (for a staggering one month) but had countless short-term affairs. It sounds cool and fun, and it sort of is, but then it gets lonely... Problem is that this seems unsolvable. I just can't force myself to be more constant with people, because they get uninteresting so fast. I'm not even able to form an exact question here, but maybe there are guys who are in similar situation and could share their experiences of how to get that long-term loneliness away? 
 Habits: I have all the worst habits you can imagine. Messy, lack of studying habits, occasional liar, smoker (both weed and cigs), no working out, skipping classes. I prioritize short-term instead of long-term way too much. I feel like a mixture of a hedonist and a nihilist.  I'm conscious of my shortcomings but am unable to change them, because each time I try to, my brain just outsmarts me, finds logical and philosophical grounds to abolish all the commitments I make to myself. The worst thing is that despite all my shitty habits I'm doing fucking great - best high school, best university of my field in the country, good grades at all times (how do you get yourself to study, when you can get good results without doing it?), popular at uni, beloved by both parents and friends. It's very hard to motivate yourself to change when everything is going so well but at the same time it kind of doesn't... I don't trust myself.

"I hate those prisons. I truly hate them. I'm really sorry you had to go through what I went... I guess I'll share my story, and hopefuly I'll make some people realize that these camps are... more than evil. 
 As a kid I really denied any form of authority. I often harrased teachers, and the idea of a great man in the sky ruling over me was not only ridicoulous to me, but also hazardous... I came out to my (extremist) parents at the age of 14. They cried, threatened me, did everything they could to turn me back into a robot... 
 About 1 month after I came out, 3 men came into my house at night, and told me to stay quiet and walk with them. I tought it was a kidnapping, as most people who experience this... 
 I walked into the van, and they explained themselelves. I was shocked and filled with hate, but I knew I shouldn't do anything, the van was small and I couldn't defend myself. 
 My first day at that prison was horrible... everything I did was supervised, and also controlled. The only time I got some ""privacy"" was at night, 10 o'clock. After 1 week I just couldn't take the authority, and I was put in isolation. Two months. Two. fucking. Months. 
 After the first month I began hearing voices in my head, and after another week, the voices formed into a big, strong voice... I only had one conversation with it. 
 Voice : ""Escape."" 
 Me : ""How?"" 
 Voice : ""Strong. Then Kill."" 
 After the last sentence I never heard it again. But it was enough. I knew my goal. At the time I had about 100 lbs... I was skinny, I didn't have force... I was helpless. 
 Every time I got out of isolation, I said ""fuck God."". All I did in isolation was exercise. I was so full of hate I didn't care about time... In there there was no natural light, just a little crack... I had no clock, so I would just look at the crack while exercising.. Everytime light started to get through the crack, meaning it was day, it was a great achievment. I felt.. great. Small things where all I had, so it was incredible... I exercised in there for 8 months... breaks of 20 minutes, exercises for 1 and a half. And repeat. Repeat. Repeat... 
 After 8 months, I finnaly got out... everyone was so surprised I didn't shout ""fuck God."". 
 For about 4 days I was heavily looked at by all the guards... that was the day I began the brainwashing. They thought the isolation broke me down. It only made me stronger. 
 Everytime I entered the brainwashing room I would see a broken window. The room was on the first floor, so I could get out without too much damage. But I was... nowhere. Nowhere meaning a forest. I could run, of course, but how long would the forest last? I didn't know. Forest was freedom. Freedom is good. So I got to get in the forest. 
 One day, instead of the 5 athletic guys that went with me to the room, there were only 2 janitors. I was so surprised... yet calm. I knew that was my day. 
 As I was approaching the window, I felt some adrenaline going up my spine... 
 I quickly headlocked one guy while kicking the other with one foot, and managed to pull a neck break on the headlocked guy.. I got ready, then jumped off the window. I fell, rolled, and managed to don't get hurt bad... I was running, running, running... I could hear some sounds, but I was so thrilled I didn't pay attention.. after about 4km running I finnaly stopped. I could feel freedom. It was... beautiful. 
 I heard a ""fuck! Watch how you're driving, man!"". My instinct moved me, and I approaced a yellow car... 
 ""Please.. just.. let me come."" 
 The guy looked at me surprised, then told me to get in. After about half an hour, when I recovered, he asked me my story, but I was still afraid. What if he would get me to the cops? What if he was one of them? I didn't know. I just said ""No time to explain. Where are you going?"". He said Florida. 
 I arrived in Florida at the age of 15. I'm 19 now, and I never spoke with my parents again, and will never do it. I truly hate them. 
 But the experience made me realize how important free will is. .. aaaaand I grew fucking awesome muscles. 
 Thanks for reading so far :)! I means a lot to me that I can share my story... it hurts even now, after 4 years.","It took me 1 year to escape but, it takes you only 5 minutes to read. 
 EDIT : Thanks for all your support guys! It's been 4 years since I escaped, so I had plenty of time to rebuild my life, and to find a job. I work right now as a Pentester, Programmer and a skater, which is more than I could have achieved while I was with my parents :) 
Anyone here gonna share his story? I figured out we could make a little book out of them, and if we would really sue those prisons, every story counts!",19,M,circlejerk
"This happened when I was 18 years old. I grew up in a rural area and the school bus didn't get to my house until almost 5:00 PM so I drove to school but I couldn't get to the elementary school before the bus left to pick up my sisters so I would goof off in town and then wait for them at the end of our driveway. Anyway, I was waiting on the bus at the end of my driveway, which was about a mile long, and my sisters would stand on my bumper and I would drive them to the house. Well, on this day, as my sisters got off the bus, I saw my middle sister, who was about 9 at the time, crying harder than I had ever seen her cry. The bus basically tore off as she stepped off and when I was able to finally get her to calm down, she told me that a kid pulled her pants down on the bus and put his hand between her legs. She told me who it was and I freaked out because this kid was a senior like me at my high school. This set me off. I had a reputation as a fighter and I had a hair trigger temper. I just jumped in my car and tore off after the bus in my truck. I caught the bus right as it stopped to let this kid off at his house. He saw my truck and ran like hell to his house. I just drove after him in his yard, honestly I was trying to run him over. He made it to his door and shut it and locked it right as I got there. That's when he made his second mistake. He had a little diamond shaped window at head level and he looked out through it and smirked. Big mistake. I put my fist right through that window and connected square with his nose. I pulled my fist out and kicked his door in. I pretty much tried to kill him when several men pulled me off of him. The bus driver flagged down a construction truck and the men ran in to save the guy I was trying to kill. They held me down as long as they could but I got loose and ran to my truck and made it back to my house. My parents met me in the driveway and were very worried about what I might have done to this guy. My folks were torn because they would have done the same thing in my shoes, especially my dad. We just waited for the police to arrive, which they did. The cops were pretty cool and basically said they didn't blame me but I did break the law, several of them, actually. I was charged with aggravated assault, burglary, criminal trespass, and assault with a motor vehicle. Eventually all charges were reduced and I walked away but it cost about $20,000 in attorney fees. I was put on probation and after 6 months, my record was expunged. The other guy wasn't as lucky. He got 12 months to serve in the county farm for child molestation. When he got out, I tuned him up once more for good measure. I have no regrets.",I beat up my sister's molester and got arrested.,18,M,tifu
I was an idiot that did much of the same thing. I was about 16 babysitting a hyper active girl around 8. So I decided it would be fun to make gel candles. Bad idea she found something else interesting and I chased after her forgetting about the stove. Well at about this time my older brother comes in the house and sees a pot with fire in it. His first reaction (not knowing what was inside the pot) was to throw it in the sink and pour water on it; well this causes a spout of fire to shoot up and singe the ceiling. He then takes the pot and throws it out onto our front yard where he sprays the shit out of it with the garden hose until the fire is out. I still haven't lived that story down.,I'm a dumbass and my brother saved our house from burning down from me making candles.,16,F,AskReddit
"This is my full story. I have been a lurker for a long time now and I am happy to be joining up and sharing my experience. soz if bad grammer :) 
 I am 16 and in my last year of high school (UK). Last November I fell pregnant after being raped by a person I knew through a friend. It was a very distressing and scary experience for me, and although I had the support of my remaining friends (there were those who supported the rapist), most of my teachers and my family, finding out I was pregnant made me feel physically sick - more violated than after the act that caused it. After attempting several times to terminate the pregnancy, my terror got the better of me, and I decided to consider alternatives. To cut a long story short, I found a loving couple who will take the child and raise him/her as their own. They have a young boy of their own who is 6. He is a sweet, intelligent kid who is not afraid to ask questions and is looking forward to having a younger sibling. 
 I feel very (for want of a better word :D) detached from the child...I have not prepared for it the way a mother would normally, and I do not know the gender, but I can tell you that both the baby and I are healthy for now. 
 Knowing that my child will go to a wonderful home makes me very happy indeed. What I have trouble with is dealing with the memory of the rape. The ever-growing reminder of it does not help, and I find myself watching back-to-back comedy, or movies that make me feel happy (disney, dreamworks, etc.) to keep myself constantly distracted. 
 Please instill some assurance into me, reddit! Help me know mountains like this can be climbed, and do tell what methods you used to stay sane and happy!","Giving my baby away (after much thought) to loving couple, but find it difficult to deal with the memory of my rape.",16,F,AskReddit
"It was the night before this school dance, and I was pretty pumped up. Me, being one of those preteens who just started shaving, decided that I should give my face a once over with the razor. 
 Big mistake. 
 I had a mole of my face, the keyword being HAD, because me being a cocky ass 7th grader, I thought that I was a man and that shaving was fun. 
 So I ran over the mole. 
 I had to run to the nearest pharmacy and get one of those sticks that you stop the bleeding with. It didn't work. 
 Two types of aftershaves didn't work. 
 I went to the dance with a bleeding face and smelling like a bad pimp. 
 That bitch bled for 4 hours, all through the dance, it was horrible. 
 I had those small band-aids, the ones you get after a vaccination, and every 5 or 10 minutes I'd have to change it because the blood kept saturating the band-aid.","I thought I was cool, turns out I just bled for four hours and smelled good.",13,M,AskReddit
"27 male in Seattle, looking for something a bit odd here. 
 I have a long term GF, who is asexual, so we are in an open relationship to alleviate that. I have some FWB who are cool, but no girls I know like lewd shit as much as I do.

"It was never meant to be a long term relationship. Due to our age differences and as I got to know her I realized she had a serious drinking problem: two DUI's, court mandated ankle monitor to read her alcohol levels (that was later), and she's psychotic when she's drunk. While I was in the process of breaking up with her she found a lump in her breast and weeks later was diagnosed with breast cancer, shit. I tend to be codependent, I can admit that. there was no way I could leave her when she's going through all of this(son of a cancer survivor). I was honest about how felt about our relationship and we did a off and on relationship that involved tons of heart ache and remorse. She made it through surgery and didn't need chemo. Our back and forth continued throughout her recovery. Until finally two months ago we attended a party where she drank too much and had a psychotic episode and screamed that I was hitting her, if it wasn't for my neighbors who witnessed the whole thing I could have been arrested for domestic abuse. 
 She tried to reestablish contact with me numerous times after that night I told her that we were bad together and we both needed help. I then blocked her number,  I filter her emails, and blocked her on Facebook. Since all of this happened I'm starting to notice that my friends are not speaking to me or reaching out. I celebrated my 35th birthday alone. It was depressing and still is.

"Just a little background: IAMA poor college studENT looking for any way possible to earn about $4000 so that I can study abroad in Australia this summer.
